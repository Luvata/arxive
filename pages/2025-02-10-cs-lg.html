<p><b>Authors:</b> Reyhaneh Sabbagh Gol, Dimitar Valkov, Lars Linsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand kinematics can be measured in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with the intention to predict the user's intention in a reach-to-grasp action. Using multiple hand sensors, multivariate time series data are being captured. Given a number of possible actions on a number of objects, the goal is to classify the multivariate time series data, where the class shall be predicted as early as possible. Many machine-learning methods have been developed for such classification tasks, where different approaches produce favorable solutions on different data sets. We, therefore, employ an ensemble approach that includes and weights different approaches. To provide a trustworthy classification production, we present the XMTC tool that incorporates coordinated multiple-view visualizations to analyze the predictions. Temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots allow for the identification of the best trade-off between early prediction and prediction quality, the detection and analysis of challenging classification conditions, and the investigation of the prediction evolution in an overview and detail manner. We employ XMTC to real-world HCI data in multiple scenarios and show that good classification predictions can be achieved early on with our classifier as well as which conditions are easy to distinguish, which multivariate time series measurements impose challenges, and which features have most impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokeng Zheng, Bo Rao, Tianxiang Zhu, Chee Wei Tan, Jingpu Duan, Zhi Zhou, Xu Chen, Xiaoxi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban living.Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Gai, Mohan Wang, Jing Yu, Dongjue Wang, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models on multimodal data while ensuring clients' privacy. However, modality and task heterogeneity hinder clients from learning a unified representation, weakening local model generalization, especially in MFL with mixed modalities where only some clients have multimodal data. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities and heterogeneous tasks to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without a prior public dataset. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with tasks; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and aggregates them to form global prototypes, avoid clients keeping unified labels. We divide the model into various modules and only aggregate mapping modules to reduce communication and computation overhead. To address aggregation issues in heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence effectiveness of AproMFL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccol\`o Grillo, Andrea Toccaceli, Jo\"el Mathys, Benjamin Estermann, Stefania Fresca, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite incredible progress, many neural architectures fail to properly generalize beyond their training distribution. As such, learning to reason in a correct and generalizable way is one of the current fundamental challenges in machine learning. In this respect, logic puzzles provide a great testbed, as we can fully understand and control the learning environment. Thus, they allow to evaluate performance on previously unseen, larger and more difficult puzzles that follow the same underlying rules. Since traditional approaches often struggle to represent such scalable logical structures, we propose to model these puzzles using a graph-based approach. Then, we investigate the key factors enabling the proposed models to learn generalizable solutions in a reinforcement learning setting. Our study focuses on the impact of the inductive bias of the architecture, different reward systems and the role of recurrent modeling in enabling sequential reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how these elements contribute to successful extrapolation on increasingly complex puzzles.These insights and frameworks offer a systematic way to design learning-based systems capable of generalizable reasoning beyond interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Chen, Xiaotian Song, Andy Song, BaDong Chen, Jiancheng Lv, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models have been shown as a good alternative to LLMs in various scenarios. Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct training and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and relatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking LLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of pre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The second stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce conversion errors and improve accuracy. Our experiments on both language and vision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced inference latency and computational costs. For example, FAS only takes 8 timesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3% higher than that of the OPT-7B model, while reducing energy consumption by 96.63%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Gopakumar, Ander Gray, Lorenzo Zanisi, Timothy Nunn, Stanislas Pamela, Daniel Giles, Matt J. Kusner, Marc Peter Deisenroth</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural PDEs offer efficient alternatives to computationally expensive numerical PDE solvers for simulating complex physical systems. However, their lack of robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) limits deployment in critical applications. We introduce a model-agnostic, physics-informed conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides guaranteed uncertainty estimates without requiring labelled data. By utilising a physics-based approach, we are able to quantify and calibrate the model's inconsistencies with the PDE rather than the uncertainty arising from the data. Our approach uses convolutional layers as finite-difference stencils and leverages physics residual errors as nonconformity scores, enabling data-free UQ with marginal and joint coverage guarantees across prediction domains for a range of complex PDEs. We further validate the efficacy of our method on neural PDE models for plasma modelling and shot design in fusion reactors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Kakooee, Benjamin Dillenburger</p>
<p>Abstract: Space layout design (SLD), occurring in the early stages of the design process, nonetheless influences both the functionality and aesthetics of the ultimate architectural outcome. The complexity of SLD necessitates innovative approaches to efficiently explore vast solution spaces. While image-based generative AI has emerged as a potential solution, they often rely on pixel-based space composition methods that lack intuitive representation of architectural processes. This paper leverages deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), as it offers a procedural approach that intuitively mimics the process of human designers. Effectively using RL for SLD requires an explorative space composing method to generate desirable design solutions. We introduce "laser-wall", a novel space partitioning method that conceptualizes walls as emitters of imaginary light beams to partition spaces. This approach bridges vector-based and pixel-based partitioning methods, offering both flexibility and exploratory power in generating diverse layouts. We present two planning strategies: one-shot planning, which generates entire layouts in a single pass, and dynamic planning, which allows for adaptive refinement by continuously transforming laser-walls. Additionally, we introduce on-light and off-light wall transformations for smooth and fast layout refinement, as well as identity-less and identity-full walls for versatile room assignment. We developed SpaceLayoutGym, an open-source OpenAI Gym compatible simulator for generating and evaluating space layouts. The RL agent processes the input design scenarios and generates solutions following a reward function that balances geometrical and topological requirements. Our results demonstrate that the RL-based laser-wall approach can generate diverse and functional space layouts that satisfy both geometric constraints and topological requirements and is architecturally intuitive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ferrante, Alessandra Carosi, Rolando Maria D Angelillo, Nicola Toschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiotherapy is a crucial cancer treatment that demands precise planning to balance tumor eradication and preservation of healthy tissue. Traditional treatment planning (TP) is iterative, time-consuming, and reliant on human expertise, which can potentially introduce variability and inefficiency. We propose a novel framework to transform a large multimodal foundation model (MLM) into an action model for TP using a few-shot reinforcement learning (RL) approach. Our method leverages the MLM's extensive pre-existing knowledge of physics, radiation, and anatomy, enhancing it through a few-shot learning process. This allows the model to iteratively improve treatment plans using a Monte Carlo simulator. Our results demonstrate that this method outperforms conventional RL-based approaches in both quality and efficiency, achieving higher reward scores and more optimal dose distributions in simulations on prostate cancer data. This proof-of-concept suggests a promising direction for integrating advanced AI models into clinical workflows, potentially enhancing the speed, quality, and standardization of radiotherapy treatment planning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04409">Learning low-dimensional representations of ensemble forecast fields using autoencoder-based methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieyu Chen, Kevin H\"ohlein, Sebastian Lerch</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations often produce high-dimensional gridded data that is challenging to process for downstream applications. A prime example is numerical weather prediction, where atmospheric processes are modeled using discrete gridded representations of the physical variables and dynamics. Uncertainties are assessed by running the simulations multiple times, yielding ensembles of simulated fields as a high-dimensional stochastic representation of the forecast distribution. The high-dimensionality and large volume of ensemble datasets poses major computing challenges for subsequent forecasting stages. Data-driven dimensionality reduction techniques could help to reduce the data volume before further processing by learning meaningful and compact representations. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are typically designed for deterministic and single-valued inputs, and thus cannot handle ensemble data from multiple randomized simulations. In this study, we propose novel dimensionality reduction approaches specifically tailored to the format of ensemble forecast fields. We present two alternative frameworks, which yield low-dimensional representations of ensemble forecasts while respecting their probabilistic character. The first approach derives a distribution-based representation of an input ensemble by applying standard dimensionality reduction techniques in a member-by-member fashion and merging the member representations into a joint parametric distribution model. The second approach achieves a similar representation by encoding all members jointly using a tailored variational autoencoder. We evaluate and compare both approaches in a case study using 10 years of temperature and wind speed forecasts over Europe. The approaches preserve key spatial and statistical characteristics of the ensemble and enable probabilistic reconstructions of the forecast fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunfeng Lai, Zhenheng Tang, Xinglin Pan, Peijie Dong, Xiang Liu, Haolan Chen, Li Shen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehua Pei, Lancheng Zou, Hui-Ling Zhen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance by scaling model parameters, but this comes with significant inference overhead. Feed-forward networks (FFNs), which dominate LLM parameters, exhibit high activation sparsity in hidden neurons. To exploit this, researchers have proposed using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where only a subset of parameters is activated. However, existing approaches often require extensive training data and resources, limiting their practicality. We propose CMoE (Carved MoE), a novel framework to efficiently carve MoE models from dense models. CMoE achieves remarkable performance through efficient expert grouping and lightweight adaptation. First, neurons are grouped into shared and routed experts based on activation rates. Next, we construct a routing mechanism without training from scratch, incorporating a differentiable routing process and load balancing. Using modest data, CMoE produces a well-designed, usable MoE from a 7B dense model within five minutes. With lightweight fine-tuning, it achieves high-performance recovery in under an hour.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edgar Ramirez-Sanchez, Catherine Tang, Yaosheng Xu, Nrithya Renganathan, Vindula Jayawardana, Zhengbing He, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The transportation sector significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating accurate emission models to guide mitigation strategies. Despite its field validation and certification, the industry-standard Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) faces challenges related to complexity in usage, high computational demands, and its unsuitability for microscopic real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present NeuralMOVES, a comprehensive suite of high-performance, lightweight surrogate models for vehicle CO2 emissions. Developed based on reverse engineering and Neural Networks, NeuralMOVES achieves a remarkable 6.013% Mean Average Percentage Error relative to MOVES across extensive tests spanning over two million scenarios with diverse trajectories and the factors regarding environments and vehicles. NeuralMOVES is only 2.4 MB, largely condensing the original MOVES and the reverse engineered MOVES into a compact representation, while maintaining high accuracy. Therefore, NeuralMOVES significantly enhances accessibility while maintaining the accuracy of MOVES, simplifying CO2 evaluation for transportation analyses and enabling real-time, microscopic applications across diverse scenarios without reliance on complex software or extensive computational resources. Moreover, this paper provides, for the first time, a framework for reverse engineering industrial-grade software tailored specifically to transportation scenarios, going beyond MOVES. The surrogate models are available at https://github.com/edgar-rs/neuralMOVES.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of autotelic Reinforcement Learning (RL), emphasizing the role of intrinsic motivations in the open-ended formation of skill repertoires. We delineate the distinctions between knowledge-based and competence-based intrinsic motivations, illustrating how these concepts inform the development of autonomous agents capable of generating and pursuing self-defined goals. The typology of Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) is explored, with a focus on the implications for multi-goal RL and developmental robotics. The autotelic learning problem is framed within a reward-free Markov Decision Process (MDP), WHERE agents must autonomously represent, generate, and master their own goals. We address the unique challenges in evaluating such agents, proposing various metrics for measuring exploration, generalization, and robustness in complex environments. This work aims to advance the understanding of autotelic RL agents and their potential for enhancing skill acquisition in a diverse and dynamic setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Li, Hao Chen, Yang Wang, Tingyuan Zhu, Weijia Zhang, Kaijie Zhu, Kam-Fai Wong, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets via large language models (LLMs) themselves has emerged as a promising approach to improve LLM performance. However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.</p>

<p>Abstract: Referral workflow inefficiencies, including misaligned referrals and delays, contribute to suboptimal patient outcomes and higher healthcare costs. In this study, we investigated the possibility of predicting procedural needs based on primary care diagnostic entries, thereby improving referral accuracy, streamlining workflows, and providing better care to patients. A de-identified dataset of 2,086 orthopedic referrals from the University of Texas Health at Tyler was analyzed using machine learning models built on Base General Embeddings (BGE) for semantic extraction. To ensure real-world applicability, noise tolerance experiments were conducted, and oversampling techniques were employed to mitigate class imbalance. The selected optimum and parsimonious embedding model demonstrated high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.874, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): 0.540), effectively distinguishing patients requiring surgical intervention. Dimensionality reduction techniques confirmed the model's ability to capture meaningful clinical relationships. A threshold sensitivity analysis identified an optimal decision threshold (0.30) to balance precision and recall, maximizing referral efficiency. In the predictive modeling analysis, the procedure rate increased from 11.27% to an optimal 60.1%, representing a 433% improvement with significant implications for operational efficiency and healthcare revenue.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daman Arora, Andrea Zanette</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.
  In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Della Libera, Francesco Paissan, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Denker, Shreyas Padhy, Francisco Vargas, Johannes Hertrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using the $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Arabzadeh, Farshad Almasganj, Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods have been widely used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using recorded signals from Iner-tial Measurement Units (IMUs) sensors that are installed on various parts of the human body. For this type of HAR, sev-eral challenges exist, the most significant of which is the analysis of multivarious IMU sensors data. Here, we introduce a Hierarchically Unsupervised Fusion (HUF) model designed to extract, and fuse features from IMU sensors data via a hybrid structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)s and Autoencoders (AE)s. First, we design a stack CNN-AE to embed short-time signals into sets of high dimensional features. Second, we develop another CNN-AE network to locally fuse the extracted features from each sensor unit. Finally, we unify all the sensor features through a third CNN-AE architecture as globally feature fusion to create a unique feature set. Additionally, we analyze the effects of varying the model hyperparameters. The best results are achieved with eight convolutional layers in each AE. Furthermore, it is determined that an overcomplete AE with 256 kernels in the code layer is suitable for feature extraction in the first block of the proposed HUF model; this number reduces to 64 in the last block of the model to customize the size of the applied features to the classifier. The tuned model is applied to the UCI-HAR, DaLiAc, and Parkinson's disease gait da-tasets, achieving the classification accuracies of 97%, 97%, and 88%, respectively, which are nearly 3% better com-pared to the state-of-the-art supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Cheng, Tianyu Xie, Shiyue Zhang, Cheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04495">Discovering Physics Laws of Dynamical Systems via Invariant Function Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shurui Gui, Xiner Li, Shuiwang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider learning underlying laws of dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODE). A key challenge is how to discover intrinsic dynamics across multiple environments while circumventing environment-specific mechanisms. Unlike prior work, we tackle more complex environments where changes extend beyond function coefficients to entirely different function forms. For example, we demonstrate the discovery of ideal pendulum's natural motion $\alpha^2 \sin{\theta_t}$ by observing pendulum dynamics in different environments, such as the damped environment $\alpha^2 \sin(\theta_t) - \rho \omega_t$ and powered environment $\alpha^2 \sin(\theta_t) + \rho \frac{\omega_t}{\left|\omega_t\right|}$. Here, we formulate this problem as an \emph{invariant function learning} task and propose a new method, known as \textbf{D}isentanglement of \textbf{I}nvariant \textbf{F}unctions (DIF), that is grounded in causal analysis. We propose a causal graph and design an encoder-decoder hypernetwork that explicitly disentangles invariant functions from environment-specific dynamics. The discovery of invariant functions is guaranteed by our information-based principle that enforces the independence between extracted invariant functions and environments. Quantitative comparisons with meta-learning and invariant learning baselines on three ODE systems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, symbolic regression explanation results highlight the ability of our framework to uncover intrinsic laws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zony Yu, Yuqiao Wen, Lili Mou</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method of transferring knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a small "student" model. KD can be divided into two categories: prediction matching and intermediate-layer matching. We explore an intriguing phenomenon: layer-selection strategy does not matter (much) in intermediate-layer matching. In this paper, we show that seemingly nonsensical matching strategies such as matching the teacher's layers in reverse still result in surprisingly good student performance. We provide an interpretation for this phenomenon by examining the angles between teacher layers viewed from the student's perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Fan, Jingru Fei, Dingyu Guo, Kun Yi, Xiaozhuang Song, Haolong Xiang, Hangting Ye, Min Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical time series has been playing a vital role in real-world healthcare systems as valuable information in monitoring health conditions of patients. Accurate classification for medical time series, e.g., Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, can help for early detection and diagnosis. Traditional methods towards medical time series classification rely on handcrafted feature extraction and statistical methods; with the recent advancement of artificial intelligence, the machine learning and deep learning methods have become more popular. However, existing methods often fail to fully model the complex spatial dynamics under different scales, which ignore the dynamic multi-resolution spatial and temporal joint inter-dependencies. Moreover, they are less likely to consider the special baseline wander problem as well as the multi-view characteristics of medical time series, which largely hinders their prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, MedGNN, for medical time series classification. Specifically, we first propose to construct multi-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale embeddings. Then, to address the baseline wander problem, we propose Difference Attention Networks to operate self-attention mechanisms on the finite difference for temporal modeling. Moreover, to learn the multi-view characteristics, we utilize the Frequency Convolution Networks to capture complementary information of medical time series from the frequency domain. In addition, we introduce the Multi-resolution Graph Transformer architecture to model the dynamic dependencies and fuse the information from different resolutions. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple medical real-world datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our Code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Rashid, Ruotian Wu, Rongqi Fan, Hongliang Li, Agustinus Kristiadi, Pascal Poupart</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward-guided text generation (RGTG) has emerged as a viable alternative to offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RGTG methods can align baseline language models to human preferences without further training like in standard RLHF methods. However, they rely on a reward model to score each candidate token generated by the language model at inference, incurring significant test-time overhead. Additionally, the reward model is usually only trained to score full sequences, which can lead to sub-optimal choices for partial sequences. In this work, we present a novel reward model architecture that is trained, using a Bradley-Terry loss, to prefer the optimal expansion of a sequence with just a \emph{single call} to the reward model at each step of the generation process. That is, a score for all possible candidate tokens is generated simultaneously, leading to efficient inference. We theoretically analyze various RGTG reward models and demonstrate that prior techniques prefer sub-optimal sequences compared to our method during inference. Empirically, our reward model leads to significantly faster inference than other RGTG methods. It requires fewer calls to the reward model and performs competitively compared to previous RGTG and offline RLHF methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artughrul Gayibov (Baku Engineering University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient use of cultivated areas is a necessary factor for sustainable development of agriculture and ensuring food security. Along with the rapid development of satellite technologies in developed countries, new methods are being searched for accurate and operational identification of cultivated areas. In this context, identification of cropland boundaries based on spectral analysis of data obtained from satellite images is considered one of the most optimal and accurate methods in modern agriculture. This article proposes a new approach to determine the suitability and green index of cultivated areas using satellite data obtained through the "Google Earth Engine" (GEE) platform. In this approach, two powerful algorithms, "SNIC (Simple Non-Iterative Clustering) Super Pixels" and "Canny Edge Detection Method", are combined. The SNIC algorithm combines pixels in a satellite image into larger regions (super pixels) with similar characteristics, thereby providing better image analysis. The Canny Edge Detection Method detects sharp changes (edges) in the image to determine the precise boundaries of agricultural fields. This study, carried out using high-resolution multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API, has shown that the proposed method is effective in accurately and reliably classifying randomly selected agricultural fields. The combined use of these two tools allows for more accurate determination of the boundaries of agricultural fields by minimizing the effects of outliers in satellite images. As a result, more accurate and reliable maps can be created for agricultural monitoring and resource management over large areas based on the obtained data. By expanding the application capabilities of cloud-based platforms and artificial intelligence methods in the agricultural field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arwen Bradley, Preetum Nakkiran, David Berthelot, James Thornton, Joshua M. Susskind</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with a particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to "work". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. Finally, we connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04557">Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Approximate Verification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiyu Zhong, Noel Teku, Ravi Tandon</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing approximate sequential verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This leads to reducing the number of calls to the larger LLM and can achieve further speedups. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency. For instance, on Wiki-Summaries dataset, SPRINTER achieves a 1.7x latency speedup and requires 8.3x fewer flops relative to SD, while still generating high-quality responses when using GPT2-Small and GPT2-XL as draft/target models.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Fourier-based neural operators are best suited to learning mappings between functions on periodic domains, several works have introduced techniques for incorporating non trivial boundary conditions. However, all previously introduced methods have restrictions that limit their applicability. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to imposing boundary conditions inspired by volume penalization from numerical methods and Mixture of Experts (MoE) from machine learning. By introducing competing experts, the approach additionally allows for model selection. To demonstrate the method, we combine a spatially conditioned MoE with the Fourier based, Modal Operator Regression for Physics (MOR-Physics) neural operator and recover a nonlinear operator on a disk and quarter disk. Next, we extract a large eddy simulation (LES) model from direct numerical simulation of channel flow and show the domain decomposition provided by our approach. Finally, we train our LES model with Bayesian variational inference and obtain posterior predictive samples of flow far past the DNS simulation time horizon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging AI accelerators increasingly adopt wafer-scale manufacturing technologies, integrating hundreds of thousands of AI cores in a mesh-based architecture with large distributed on-chip memory (tens of GB in total) and ultra-high on-chip memory bandwidth (tens of PB/s). However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to fully exploit these accelerators. We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR device model that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators. Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves 200$\times$ better wafer-scale accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art systems. On a commodity wafer-scale accelerator, WaferLLM delivers 606$\times$ faster and 22$\times$ more energy-efficient GEMV compared to an advanced GPU. For LLMs, WaferLLM enables 39$\times$ faster decoding with 1.7$\times$ better energy efficiency. We anticipate these numbers will grow significantly as wafer-scale AI models, software, and hardware continue to mature.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an implementation of machine learning model training using private federated learning (PFL) on edge devices. We introduce a novel framework that uses PFL to address the challenge of training a model using users' private data. The framework ensures that user data remain on individual devices, with only essential model updates transmitted to a central server for aggregation with privacy guarantees. We detail the architecture of our app selection model, which incorporates a neural network with attention mechanisms and ambiguity handling through uncertainty management. Experiments conducted through off-line simulations and on device training demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios. Our results show the potential of PFL to improve the accuracy of an app selection model by adapting to changes in user behavior over time, while adhering to privacy standards. The insights gained from this study are important for industries looking to implement PFL, offering a robust strategy for training a predictive model directly on edge devices while ensuring user data privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Wyrwi\'nski, Krzysztof Krawiec</p>
<p>Abstract: Fitness landscapes in test-based program synthesis are known to be extremely rugged, with even minimal modifications of programs often leading to fundamental changes in their behavior and, consequently, fitness values. Relying on fitness as the only guidance in iterative search algorithms like genetic programming is thus unnecessarily limiting, especially when combined with purely syntactic search operators that are agnostic about their impact on program behavior. In this study, we propose a semantics-aware search operator that steers the search towards candidate programs that are valuable not only actually (high fitness) but also only potentially, i.e. are likely to be turned into high-quality solutions even if their current fitness is low. The key component of the method is a graph neural network that learns to model the interactions between program instructions and processed data, and produces a saliency map over graph nodes that represents possible search decisions. When applied to a suite of symbolic regression benchmarks, the proposed method outperforms conventional tree-based genetic programming and the ablated variant of the method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human intelligence involves metacognitive abilities like self-regulation, recognizing limitations, and seeking assistance only when needed. While LLM Agents excel in many domains, they often lack this awareness. Overconfident agents risk catastrophic failures, while those that seek help excessively hinder efficiency. A key challenge is enabling agents with a limited intervention budget $C$ is to decide when to request assistance. In this paper, we propose an offline framework that trains a "helper" policy to request interventions, such as more powerful models or test-time compute, by combining LLM-based process reward models (PRMs) with tabular reinforcement learning. Using state transitions collected offline, we score optimal intervention timing with PRMs and train the helper model on these labeled trajectories. This offline approach significantly reduces costly intervention calls during training. Furthermore, the integration of PRMs with tabular RL enhances robustness to off-policy data while avoiding the inefficiencies of deep RL. We empirically find that our method delivers optimal helper behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Haklay, Hadas Orgad, David Bau, Aaron Mueller, Yonatan Belinkov</p>
<p>Abstract: A widely used strategy to discover and understand language model mechanisms is circuit analysis. A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model's computation graph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit discovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model components as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across positions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics across examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with variable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline for schema generation and application using large language models. Our approach enables fully automated discovery of position-sensitive circuits, yielding better trade-offs between circuit size and faithfulness compared to prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, adapting to new tasks by simply conditioning on demonstrations without parameter updates. Compelling empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that ICL, as a general-purpose learner, could outperform task-specific models. However, it remains unclear to what extent the transformers optimally learn in-context compared to principled learning algorithms. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new framework for quantifying optimality of ICL as a learning algorithm in stylized settings. Our findings reveal a striking dichotomy: while ICL initially matches the efficiency of a Bayes optimal estimator, its efficiency significantly deteriorates in long context. Through an information-theoretic analysis, we show that the diminishing efficiency is inherent to ICL. These results clarify the trade-offs in adopting ICL as a universal problem solver, motivating a new generation of on-the-fly adaptive methods without the diminishing efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Jaewoong Choi, Dohyun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the convergence problem in learning the Optimal Transport (OT) map, where the OT Map refers to a map from one distribution to another while minimizing the transport cost. Semi-dual Neural OT, a widely used approach for learning OT Maps with neural networks, often generates fake solutions that fail to transfer one distribution to another accurately. We identify a sufficient condition under which the max-min solution of Semi-dual Neural OT recovers the true OT Map. Moreover, to address cases when this sufficient condition is not satisfied, we propose a novel method, OTP, which learns both the OT Map and the Optimal Transport Plan, representing the optimal coupling between two distributions. Under sharp assumptions on the distributions, we prove that our model eliminates the fake solution issue and correctly solves the OT problem. Our experiments show that the OTP model recovers the optimal transport map where existing methods fail and outperforms current OT-based models in image-to-image translation tasks. Notably, the OTP model can learn stochastic transport maps when deterministic OT Maps do not exist, such as one-to-many tasks like colorization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591">Rethinking Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks: A Rank-Based Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Deidda, Kaicheng Zhang, Desmond Higham, Francesco Tudisco</p>
<p>Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Wenbo Yang, Jun Wang, Qiang Ma, Jie Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Reza Rezaei, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Formento, Chuan Sheng Foo, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental issue in deep learning has been adversarial robustness. As these systems have scaled, such issues have persisted. Currently, large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial attacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat models have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings or output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been reasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no information about the model is available apart from the generated output. This means that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to detect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while having only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved through the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show that the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current LLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the likelihood of misclassification. Our new proposed paradigm demonstrates promising state-of-the-art results on three datasets across two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) when comparing our technique to existing hard-label black-box attack methods that introduce word-level substitutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heasung Kim, Taekyun Lee, Hyeji Kim, Gustavo de Veciana</p>
<p>Abstract: Importance sampling, which involves sampling from a probability density function (PDF) proportional to the product of an importance weight function and a base PDF, is a powerful technique with applications in variance reduction, biased or customized sampling, data augmentation, and beyond. Inspired by the growing availability of score-based generative models (SGMs), we propose an entirely training-free Importance sampling framework that relies solely on an SGM for the base PDF. Our key innovation is realizing the importance sampling process as a backward diffusion process, expressed in terms of the score function of the base PDF and the specified importance weight function--both readily available--eliminating the need for any additional training. We conduct a thorough analysis demonstrating the method's scalability and effectiveness across diverse datasets and tasks, including importance sampling for industrial and natural images with neural importance weight functions. The training-free aspect of our method is particularly compelling in real-world scenarios where a single base distribution underlies multiple biased sampling tasks, each requiring a different importance weight function. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first importance sampling framework to achieve this.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04662">Adversarially-Robust TD Learning with Markovian Data: Finite-Time Rates and Fundamental Limits</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sreejeet Maity, Aritra Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most basic problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is policy evaluation: estimating the long-term return, i.e., value function, corresponding to a given fixed policy. The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated finite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof. However, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always generated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution. Motivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption may no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the perspective of adversarial robustness. In particular, we consider a Huber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each reward sample with a small probability $\epsilon$. Under this observation model, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to converge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm called Robust-TD and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of vanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\epsilon)$ term that captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a minimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is unavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the context of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by Markov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results is an analysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated data that might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the optimization of overparameterized models, different gradient-based methods can achieve zero training error yet converge to distinctly different solutions inducing different generalization properties. While a decade of research on implicit optimization bias has illuminated this phenomenon in various settings, even the foundational case of linear classification with separable data still has important open questions. We resolve a fundamental gap by characterizing the implicit bias of both Adam and Sign Gradient Descent in multi-class cross-entropy minimization: we prove that their iterates converge to solutions that maximize the margin with respect to the classifier matrix's max-norm and characterize the rate of convergence. We extend our results to general p-norm normalized steepest descent algorithms and to other multi-class losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Yao, Ruifeng Ren, Yun Liao, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations has become a widely adopted strategy due to its significant enhancement of reasoning capabilities. To fully comprehend this approach, two questions naturally arise: (Q1) What advantages does training with CoT offer compared to training without CoT? (Q2) If there are advantages, what are the underlying mechanisms of explicit CoT training? Analyzing the advantages and mechanisms of CoT training is challenging due to the many factors involved. To address this, we conduct a detailed analysis using clear and controllable data distributions and, for the first time, reveal that CoT training offers the following advantages: (1) Training with CoT markedly improves reasoning generalization, extending it from in-distribution (ID) to both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, while also speeding up convergence; (2) Even when training with CoT includes a certain range of erroneous reasoning steps, it still enables the model to learn reasoning patterns, leading to systematic generalization. We further explore the underlying mechanisms from a circuit perspective: (1) The data distribution (e.g., ratio $\lambda$ and pattern) plays a crucial role in influencing the model's systematic generalization; (2) CoT training (with two-hop facts) internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying explicit CoT training and offer critical insights into tuning strategies for LLMs to achieve robust generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks, producing high-quality outputs across diverse domains. However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyuan Huang, Zengfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The cross-learning contextual bandit problem with graphical feedback has recently attracted significant attention. In this setting, there is a contextual bandit with a feedback graph over the arms, and pulling an arm reveals the loss for all neighboring arms in the feedback graph across all contexts. Initially proposed by Han et al. (2024), this problem has broad applications in areas such as bidding in first price auctions, and explores a novel frontier in the feedback structure of bandit problems. A key theoretical question is whether an algorithm with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret exists, where $\alpha$ represents the independence number of the feedback graph. This question is particularly interesting because it concerns whether an algorithm can achieve a regret bound entirely independent of the number of contexts and matching the minimax regret of vanilla graphical bandits. Previous work has demonstrated that such an algorithm is impossible for adversarial contexts, but the question remains open for stochastic contexts. In this work, we affirmatively answer this open question by presenting an algorithm that achieves the minimax $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret for cross-learning contextual bandits with graphical feedback and stochastic contexts. Notably, although that question is open even for stochastic bandits, we directly solve the strictly stronger adversarial bandit version of the problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discovering the genotype-phenotype relationship is crucial for genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances phenotype prediction accuracy across species, capturing subtle genetic variations that contribute to observable traits.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of the subspace - eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications, personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yang, Jingyuan Wang, Xiaohan Jiang, Junjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the perfect encounter of deep learning and quantitative trading has achieved great success in stock investment. Numerous deep learning-based models have been developed for forecasting stock returns, leveraging the powerful representation capabilities of neural networks to identify patterns and factors influencing stock prices. These models can effectively capture general patterns in the market, such as stock price trends, volume-price relationships, and time variations. However, the impact of special irrationality factors -- such as market sentiment, speculative behavior, market manipulation, and psychological biases -- have not been fully considered in existing deep stock forecasting models due to their relative abstraction as well as lack of explicit labels and data description. To fill this gap, we propose UMI, a Universal multi-level Market Irrationality factor model to enhance stock return forecasting. The UMI model learns factors that can reflect irrational behaviors in market from both individual stock and overall market levels. For the stock-level, UMI construct an estimated rational price for each stock, which is cointegrated with the stock's actual price. The discrepancy between the actual and the rational prices serves as a factor to indicate stock-level irrational events. Additionally, we define market-level irrational behaviors as anomalous synchronous fluctuations of stocks within a market. Using two self-supervised representation learning tasks, i.e., sub-market comparative learning and market synchronism prediction, the UMI model incorporates market-level irrationalities into a market representation vector, which is then used as the market-level irrationality factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant attention as a prominent privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) paradigm. Decentralized FL (DFL) eschews traditional FL's centralized server architecture, enhancing the system's robustness and scalability. However, these advantages of DFL also create new vulnerabilities for malicious participants to execute adversarial attacks, especially model poisoning attacks. In model poisoning attacks, malicious participants aim to diminish the performance of benign models by creating and disseminating the compromised model. Existing research on model poisoning attacks has predominantly concentrated on undermining global models within the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, while there needs to be more research in DFL. To fill the research gap, this paper proposes an innovative model poisoning attack called DMPA. This attack calculates the differential characteristics of multiple malicious client models and obtains the most effective poisoning strategy, thereby orchestrating a collusive attack by multiple participants. The effectiveness of this attack is validated across multiple datasets, with results indicating that the DMPA approach consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art FL model poisoning attack strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently emerged as a significant area of research. However, MARL evaluation often lacks systematic diversity, hindering a comprehensive understanding of algorithms' capabilities. In particular, cooperative MARL algorithms are predominantly evaluated on benchmarks such as SMAC and GRF, which primarily feature team game scenarios without assessing adequately various aspects of agents' capabilities required in fully cooperative real-world tasks such as multi-robot cooperation and warehouse, resource management, search and rescue, and human-AI cooperation. Moreover, MARL algorithms are mainly evaluated on low dimensional state spaces, and thus their performance on high-dimensional (e.g., image) observations is not well-studied. To fill this gap, this paper highlights the crucial need for expanding systematic evaluation across a wider array of existing benchmarks. To this end, we conduct extensive evaluation and comparisons of well-known MARL algorithms on complex fully cooperative benchmarks, including tasks with images as agents' observations. Interestingly, our analysis shows that many algorithms, hailed as state-of-the-art on SMAC and GRF, may underperform standard MARL baselines on fully cooperative benchmarks. Finally, towards more systematic and better evaluation of cooperative MARL algorithms, we have open-sourced PyMARLzoo+, an extension of the widely used (E)PyMARL libraries, which addresses an open challenge from [TBG++21], facilitating seamless integration and support with all benchmarks of PettingZoo, as well as Overcooked, PressurePlate, Capture Target and Box Pushing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Xiao Gao, Chenyang Wu, Mingjun Cao, Chenjun Xiao, Yang Yu, Zongzhang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary focus of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of out-of-distribution actions. An effective approach to achieve this goal is through behavior regularization, which augments conventional RL objectives by incorporating constraints that enforce the policy to remain close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern embodied artificial agents excel in static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously, exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We introduce the concept of co-existence for embodied artificial agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for meaningful, long-term interaction with humans. We take inspiration from biology and design theory to understand how human and non-human organisms foster entities that co-exist within their specific niches. Finally, we propose key research directions for the machine learning community to foster co-existing embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and learning methods responsible for shaping them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanna Komorniczak</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept drift is among the primary challenges faced by the data stream processing methods. The drift detection strategies, designed to counteract the negative consequences of such changes, often rely on analyzing the problem metafeatures. This work presents the Frequency Filtering Metadescriptor -- a tool for characterizing the data stream that searches for the informative frequency components visible in the sample's feature vector. The frequencies are filtered according to their variance across all available data batches. The presented solution is capable of generating a metadescription of the data stream, separating chunks into groups describing specific concepts on its basis, and visualizing the frequencies in the original spatial domain. The experimental analysis compared the proposed solution with two state-of-the-art strategies and with the PCA baseline in the post-hoc concept identification task. The research is followed by the identification of concepts in the real-world data streams. The generalization in the frequency domain adapted in the proposed solution allows to capture the complex feature dependencies as a reduced number of frequency components, while maintaining the semantic meaning of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Geert de Jong, Hirofumi Notsu, Kohei Nakajima</p>
<p>Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory behavior. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This reservoir computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. This work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedidya Kfir, Elad Sarafian, Sarit Kraus, Yoram Louzoun</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box algorithms are designed to optimize functions without relying on their underlying analytical structure or gradient information, making them essential when gradients are inaccessible or difficult to compute. Traditional methods for solving black-box optimization (BBO) problems predominantly rely on non-parametric models and struggle to scale to large input spaces. Conversely, parametric methods that model the function with neural estimators and obtain gradient signals via backpropagation may suffer from significant gradient errors. A recent alternative, Explicit Gradient Learning (EGL), which directly learns the gradient using a first-order Taylor approximation, has demonstrated superior performance over both parametric and non-parametric methods. In this work, we propose two novel gradient learning variants to address the robustness challenges posed by high-dimensional, complex, and highly non-linear problems. Optimistic Gradient Learning (OGL) introduces a bias toward lower regions in the function landscape, while Higher-order Gradient Learning (HGL) incorporates second-order Taylor corrections to improve gradient accuracy. We combine these approaches into the unified OHGL algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the synthetic COCO suite. Additionally, we demonstrate OHGLs applicability to high-dimensional real-world machine learning (ML) tasks such as adversarial training and code generation. Our results highlight OHGLs ability to generate stronger candidates, offering a valuable tool for ML researchers and practitioners tackling high-dimensional, non-linear optimization challenges</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Ballarin, Lyudmila Grigoryeva, Juan-Pablo Ortega</p>
<p>Abstract: The total memory capacity (MC) of linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been proven to be equal to the rank of the corresponding Kalman controllability matrix, and it is almost surely maximal for connectivity and input weight matrices drawn from regular distributions. This fact questions the usefulness of this metric in distinguishing the performance of linear RNNs in the processing of stochastic signals. This note shows that the MC of random nonlinear RNNs yields arbitrary values within established upper and lower bounds depending just on the input process scale. This confirms that the existing definition of MC in linear and nonlinear cases has no practical value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurbek Tastan, Samuel Horvath, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative learning enables multiple participants to learn a single global model by exchanging focused updates instead of sharing data. One of the core challenges in collaborative learning is ensuring that participants are rewarded fairly for their contributions, which entails two key sub-problems: contribution assessment and reward allocation. This work focuses on fair reward allocation, where the participants are incentivized through model rewards - differentiated final models whose performance is commensurate with the contribution. In this work, we leverage the concept of slimmable neural networks to collaboratively learn a shared global model whose performance degrades gracefully with a reduction in model width. We also propose a post-training fair allocation algorithm that determines the model width for each participant based on their contributions. We theoretically study the convergence of our proposed approach and empirically validate it using extensive experiments on different datasets and architectures. We also extend our approach to enable training-time model reward allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Leask, Bart Bussmann, Michael Pearce, Joseph Bloom, Curt Tigges, Noura Al Moubayed, Lee Sharkey, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: A common goal of mechanistic interpretability is to decompose the activations of neural networks into features: interpretable properties of the input computed by the model. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for finding these features in LLMs, and it has been postulated that they can be used to find a \textit{canonical} set of units: a unique and complete list of atomic features. We cast doubt on this belief using two novel techniques: SAE stitching to show they are incomplete, and meta-SAEs to show they are not atomic. SAE stitching involves inserting or swapping latents from a larger SAE into a smaller one. Latents from the larger SAE can be divided into two categories: \emph{novel latents}, which improve performance when added to the smaller SAE, indicating they capture novel information, and \emph{reconstruction latents}, which can replace corresponding latents in the smaller SAE that have similar behavior. The existence of novel features indicates incompleteness of smaller SAEs. Using meta-SAEs -- SAEs trained on the decoder matrix of another SAE -- we find that latents in SAEs often decompose into combinations of latents from a smaller SAE, showing that larger SAE latents are not atomic. The resulting decompositions are often interpretable; e.g. a latent representing ``Einstein'' decomposes into ``scientist'', ``Germany'', and ``famous person''. Even if SAEs do not find canonical units of analysis, they may still be useful tools. We suggest that future research should either pursue different approaches for identifying such units, or pragmatically choose the SAE size suited to their task. We provide an interactive dashboard to explore meta-SAEs: https://metasaes.streamlit.app/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Liu, Chen Chen, Lingjuan Lyu, Yaochu Jin, Gang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is notorious for its vulnerability to Byzantine attacks. Most current Byzantine defenses share a common inductive bias: among all the gradients, the densely distributed ones are more likely to be honest. However, such a bias is a poison to Byzantine robustness due to a newly discovered phenomenon in this paper - gradient skew. We discover that a group of densely distributed honest gradients skew away from the optimal gradient (the average of honest gradients) due to heterogeneous data. This gradient skew phenomenon allows Byzantine gradients to hide within the densely distributed skewed gradients. As a result, Byzantine defenses are confused into believing that Byzantine gradients are honest. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel skew-aware attack called STRIKE: first, we search for the skewed gradients; then, we construct Byzantine gradients within the skewed gradients. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our attack</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Celia Rubio-Madrigal, Adarsh Jamadandi, Rebekka Burkholz</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximizing the spectral gap through graph rewiring has been proposed to enhance the performance of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) by addressing over-squashing. However, as we show, minimizing the spectral gap can also improve generalization. To explain this, we analyze how rewiring can benefit GNNs within the context of stochastic block models. Since spectral gap optimization primarily influences community strength, it improves performance when the community structure aligns with node labels. Building on this insight, we propose three distinct rewiring strategies that explicitly target community structure, node labels, and their alignment: (a) community structure-based rewiring (ComMa), a more computationally efficient alternative to spectral gap optimization that achieves similar goals; (b) feature similarity-based rewiring (FeaSt), which focuses on maximizing global homophily; and (c) a hybrid approach (ComFy), which enhances local feature similarity while preserving community structure to optimize label-community alignment. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of these strategies and support our theoretical insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonhyeong Park, Byoungwoo Park, Chang-Bae Bang, Jungwon Choi, Hyungjin Chung, Byung-Hoon Kim, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a foundational model for brain dynamics that utilizes stochastic optimal control (SOC) and amortized inference. Our method features a continuous-discrete state space model (SSM) that can robustly handle the intricate and noisy nature of fMRI signals. To address computational limitations, we implement an approximation strategy grounded in the SOC framework. Additionally, we present a simulation-free latent dynamics approach that employs locally linear approximations, facilitating efficient and scalable inference. For effective representation learning, we derive an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) from the SOC formulation, which integrates smoothly with recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), thereby promoting robust and transferable representations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets such as the UKB, our model attains state-of-the-art results across a variety of downstream tasks, including demographic prediction, trait analysis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis. Moreover, evaluating on external datasets such as HCP-A, ABIDE, and ADHD200 further validates its superior abilities and resilience across different demographic and clinical distributions. Our foundational model provides a scalable and efficient approach for deciphering brain dynamics, opening up numerous applications in neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nunzio A. Letizia</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased availability of data and computing resources has enabled researchers to successfully adopt machine learning (ML) techniques and make significant contributions in several engineering areas. ML and in particular deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown to perform better in tasks where a physical bottom-up description of the phenomenon is lacking and/or is mathematically intractable. Indeed, they take advantage of the observations of natural phenomena to automatically acquire knowledge and learn internal relations. Despite the historical model-based mindset, communications engineering recently started shifting the focus towards top-down data-driven learning models, especially in domains such as channel modeling and physical layer design, where in most of the cases no general optimal strategies are known.
  In this thesis, we aim at solving some fundamental open challenges in physical layer communications exploiting new DL paradigms. In particular, we mathematically formulate, under ML terms, classic problems such as channel capacity and optimal coding-decoding schemes, for any arbitrary communication medium. We design and develop the architecture, algorithm and code necessary to train the equivalent DL model, and finally, we propose novel solutions to long-standing problems in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Levente Z\'olyomi, Tianze Wang, Sofiane Ennadir, Oleg Smirnov, Lele Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of digital interactions across diverse domains, such as healthcare, e-commerce, gaming, and finance, has resulted in the generation of vast volumes of event stream (ES) data. ES data comprises continuous sequences of timestamped events that encapsulate detailed contextual information relevant to each domain. While ES data holds significant potential for extracting actionable insights and enhancing decision-making, its effective utilization is hindered by challenges such as the scarcity of labeled data and the fragmented nature of existing research efforts. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by enabling the extraction of meaningful representations from unlabeled ES data. In this survey, we systematically review and synthesize SSL methodologies tailored for ES modeling across multiple domains, bridging the gaps between domain-specific approaches that have traditionally operated in isolation. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of SSL techniques, encompassing both predictive and contrastive paradigms, and analyze their applicability and effectiveness within different application contexts. Furthermore, we identify critical gaps in current research and propose a future research agenda aimed at developing scalable, domain-agnostic SSL frameworks for ES modeling. By unifying disparate research efforts and highlighting cross-domain synergies, this survey aims to accelerate innovation, improve reproducibility, and expand the applicability of SSL to diverse real-world ES challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Cornell, Oleg Smirnov, Gabriela Zarzar Gandler, Lele Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graph datasets often exhibit strong temporal patterns, such as recency, which prioritizes recent interactions, and popularity, which favors frequently occurring nodes. We demonstrate that simple heuristics leveraging only these patterns can perform on par or outperform state-of-the-art neural network models under standard evaluation protocols. To further explore these dynamics, we introduce metrics that quantify the impact of recency and popularity across datasets. Our experiments on BenchTemp and the Temporal Graph Benchmark show that our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance across all datasets in the latter and secure top ranks on multiple datasets in the former. These results emphasize the importance of refined evaluation schemes to enable fair comparisons and promote the development of more robust temporal graph models. Additionally, they reveal that current deep learning methods often struggle to capture the key patterns underlying predictions in real-world temporal graphs. For reproducibility, we have made our code publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into electricity markets poses significant challenges to price stability and increases the complexity of market operations. Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting is crucial for effective market participation, where price dynamics can be significantly more challenging to predict. Probabilistic forecasting, through prediction intervals, efficiently quantifies the inherent uncertainties in electricity prices, supporting better decision-making for market participants. This study explores the enhancement of probabilistic price prediction using Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, specifically Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals and Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference. These methods provide precise and reliable prediction intervals, outperforming traditional models in validity metrics. We propose an ensemble approach that combines the efficiency of quantile regression models with the robust coverage properties of time series adapted CP techniques. This ensemble delivers both narrow prediction intervals and high coverage, leading to more reliable and accurate forecasts. We further evaluate the practical implications of CP techniques through a simulated trading algorithm applied to a battery storage system. The ensemble approach demonstrates improved financial returns in energy trading in both the Day-Ahead and Balancing Markets, highlighting its practical benefits for market participants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model merging integrates the weights of multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model. Despite recent interest in the problem, a significant performance gap between the combined and single-task models remains. In this paper, we investigate the key characteristics of task matrices -- weight update matrices applied to a pre-trained model -- that enable effective merging. We show that alignment between singular components of task-specific and merged matrices strongly correlates with performance improvement over the pre-trained model. Based on this, we propose an isotropic merging framework that flattens the singular value spectrum of task matrices, enhances alignment, and reduces the performance gap. Additionally, we incorporate both common and task-specific subspaces to further improve alignment and performance. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple scenarios, including various sets of tasks and model scales. This work advances the understanding of model merging dynamics, offering an effective methodology to merge models without requiring additional training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianshu Zhang, Xiaofu Wu, Junquan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the anti-jamming channel access problem in complex and unknown jamming environments, where the jammer could dynamically adjust its strategies to target different channels. Traditional channel hopping anti-jamming approaches using fixed patterns are ineffective against such dynamic jamming attacks. Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium under fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes. To address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access approach guided by the intuition of ``learning faster than the jammer", where a synchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary task for the deep Q learning (DQN) based anti-jamming model. This helps the model identify a superior Q-function compared to standard DRL while significantly reducing the number of training episodes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the rate of convergence in model training, reducing the required training episodes by up to 70% compared to standard DRL. Additionally, it also achieves a 10% improvement in throughput over NE strategies, owing to the effective use of coarse-grained spectrum prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amro Abu Saleh, Elliot Sprecher, Kfir Y. Levy, Daniel H. Lange</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based biometrics offer a promising method for user identification, combining intrinsic liveness detection with morphological uniqueness. However, elevated heart rates introduce significant physiological variability, posing challenges to pattern recognition systems and leading to a notable performance gap between resting and post-exercise conditions. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing ECG-based biometric systems for real-world applications. We propose DE-PADA, a Dual Expert model with Personalized Augmentation and Domain Adaptation, designed to enhance robustness across diverse physiological states. The model is trained primarily on resting-state data from the evaluation dataset, without direct exposure to their exercise data. To address variability, DE-PADA incorporates ECG-specific innovations, including heartbeat segmentation into the PQRS interval, known for its relative temporal consistency, and the heart rate-sensitive ST interval, enabling targeted feature extraction tailored to each region's unique characteristics. Personalized augmentation simulates subject-specific T-wave variability across heart rates using individual T-wave peak predictions to adapt augmentation ranges. Domain adaptation further improves generalization by leveraging auxiliary data from supplementary subjects used exclusively for training, including both resting and exercise conditions. Experiments on the University of Toronto ECG Database demonstrate the model's effectiveness. DE-PADA achieves relative improvements in post-exercise identification rates of 26.75% in the initial recovery phase and 11.72% in the late recovery phase, while maintaining a 98.12% identification rate in the sitting position. These results highlight DE-PADA's ability to address intra-subject variability and enhance the robustness of ECG-based biometric systems across diverse physiological states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Rietz, Oleg Smirnov, Sara Karimi, Lele Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Harnessing large offline datasets is vital for training foundation models that can generalize across diverse tasks. Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for these scenarios, enabling the derivation of optimal policies even from suboptimal data. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) is an offline RL multi-task model that distinguishes tasks through stochastic trajectory prompts, which are task-specific tokens maintained in context during rollouts. However, PDT samples these tokens uniformly at random from per-task demonstration datasets, failing to account for differences in token informativeness and potentially leading to performance degradation. To address this limitation, we introduce a scalable bandit-based prompt-tuning method that dynamically learns to construct high-performance trajectory prompts. Our approach significantly enhances downstream task performance without modifying the pre-trained Transformer backbone. Empirical results on benchmark tasks and a newly designed multi-task environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, creating a seamless bridge between general multi-task offline pre-training and task-specific online adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial evasion attacks pose significant threats to graph learning, with lines of studies that have improved the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking strategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph learning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we investigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification framework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model to learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed structures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured predictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the forward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which structure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during the forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism to selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment between the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse process, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer entropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Panferov, Jiale Chen, Soroush Tabesh, Roberto L. Castro, Mahdi Nikdan, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330v2) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations.
  We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST.</p>

<p>Abstract: We apply language modeling techniques to detect ransomware activity in NVMe command sequences. We design and train two types of transformer-based models: the Command-Level Transformer (CLT) performs in-context token classification to determine whether individual commands are initiated by ransomware, and the Patch-Level Transformer (PLT) predicts the volume of data accessed by ransomware within a patch of commands. We present both model designs and the corresponding tokenization and embedding schemes and show that they improve over state-of-the-art tabular methods by up to 24% in missed-detection rate, 66% in data loss prevention, and 84% in identifying data accessed by ransomware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan K. Schuler, Chinthan Prasad, Georgiy Kiselev, Donald Sofge</p>
<p>Abstract: Station-Keeping short-duration high-altitude balloons (HABs) in a region of interest is a challenging path-planning problem due to partially observable, complex, and dynamic wind flows. Deep reinforcement learning is a popular strategy for solving the station-keeping problem. A custom simulation environment was developed to train and evaluate Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for short-duration HAB agents in the simulation. To train the agents on realistic winds, synthetic wind forecasts were generated from aggregated historical radiosonde data to apply horizontal kinematics to simulated agents. The synthetic forecasts were closely correlated with ECWMF ERA5 Reanalysis forecasts, providing a realistic simulated wind field and seasonal and altitudinal variances between the wind models. DQN HAB agents were then trained and evaluated across different seasonal months. To highlight differences and trends in months with vastly different wind fields, a Forecast Score algorithm was introduced to independently classify forecasts based on wind diversity, and trends between station-keeping success and the Forecast Score were evaluated across all seasons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Vaze, Abhishek Sinha</p>
<p>Abstract: The constrained version of the standard online convex optimization (OCO) framework, called COCO is considered, where on every round, a convex cost function and a convex constraint function are revealed to the learner after it chooses the action for that round. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the static regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV). An algorithm is proposed that guarantees a static regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$ and a CCV of $\min\{\cV, O(\sqrt{T}\log T) \}$, where $\cV$ depends on the distance between the consecutively revealed constraint sets, the shape of constraint sets, dimension of action space and the diameter of the action space. For special cases of constraint sets, $\cV=O(1)$. Compared to the state of the art results, static regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$ and CCV of $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, that were universal, the new result on CCV is instance dependent, which is derived by exploiting the geometric properties of the constraint sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramy Harik, Fadi El Kalach, Jad Samaha, Philip Samaha, Devon Clark, Drew Sander, Liam Burns, Ibrahim Yousif, Victor Gadow, Ahmed Mahmoud, Thorsten Wuest</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents two industry-grade datasets captured during an 8-hour continuous operation of the manufacturing assembly line at the Future Factories Lab, University of South Carolina, on 08/13/2024. The datasets adhere to industry standards, covering communication protocols, actuators, control mechanisms, transducers, sensors, and cameras. Data collection utilized both integrated and external sensors throughout the laboratory, including sensors embedded within the actuators and externally installed devices. Additionally, high-performance cameras captured key aspects of the operation. In a prior experiment [1], a 30-hour continuous run was conducted, during which all anomalies were documented. Maintenance procedures were subsequently implemented to reduce potential errors and operational disruptions. The two datasets include: (1) a time-series analog dataset, and (2) a multi-modal time-series dataset containing synchronized system data and images. These datasets aim to support future research in advancing manufacturing processes by providing a platform for testing novel algorithms without the need to recreate physical manufacturing environments. Moreover, the datasets are open-source and designed to facilitate the training of artificial intelligence models, streamlining research by offering comprehensive, ready-to-use resources for various applications and projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sujit Mandava, Deepak P, Sahely Bhadra</p>
<p>Abstract: While there has been much research into developing AI techniques for fake news detection aided by various benchmark datasets, it has often been pointed out that fake news in different geo-political regions traces different contours. In this work we uncover, through analytical arguments and empirical evidence, the existence of an important characteristic in news originating from the Global South viz., the geo-political veracity gradient. In particular, we show that Global South news about topics from Global North -- such as news from an Indian news agency on US elections -- tend to be less likely to be fake. Observing through the prism of the political economy of fake news creation, we posit that this pattern could be due to the relative lack of monetarily aligned incentives in producing fake news about a different region than the regional remit of the audience. We provide empirical evidence for this from benchmark datasets. We also empirically analyze the consequences of this effect in applying AI-based fake news detection models for fake news AI trained on one region within another regional context. We locate our work within emerging critical scholarship on geo-political biases within AI in general, particularly with AI usage in fake news identification; we hope our insight into the geo-political veracity gradient could help steer fake news AI scholarship towards positively impacting Global South societies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokesh Nagalapatti, Pranava Singhal, Avishek Ghosh, Sunita Sarawagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Treatment effect estimation involves assessing the impact of different treatments on individual outcomes. Current methods estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using observational datasets where covariates are collected before treatment assignment and outcomes are observed afterward, under assumptions like positivity and unconfoundedness. In this paper, we address a scenario where both covariates and outcomes are gathered after treatment. We show that post-treatment covariates render CATE unidentifiable, and recovering CATE requires learning treatment-independent causal representations. Prior work shows that such representations can be learned through contrastive learning if counterfactual supervision is available in observational data. However, since counterfactuals are rare, other works have explored using simulators that offer synthetic counterfactual supervision. Our goal in this paper is to systematically analyze the role of simulators in estimating CATE. We analyze the CATE error of several baselines and highlight their limitations. We then establish a generalization bound that characterizes the CATE error from jointly training on real and simulated distributions, as a function of the real-simulator mismatch. Finally, we introduce SimPONet, a novel method whose loss function is inspired from our generalization bound. We further show how SimPONet adjusts the simulator's influence on the learning objective based on the simulator's relevance to the CATE task. We experiment with various DGPs, by systematically varying the real-simulator distribution gap to evaluate SimPONet's efficacy against state-of-the-art CATE baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohannis Kifle Telila, Damitha Senevirathne, Dumindu Tissera, Apurva Narayan, Miriam A. M. Capretz, Katarina Grolinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in the energy sector to identify irregular patterns indicating equipment failures, energy theft, or other issues. Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Korolev, Tim Schmidt, Dinesh K. Natarajan, Stefano Cassola, David May, Miro Duhovic, Michael Hinterm\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid machine learning-based scale-bridging framework for predicting the permeability of fibrous textile structures. By addressing the computational challenges inherent to multiscale modeling, the proposed approach evaluates the efficiency and accuracy of different scale-bridging methodologies combining traditional surrogate models and even integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with numerical solvers, enabling accurate permeability predictions across micro- and mesoscales. Four methodologies were evaluated: Single Scale Method (SSM), Simple Upscaling Method (SUM), Scale-Bridging Method (SBM), and Fully Resolved Model (FRM). SSM, the simplest method, neglects microscale permeability and exhibited permeability values deviating by up to 150\% of the FRM model, which was taken as ground truth at an equivalent lower fiber volume content. SUM improved predictions by considering uniform microscale permeability, yielding closer values under similar conditions, but still lacked structural variability. The SBM method, incorporating segment-based microscale permeability assignments, showed significant enhancements, achieving almost equivalent values while maintaining computational efficiency and modeling runtimes of ~45 minutes per simulation. In contrast, FRM, which provides the highest fidelity by fully resolving microscale and mesoscale geometries, required up to 270 times more computational time than SSM, with model files exceeding 300 GB. Additionally, a hybrid dual-scale solver incorporating PINNs has been developed and shows the potential to overcome generalization errors and the problem of data scarcity of the data-driven surrogate approaches. The hybrid framework advances permeability modelling by balancing computational cost and prediction reliability, laying the foundation for further applications in fibrous composite manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgina Nouli, Axel Parmentier, Maximilian Schiffer</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourced on-demand services offer benefits such as reduced costs, faster service fulfillment times, greater adaptability, and contributions to sustainable urban transportation in on-demand delivery contexts. However, the success of an on-demand platform that utilizes crowdsourcing relies on finding a compensation policy that strikes a balance between creating attractive offers for gig workers and ensuring profitability. In this work, we examine a dynamic pricing problem for an on-demand platform that sets request-specific compensation of gig workers in a discrete-time framework, where requests and workers arrive stochastically. The operator's goal is to determine a compensation policy that maximizes the total expected reward over the time horizon. Our approach introduces compensation strategies that explicitly account for gig worker request preferences. To achieve this, we employ the Multinomial Logit model to represent the acceptance probabilities of gig workers, and, as a result, derive an analytical solution that utilizes post-decision states. Subsequently, we integrate this solution into an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We compare our algorithm against benchmark algorithms, including formula-based policies and an upper bound provided by the full information linear programming solution. Our algorithm demonstrates consistent performance across diverse settings, achieving improvements of at least 2.5-7.5% in homogeneous gig worker populations and 9% in heterogeneous populations over benchmarks, based on fully synthetic data. For real-world data, it surpasses benchmarks by 8% in weak and 20% in strong location preference scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05075">Discrepancies are Virtue: Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Lens of Intrinsic Dimension</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Dong, Yicheng Li, Yunai Li, Jason D. Lee, Qi Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported with experiments on both synthetic regression problems and real vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Ze Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ability of single-layer attention-only transformers (i.e. attention layers) to memorize facts contained in databases from a linear-algebraic perspective. We associate with each database a 3-tensor, propose the rank of this tensor as a measure of the size of the database, and provide bounds on the rank in terms of properties of the database. We also define a 3-tensor corresponding to an attention layer, and empirically demonstrate the relationship between its rank and database rank on a dataset of toy models and random databases. By highlighting the roles played by the value-output and query-key weights, and the effects of argmax and softmax on rank, our results shed light on the `additive motif' of factual recall in transformers, while also suggesting a way of increasing layer capacity without increasing the number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Leeb, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective and reliable evaluation is essential for advancing empirical machine learning. However, the increasing accessibility of generalist models and the progress towards ever more complex, high-level tasks make systematic evaluation more challenging. Benchmarks are plagued by various biases, artifacts, or leakage, while models may behave unreliably due to poorly explored failure modes. Haphazard treatments and inconsistent formulations of such "monsters" can contribute to a duplication of efforts, a lack of trust in results, and unsupported inferences. In this position paper, we argue causality offers an ideal framework to systematically address these challenges. By making causal assumptions in an approach explicit, we can faithfully model phenomena, formulate testable hypotheses with explanatory power, and leverage principled tools for analysis. To make causal model design more accessible, we identify several useful Common Abstract Topologies (CATs) in causal graphs which help gain insight into the reasoning abilities in large language models. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how the precise yet pragmatic language of causality clarifies the strengths and limitations of a method and inspires new approaches for systematic progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thierry Bossy, Julien Vignoud, Tahseen Rabbani, Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, Martin Jaggi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative training which avoids direct data exposure between clients. However, data privacy issues still remain: FL-trained large language models are capable of memorizing and completing phrases and sentences contained in training data when given with their prefixes. Thus, it is possible for adversarial and honest-but-curious clients to recover training data of other participants simply through targeted prompting. In this work, we demonstrate that a popular and simple fine-tuning strategy, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), reduces memorization during FL up to a factor of 10. We study this effect by performing a medical question-answering fine-tuning task and injecting multiple replicas of out-of-distribution sensitive sequences drawn from an external clinical dataset. We observe a reduction in memorization for a wide variety of Llama 2 and 3 models, and find that LoRA can reduce memorization in centralized learning as well. Furthermore, we show that LoRA can be combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as gradient clipping and Gaussian noising, secure aggregation, and Goldfish loss to further improve record-level privacy while maintaining performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Umair Danish, Katarina Grolinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Consumer energy forecasting is essential for managing energy consumption and planning, directly influencing operational efficiency, cost reduction, personalized energy management, and sustainability efforts. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially LSTMs and transformers, have been greatly successful in the field of energy consumption forecasting. Nevertheless, these techniques have difficulties in capturing complex and sudden variations, and, moreover, they are commonly examined only on a specific type of consumer (e.g., only offices, only schools). Consequently, this paper proposes HyperEnergy, a consumer energy forecasting strategy that leverages hypernetworks for improved modeling of complex patterns applicable across a diversity of consumers. Hypernetwork is responsible for predicting the parameters of the primary prediction network, in our case LSTM. A learnable adaptable kernel, comprised of polynomial and radial basis function kernels, is incorporated to enhance performance. The proposed HyperEnergy was evaluated on diverse consumers including, student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, and a townhouse. Across all consumer types, HyperEnergy consistently outperformed 10 other techniques, including state-of-the-art models such as LSTM, AttentionLSTM, and transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mart\'in Schmidt, Sara Silva, Federico Larroca, Gonzalo Mateos, Pablo Mus\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compound identification and structure annotation from mass spectra is a well-established task widely applied in drug detection, criminal forensics, small molecule biomarker discovery and chemical engineering.
  We propose SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures, a deep neural model that addresses the task of structural annotation of small molecules from low-resolution gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectra (GC-EI-MS). Our model analyzes the spectra in \textit{de novo} manner -- a direct translation from the spectra into 2D-structural representation. Our approach is particularly useful for analyzing compounds unavailable in spectral libraries.
  In a rigorous evaluation of our model on the novel structure annotation task across different libraries, we outperformed standard database search techniques by a wide margin. On a held-out testing set, including \numprint{28267} spectra from the NIST database, we show that our model's single suggestion perfectly reconstructs 43\% of the subset's compounds. This single suggestion is strictly better than the candidate of the database hybrid search (common method among practitioners)
  in 76\% of cases. In a~still affordable scenario of~10 suggestions, perfect reconstruction is achieved in 65\%, and 84\% are better than the hybrid search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parallel training methods are increasingly relevant in machine learning (ML) due to the continuing growth in model and dataset sizes. We propose a variant of the Additively Preconditioned Trust-Region Strategy (APTS) for training deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed APTS method utilizes a data-parallel approach to construct a nonlinear preconditioner employed in the nonlinear optimization strategy. In contrast to the common employment of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), which are both variants of gradient descent (GD) algorithms, the APTS method implicitly adjusts the step sizes in each iteration, thereby removing the need for costly hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed APTS variant using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results obtained indicate that the APTS variant proposed here achieves comparable validation accuracy to SGD and Adam, all while allowing for parallel training and obviating the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Xu, Ivan Nazarov, Aditya Rastogi, \'Africa Peri\'a\~nez, Kyra Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Online restless bandits extend classic contextual bandits by incorporating state transitions and budget constraints, representing each agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework is crucial for finite-horizon strategic resource allocation, optimizing limited costly interventions for long-term benefits. However, learning the underlying MDP for each agent poses a major challenge in finite-horizon settings. To facilitate learning, we reformulate the problem as a scalable budgeted thresholding contextual bandit problem, carefully integrating the state transitions into the reward design and focusing on identifying agents with action benefits exceeding a threshold. We establish the optimality of an oracle greedy solution in a simple two-state setting, and propose an algorithm that achieves minimax optimal constant regret in the online multi-state setting with heterogeneous agents and knowledge of outcomes under no intervention. We numerically show that our algorithm outperforms existing online restless bandit methods, offering significant improvements in finite-horizon performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqin Tang, Shujian Yu, Yining Dong, S. Joe Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Deep Dynamic Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (D2PCCA), a model that integrates deep learning with probabilistic modeling to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems. Building on the probabilistic extensions of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), D2PCCA captures nonlinear latent dynamics and supports enhancements such as KL annealing for improved convergence and normalizing flows for a more flexible posterior approximation. D2PCCA naturally extends to multiple observed variables, making it a versatile tool for encoding prior knowledge about sequential datasets and providing a probabilistic understanding of the system's dynamics. Experimental validation on real financial datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of D2PCCA and its extensions in capturing latent dynamics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05157">Efficient distributional regression trees learning algorithms for calibrated non-parametric probabilistic forecasts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duchemin Quentin, Obozinski Guillaume</p>
<p>Abstract: The perspective of developing trustworthy AI for critical applications in science and engineering requires machine learning techniques that are capable of estimating their own uncertainty. In the context of regression, instead of estimating a conditional mean, this can be achieved by producing a predictive interval for the output, or to even learn a model of the conditional probability $p(y|x)$ of an output $y$ given input features $x$. While this can be done under parametric assumptions with, e.g. generalized linear model, these are typically too strong, and non-parametric models offer flexible alternatives. In particular, for scalar outputs, learning directly a model of the conditional cumulative distribution function of $y$ given $x$ can lead to more precise probabilistic estimates, and the use of proper scoring rules such as the weighted interval score (WIS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) lead to better coverage and calibration properties.
  This paper introduces novel algorithms for learning probabilistic regression trees for the WIS or CRPS loss functions. These algorithms are made computationally efficient thanks to an appropriate use of known data structures - namely min-max heaps, weight-balanced binary trees and Fenwick trees. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of our methods is competitive with alternative approaches. Additionally, our methods benefit from the inherent interpretability and explainability of trees. As a by-product, we show how our trees can be used in the context of conformal prediction and explain why they are particularly well-suited for achieving group-conditional coverage guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parjanya Prajakta Prashant, Kaustubh Ponkshe, Babak Salimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across many tasks yet risk reproducing copyrighted content verbatim, raising legal and ethical concerns. Although methods like differential privacy or neuron editing can reduce memorization, they typically require costly retraining or direct access to model weights and may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc approach that replaces the probabilities of grammar-related tokens with those from a small auxiliary model (e.g., DistilGPT-2). We run extensive experiments on commercial grade models such as Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b and demonstrate that our method effectively reduces well-known cases of memorized generation by upto 10x with little to no impact on downstream tasks. Our approach offers a uniquely accessible and effective solution to users of real-world systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Smart, Alberto Bietti, Anirvan M. Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Geiping, Sean McLeish, Neel Jain, John Kirchenbauer, Siddharth Singh, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Abhinav Bhatele, Tom Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a novel language model architecture that is capable of scaling test-time computation by implicitly reasoning in latent space. Our model works by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought, our approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily represented in words. We scale a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion parameters and 800 billion tokens. We show that the resulting model can improve its performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a computation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly increased computational efficiency in both research and real-world applications of large-scale machine learning models. However, their scalability and efficiency under memory constraints remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we present joint scaling laws for dense and MoE models, incorporating key factors such as the number of active parameters, dataset size, and the number of experts. Our findings provide a principled framework for selecting the optimal MoE configuration under fixed memory and compute budgets. Surprisingly, we show that MoE models can be more memory-efficient than dense models, contradicting conventional wisdom. To derive and validate the theoretical predictions of our scaling laws, we conduct over 280 experiments with up to 2.7B active parameters and up to 5B total parameters. These results offer actionable insights for designing and deploying MoE models in practical large-scale training scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emy Priem, Youssef Diouane, Nathalie Bartoli, Sylvain Dubreuil, Paul Saves</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is one of the most powerful strategies to solve computationally expensive-to-evaluate blackbox optimization problems. However, BO methods are conventionally used for optimization problems of small dimension because of the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, a high-dimensionnal optimization method incorporating linear embedding subspaces of small dimension is proposed to efficiently perform the optimization. An adaptive learning strategy for these linear embeddings is carried out in conjunction with the optimization. The resulting BO method, named efficient global optimization coupled with random and supervised embedding (EGORSE), combines in an adaptive way both random and supervised linear embeddings. EGORSE has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and tested on academic examples with a number of design variables ranging from 10 to 600. The obtained results show the high potential of EGORSE to solve high-dimensional blackbox optimization problems, in terms of both CPU time and the limited number of calls to the expensive blackbox simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyuan Zhang, Oswin So, Mitchell Black, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze the time reversed dynamics of generative diffusion models. If the exact empirical score function is used in a regime of large dimension and exponentially large number of samples, these models are known to undergo transitions between distinct dynamical regimes. We extend this analysis and compute the transitions for an analytically tractable manifold model where the statistical model for the data is a mixture of lower dimensional Gaussians embedded in higher dimensional space. We compute the so-called speciation and collapse transition times, as a function of the ratio of manifold-to-ambient space dimensions, and other characteristics of the data model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehan Yan, Tianhao Ma, Ruotai Li, Xinhan Zheng, Guodong Shan, Chisheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a vital role in health protection and disease treatment, but its practical application requires extensive medical knowledge and clinical experience. Existing TCM Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit critical limitations of uncomprehensive medical consultation and diagnoses, and inaccurate syndrome differentiation-based treatment. To address these issues, this study establishes JingFang (JF): a novel TCM Large Language Model that demonstrates the expert-level capability of medical diagnosis and syndrome differentiation-based treatment. We innovate a Multi-agent Dynamic Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MDCCTM) for medical consultation, enabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a Syndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Retrieval Scheme (DSRS) are developed to significantly enhance the capacity of JF for disease treatment based on syndrome differentiation. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs but also promotes the effective practice of TCM in human health protection and disease treatment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyi Shen, Hao Sun, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Ton</p>
<p>Abstract: Building neural reward models from human preferences is a pivotal component in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and large language model alignment research. Given the scarcity and high cost of human annotation, how to select the most informative pairs to annotate is an essential yet challenging open problem. In this work, we highlight the insight that an ideal comparison dataset for reward modeling should balance exploration of the representation space and make informative comparisons between pairs with moderate reward differences. Technically, challenges arise in quantifying the two objectives and efficiently prioritizing the comparisons to be annotated. To address this, we propose the Fisher information-based selection strategies, adapt theories from the classical experimental design literature, and apply them to the final linear layer of the deep neural network-based reward modeling tasks. Empirically, our method demonstrates remarkable performance, high computational efficiency, and stability compared to other selection methods from deep learning and classical statistical literature across multiple open-source LLMs and datasets. Further ablation studies reveal that incorporating cross-prompt comparisons in active reward modeling significantly enhances labeling efficiency, shedding light on the potential for improved annotation strategies in RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: In response to the success of proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4, there is a growing interest in developing open, non-proprietary LLMs and AI foundation models (AIFMs) for transparent use in academic, scientific, and non-commercial applications. Despite their inability to match the refined functionalities of their proprietary counterparts, open models hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare applications. In this paper, we examine the prospects of open-source LLMs and AIFMs for developing healthcare applications and make two key contributions. Firstly, we present a comprehensive survey of the current state-of-the-art open-source healthcare LLMs and AIFMs and introduce a taxonomy of these open AIFMs, categorizing their utility across various healthcare tasks. Secondly, to evaluate the general-purpose applications of open LLMs in healthcare, we present a case study on personalized prescriptions. This task is particularly significant due to its critical role in delivering tailored, patient-specific medications that can greatly improve treatment outcomes. In addition, we compare the performance of open-source models with proprietary models in settings with and without Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings suggest that, although less refined, open LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models when paired with grounding techniques such as RAG. Furthermore, to highlight the clinical significance of LLMs-empowered personalized prescriptions, we perform subjective assessment through an expert clinician. We also elaborate on ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the misuse of powerful LLMs and AIFMs, highlighting the need for a cautious and responsible implementation in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial strides in structured tasks through Reinforcement Learning (RL), demonstrating proficiency in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, applying RL in broader domains like chatbots and content generation -- through the process known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) -- presents unique challenges. Reward models in RLHF are critical, acting as proxies that evaluate the alignment of LLM outputs with human intent. Despite advancements, the development of reward models is hindered by challenges such as computational heavy training, costly evaluation, and therefore poor reproducibility. We advocate for using embedding-based input in reward model research as an accelerated solution to those challenges. By leveraging embeddings for reward modeling, we can enhance reproducibility, reduce computational demands on hardware, improve training stability, and significantly reduce training and evaluation costs, hence facilitating fair and efficient comparisons in this active research area. We then show a case study of reproducing existing reward model ensemble research using embedding-based reward models. We discussed future avenues for research, aiming to contribute to safer and more effective LLM deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliot Meyerson, Xin Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Hu, Eric Liu, Weizhou Wang, Xiangyu Guo, David Lie</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs to knowledge retrieved from external sources. The use of private resources and data in constructing these external data stores can expose them to risks of extraction attacks, in which attackers attempt to steal data from these private databases. Existing RAG extraction attacks often rely on manually crafted prompts, which limit their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a framework called MARAGE for optimizing an adversarial string that, when appended to user queries submitted to a target RAG system, causes outputs containing the retrieved RAG data verbatim. MARAGE leverages a continuous optimization scheme that integrates gradients from multiple models with different architectures simultaneously to enhance the transferability of the optimized string to unseen models. Additionally, we propose a strategy that emphasizes the initial tokens in the target RAG data, further improving the attack's generalizability. Evaluations show that MARAGE consistently outperforms both manual and optimization-based baselines across multiple LLMs and RAG datasets, while maintaining robust transferability to previously unseen models. Moreover, we conduct probing tasks to shed light on the reasons why MARAGE is more effective compared to the baselines and to analyze the impact of our approach on the model's internal state.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have driven the growth of text-guided image editing tools, enabling precise and iterative modifications of synthesized content. However, as these tools become increasingly accessible, they also introduce significant risks of misuse, emphasizing the critical need for robust attribution methods to ensure content authenticity and traceability. Despite the creative potential of such tools, they pose significant challenges for attribution, particularly in adversarial settings where edits can be layered to obscure an image's origins. We propose LambdaTracer, a novel latent-space attribution method that robustly identifies and differentiates authentic outputs from manipulated ones without requiring any modifications to generative or editing pipelines. By adaptively calibrating reconstruction losses, LambdaTracer remains effective across diverse iterative editing processes, whether automated through text-guided editing tools such as InstructPix2Pix and ControlNet or performed manually with editing software such as Adobe Photoshop. Extensive experiments reveal that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in distinguishing maliciously edited images, providing a practical solution to safeguard ownership, creativity, and credibility in the open, fast-evolving AI ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of social media has accelerated the dissemination of information, but it has also facilitated the spread of harmful rumours, which can disrupt economies, influence political outcomes, and exacerbate public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches have shown significant promise in automated rumour detection, they often lack transparency, making their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing graph explainability techniques fall short in addressing the unique challenges posed by the dependencies among feature dimensions in high-dimensional text embeddings used in GNN-based models. In this paper, we introduce Contrastive Token Layerwise Relevance Propagation (CT-LRP), a novel framework designed to enhance the explainability of GNN-based rumour detection. CT-LRP extends current graph explainability methods by providing token-level explanations that offer greater granularity and interpretability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CT-LRP across multiple GNN models trained on three publicly available rumour detection datasets, demonstrating that it consistently produces high-fidelity, meaningful explanations, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy rumour detection systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image classification is a vital research area that utilizes advanced computational techniques to improve disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have transformed this field by providing automated and precise analysis of complex medical images. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning model that integrates a pre-trained ResNet101 with a custom CNN to classify kidney CT images into four categories: normal, stone, cyst, and tumor. The proposed model leverages feature fusion to enhance classification accuracy, achieving 99.73% training accuracy and 100% testing accuracy. Using a dataset of 12,446 CT images and advanced feature mapping techniques, the hybrid CNN model outperforms standalone ResNet101. This architecture delivers a robust and efficient solution for automated kidney disease diagnosis, providing improved precision, recall, and reduced testing time, making it highly suitable for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Zhang, Hui Kang, Yang Liu, Fang Mei, Hongjuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-based arbitrary style transfer methods have gained significant attention recently due to their impressive ability to synthesize style details. However, the point-wise matching within the attention mechanism may overly focus on local patterns such that neglect the remarkable global features of style images. Additionally, when processing large images, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism will bring high computational load. To alleviate above problems, we propose Holistic Style Injector (HSI), a novel attention-style transformation module to deliver artistic expression of target style. Specifically, HSI performs stylization only based on global style representation that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer, to avoid generating local disharmonious patterns in stylized images. Moreover, we propose a dual relation learning mechanism inside the HSI to dynamically render images by leveraging semantic similarity in content and style, ensuring the stylized images preserve the original content and improve style fidelity. Note that the proposed HSI achieves linear computational complexity because it establishes feature mapping through element-wise multiplication rather than matrix multiplication. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglin Zhou, Xiaobo Xia, Fan Ma, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D generation automates 3D content creation from textual descriptions, which offers transformative potential across various fields. However, existing methods often struggle to align generated content with human preferences, limiting their applicability and flexibility. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose DreamDPO, an optimization-based framework that integrates human preferences into the 3D generation process, through direct preference optimization. Practically, DreamDPO first constructs pairwise examples, then compare their alignment with human preferences using reward or large multimodal models, and lastly optimizes the 3D representation with a preference-driven loss function. By leveraging pairwise comparison to reflect preferences, DreamDPO reduces reliance on precise pointwise quality evaluations while enabling fine-grained controllability through preference-guided optimization. Experiments demonstrate that DreamDPO achieves competitive results, and provides higher-quality and more controllable 3D content compared to existing methods. The code and models will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zining Zhu, Liang Zhao, Kangheng Lin, Jinze Yang, En Yu, Chenglong Liu, Haoran Wei, Jianjian Sun, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Perceptual Preference Optimization (PerPO), a perception alignment method aimed at addressing the visual discrimination challenges in generative pre-trained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To align MLLMs with human visual perception process, PerPO employs discriminative rewarding to gather diverse negative samples, followed by listwise preference optimization to rank them.By utilizing the reward as a quantitative margin for ranking, our method effectively bridges generative preference optimization and discriminative empirical risk minimization. PerPO significantly enhances MLLMs' visual discrimination capabilities while maintaining their generative strengths, mitigates image-unconditional reward hacking, and ensures consistent performance across visual tasks. This work marks a crucial step towards more perceptually aligned and versatile MLLMs. We also hope that PerPO will encourage the community to rethink MLLM alignment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliano Genari, Guilherme Tegoni Goedert</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraction of relevant data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is crucial to identifying symptoms and automating epidemiological surveillance processes. By harnessing the vast amount of unstructured text in EHRs, we can detect patterns that indicate the onset of disease outbreaks, enabling faster, more targeted public health responses. Our proposed framework provides a flexible and efficient solution for mining data from unstructured texts, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling by specialists. Experiments show that our framework achieving strong performance with as few as 200 manually labeled texts, even for complex classification problems. Additionally, our approach can function with simple lightweight models, achieving competitive and occasionally even better results compared to more resource-intensive deep learning models. This capability not only accelerates processing times but also preserves patient privacy, as the data can be processed on weaker on-site hardware rather than being transferred to external systems. Our methodology, therefore, offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-conscious approach to real-time epidemiological monitoring, equipping health institutions to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging health threats.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing by demonstrating exceptional performance across diverse tasks. This study investigates the impact of the parameter initialization scale on the training behavior and task preferences of LLMs. We discover that smaller initialization scales encourage models to favor reasoning tasks, whereas larger initialization scales lead to a preference for memorization tasks. We validate this reasoning bias via real datasets and meticulously designed anchor functions. Further analysis of initial training dynamics suggests that specific model components, particularly the embedding space and self-attention mechanisms, play pivotal roles in shaping these learning biases. We provide a theoretical framework from the perspective of model training dynamics to explain these phenomena. Additionally, experiments on real-world language tasks corroborate our theoretical insights. This work enhances our understanding of how initialization strategies influence LLM performance on reasoning tasks and offers valuable guidelines for training models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luciano Baresi, Davide Yi Xian Hu, Muhammad Irfan Mas'udi, Giovanni Quattrocchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of deep learning models requires comprehensive and diverse testing. Existing approaches, often based on simple data augmentation techniques or generative adversarial networks, are limited in producing realistic and varied test cases. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework for testing vision neural networks that leverages Large Language Models and control-conditioned Diffusion Models to generate synthetic, high-fidelity test cases. Our approach begins by translating images into detailed textual descriptions using a captioning model, allowing the language model to identify modifiable aspects of the image and generate counterfactual descriptions. These descriptions are then used to produce new test images through a text-to-image diffusion process that preserves spatial consistency and maintains the critical elements of the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two datasets: ImageNet1K for image classification and SHIFT for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. The results show that our approach can generate significant test cases that reveal weaknesses and improve the robustness of the model through targeted retraining. We conducted a human assessment using Mechanical Turk to validate the generated images. The responses from the participants confirmed, with high agreement among the voters, that our approach produces valid and realistic images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenqing Ling, Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we study the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations for both inter- and intra-diversity. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-development for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyao Zheng, Michael A. Jacobs, Vladimir Braverman, Vishwa S. Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized medical imaging by enabling efficient and generalizable feature extraction from large-scale unlabeled datasets. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been extended to three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) data, generating compact, information-rich embeddings with 1408 features that achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, these embeddings have been shown to encode demographic information, such as age, sex, and race, which poses a significant risk to the fairness of clinical applications.
  In this work, we propose a Variation Autoencoder (VAE) based adversarial debiasing framework to transform these embeddings into a new latent space where demographic information is no longer encoded, while maintaining the performance of critical downstream tasks. We validated our approach on the NLST lung cancer screening dataset, demonstrating that the debiased embeddings effectively eliminate multiple encoded demographic information and improve fairness without compromising predictive accuracy for lung cancer risk at 1-year and 2-year intervals. Additionally, our approach ensures the embeddings are robust against adversarial bias attacks. These results highlight the potential of adversarial debiasing techniques to ensure fairness and equity in clinical applications of self-supervised 3D CT embeddings, paving the way for their broader adoption in unbiased medical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Clemente, Zied Ben Houidi, Alexis Huet, Dario Rossi, Giulio Franzese, Pietro Michiardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) struggle to continually update their knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, humans effortlessly integrate new information, detect conflicts with existing beliefs, and selectively update their mental models. This paper introduces a cognitive-inspired investigation paradigm to study continual knowledge updating in LLMs. We implement two key components inspired by human cognition: (1) Dissonance and Familiarity Awareness, analyzing model behavior to classify information as novel, familiar, or dissonant; and (2) Targeted Network Updates, which track neural activity to identify frequently used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. Through carefully designed experiments in controlled settings, we uncover a number of empirical findings demonstrating the potential of this approach. First, dissonance detection is feasible using simple activation and gradient features, suggesting potential for cognitive-inspired training. Second, we find that non-dissonant updates largely preserve prior knowledge regardless of targeting strategy, revealing inherent robustness in LLM knowledge integration. Most critically, we discover that dissonant updates prove catastrophically destructive to the model's knowledge base, indiscriminately affecting even information unrelated to the current updates. This suggests fundamental limitations in how neural networks handle contradictions and motivates the need for new approaches to knowledge updating that better mirror human cognitive mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siru Zhong, Weilin Ruan, Ming Jin, Huan Li, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in time series forecasting have explored augmenting models with text or vision modalities to improve accuracy. While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.30% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an approach to identifying which ransomware adversaries are most likely to target specific entities, thereby assisting these entities in formulating better protection strategies. Ransomware poses a formidable cybersecurity threat characterized by profit-driven motives, a complex underlying economy supporting criminal syndicates, and the overt nature of its attacks. This type of malware has consistently ranked among the most prevalent, with a rapid escalation in activity observed. Recent estimates indicate that approximately two-thirds of organizations experienced ransomware attacks in 2023 \cite{Sophos2023Ransomware}. A central tactic in ransomware campaigns is publicizing attacks to coerce victims into paying ransoms. Our study utilizes public disclosures from ransomware victims to predict the likelihood of an entity being targeted by a specific ransomware variant. We employ a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that uses a unique chain-of-thought, multi-shot prompt methodology to define adversary SKRAM (Skills, Knowledge, Resources, Authorities, and Motivation) profiles from ransomware bulletins, threat reports, and news items. This analysis is enriched with publicly available victim data and is further enhanced by a heuristic for generating synthetic data that reflects victim profiles. Our work culminates in the development of a machine learning model that assists organizations in prioritizing ransomware threats and formulating defenses based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the most likely attackers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Neng Chuang, Leisheng Yu, Guanchu Wang, Lizhe Zhang, Zirui Liu, Xuanting Cai, Yang Sui, Vladimir Braverman, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed and democratized on edge devices. To improve the efficiency of on-device deployment, small language models (SLMs) are often adopted due to their efficient decoding latency and reduced energy consumption. However, these SLMs often generate inaccurate responses when handling complex queries. One promising solution is uncertainty-based SLM routing, offloading high-stakes queries to stronger LLMs when resulting in low-confidence responses on SLM. This follows the principle of "If you lack confidence, seek stronger support" to enhance reliability. Relying on more powerful LLMs is yet effective but increases invocation costs. Therefore, striking a routing balance between efficiency and efficacy remains a critical challenge. Additionally, efficiently generalizing the routing strategy to new datasets remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of uncertainty-driven routing strategies from SLMs to LLMs over 1500+ settings. Our findings highlight: First, uncertainty-correctness alignment in different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods significantly impacts routing performance. Second, uncertainty distributions depend more on both the specific SLM and the chosen UQ method, rather than downstream data. Building on the insight, we propose a calibration data construction instruction pipeline and open-source a constructed hold-out set to enhance routing generalization on new downstream scenarios. The experimental results indicate calibration data effectively bootstraps routing performance without any new data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Testing and debugging quantum software pose significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. One challenge is indeterminacy, a fundamental characteristic of quantum systems, which increases the likelihood of flaky tests in quantum programs. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on quantum flakiness in the existing literature. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning platform that leverages multiple machine learning models to automatically detect flaky tests in quantum programs. Our evaluation shows that the extreme gradient boosting and decision tree-based models outperform other models (i.e., random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine), achieving the highest F1 score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient in a balanced dataset and an imbalanced dataset, respectively. Furthermore, we expand the currently limited dataset for researchers interested in quantum flaky tests. In the future, we plan to explore the development of unsupervised learning techniques to detect and classify quantum flaky tests more effectively. These advancements aim to improve the reliability and robustness of quantum software testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image generation abilities of text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced, yielding highly photo-realistic images from descriptive text and increasing the viability of leveraging synthetic images to train computer vision models. To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical problem in computer vision, essential for understanding how objects move and interact in videos. This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The last decade has seen widespread adoption of Machine Learning (ML) components in software systems. This has occurred in nearly every domain, from natural language processing to computer vision. These ML components range from relatively simple neural networks to complex and resource-intensive large language models. However, despite this widespread adoption, little is known about the supply chain relationships that produce these models, which can have implications for compliance and security. In this work, we conduct an extensive analysis of 760,460 models and 175,000 datasets mined from the popular model-sharing site Hugging Face. First, we evaluate the current state of documentation in the Hugging Face supply chain, report real-world examples of shortcomings, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement. Next, we analyze the underlying structure of the extant supply chain. Finally, we explore the current licensing landscape against what was reported in prior work and discuss the unique challenges posed in this domain. Our results motivate multiple research avenues, including the need for better license management for ML models/datasets, better support for model documentation, and automated inconsistency checking and validation. We make our research infrastructure and dataset available to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Nicolas Astorga, Tennison Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) across various benchmarks, their ability to address ambiguously specified problems--frequent in real-world interactions--remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a formal definition of task ambiguity and frame the problem of task disambiguation through the lens of Bayesian Experimental Design. By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task specifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and reducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating effective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of meta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed approach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted questions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts the load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that this form of question selection leads to more effective task disambiguation in comparison to approaches relying on reasoning solely within the space of questions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion has recently made substantial progress, but many models still depend on external supervised systems to disentangle speaker identity and linguistic content. Furthermore, current methods often use parallel conversion, where the converted speech inherits the source utterance's temporal structure, restricting speaker similarity and privacy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVC, a generative zero-shot voice conversion model. GenVC learns to disentangle linguistic content and speaker style in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for external models and enabling efficient training on large, unlabeled datasets. Experimental results show that GenVC achieves state-of-the-art speaker similarity while maintaining naturalness competitive with leading approaches. Its autoregressive generation also allows the converted speech to deviate from the source utterance's temporal structure. This feature makes GenVC highly effective for voice anonymization, as it minimizes the preservation of source prosody and speaker characteristics, enhancing privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseok Jung, Cynthia Fuertes Panizo, Liam Dugan, May Fung, Pin-Yu Chen, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., {\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text. However, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for subgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles than open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification that disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and learns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of performance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and decreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework paves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated output detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Ji, Hanchun Wang, Antonio Filieri, Ilenia Epifani</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic model checking traditionally verifies properties on the expected value of a measure of interest. This restriction may fail to capture the quality of service of a significant proportion of a system's runs, especially when the probability distribution of the measure of interest is poorly represented by its expected value due to heavy-tail behaviors or multiple modalities. Recent works inspired by distributional reinforcement learning use discrete histograms to approximate integer reward distribution, but they struggle with continuous reward space and present challenges in balancing accuracy and scalability. We propose a novel method for handling both continuous and discrete reward distributions in Discrete Time Markov Chains using moment matching with Erlang mixtures. By analytically deriving higher-order moments through Moment Generating Functions, our method approximates the reward distribution with theoretically bounded error while preserving the statistical properties of the true distribution. This detailed distributional insight enables the formulation and robust model checking of quality properties based on the entire reward distribution function, rather than restricting to its expected value. We include a theoretical foundation ensuring bounded approximation errors, along with an experimental evaluation demonstrating our method's accuracy and scalability in practical model-checking problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Lu, Y. Jennifer Sun, Zhiyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Focusing on the expert problem in online learning, this paper studies the interpolation of several performance metrics via $\phi$-regret minimization, which measures the performance of an algorithm by its regret with respect to an arbitrary action modification rule $\phi$. With $d$ experts and $T\gg d$ rounds in total, we present a single algorithm achieving the instance-adaptive $\phi$-regret bound \begin{equation*} \tilde O\left(\min\left\{\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi+1},\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi}\right\}\cdot\sqrt{T}\right), \end{equation*} where $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi$ is the maximum amount of experts modified identically by $\phi$, and $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi$ is the amount of experts that $\phi$ trivially modifies to themselves. By recovering the optimal $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$ external regret bound when $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi=d$, the standard $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ internal regret bound when $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi=d-1$ and the optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT})$ swap regret bound in the worst case, we improve existing results in the intermediate regimes. In addition, the same algorithm achieves the optimal quantile regret bound, which corresponds to even easier settings of $\phi$ than the external regret.
  Building on the classical reduction from $\phi$-regret minimization to external regret minimization on stochastic matrices, our main idea is to further convert the latter to online linear regression using Haar-wavelet-inspired matrix features. Then, we apply a particular $L_1$-version of comparator-adaptive online learning algorithms to exploit the sparsity in this regression subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Wang, Bochuan Cao, Yuanpu Cao, Jinghui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to struggle with consistently generating truthful responses. While various representation intervention techniques have been proposed, these methods typically apply a universal representation correction vector to all input queries, limiting their effectiveness against diverse queries in practice. In this study, we introduce TruthFlow, a novel method that leverages the Flow Matching technique for query-specific truthful representation correction. Specifically, TruthFlow first uses a flow model to learn query-specific correction vectors that transition representations from hallucinated to truthful states. Then, during inference, the trained flow model generates these correction vectors to enhance the truthfulness of LLM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that TruthFlow significantly improves performance on open-ended generation tasks across various advanced LLMs evaluated on TruthfulQA. Moreover, the trained TruthFlow model exhibits strong transferability, performing effectively on other unseen hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Guo, Molei Tao, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation of probability distributions, we propose a new normalizing constant estimation algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers and establish a framework for analyzing its complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Kumar, George Torres, Noah Guzinski, Gaurav Panwar, Reza Tourani, Satyajayant Misra, Marcin Spoczynski, Mona Vij, Nageen Himayat</p>
<p>Abstract: The privacy vulnerabilities of the federated learning (FL) paradigm, primarily caused by gradient leakage, have prompted the development of various defensive measures. Nonetheless, these solutions have predominantly been crafted for and assessed in the context of synchronous FL systems, with minimal focus on asynchronous FL. This gap arises in part due to the unique challenges posed by the asynchronous setting, such as the lack of coordinated updates, increased variability in client participation, and the potential for more severe privacy risks. These concerns have stymied the adoption of asynchronous FL. In this work, we first demonstrate the privacy vulnerabilities of asynchronous FL through a novel data reconstruction attack that exploits gradient updates to recover sensitive client data. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a privacy-preserving framework that combines a gradient obfuscation mechanism with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for secure asynchronous FL aggregation at the network edge. To overcome the limitations of conventional enclave attestation, we introduce a novel data-centric attestation mechanism based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption. This mechanism enables clients to implicitly verify TEE-based aggregation services, effectively handle on-demand client participation, and scale seamlessly with an increasing number of asynchronous connections. Our gradient obfuscation mechanism reduces the structural similarity index of data reconstruction by 85% and increases reconstruction error by 400%, while our framework improves attestation efficiency by lowering average latency by up to 1500% compared to RA-TLS, without additional overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaole Zhang, Peiyu Zhang, Xiongye Xiao, Shixuan Li, Vasileios Tzoumas, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via \textit{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) for \textit{fractional-order linear time-invariant }(FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, \textbf{F}ractional-\textbf{O}rder \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{C}ontrol (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussian multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks have shown substantial promise at automatic theorem-proving in interactive proof assistants (ITPs) like Lean and Coq. However, most neural theorem-proving models are restricted to specific ITPs, leaving out opportunities for cross-lingual $\textit{transfer}$ between ITPs. We address this weakness with a multilingual proof framework, ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$, that allows a standardized form of interaction between neural theorem-provers and two established ITPs (Coq and Lean). It enables the collection of multilingual proof step data -- data recording the result of proof actions on ITP states -- for training neural provers. ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ allows the systematic evaluation of a model's performance across different ITPs and problem domains via efficient parallel proof search algorithms. We show that multilingual training enabled by ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ can lead to successful transfer across ITPs. Specifically, a model trained on a mix of ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$-generated Coq and Lean data outperforms Lean-only and Coq-only models on the standard prove-at-$k$ metric.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ojash Neopane, Aaditya Ramdas, Aarti Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimation and inference for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a cornerstone of causal inference and often serves as the foundation for developing procedures for more complicated settings. Although traditionally analyzed in a batch setting, recent advances in martingale theory have paved the way for adaptive methods that can enhance the power of downstream inference. Despite these advances, progress in understanding and developing adaptive algorithms remains in its early stages. Existing work either focus on asymptotic analyses that overlook exploration-exploitation tradeoffs relevant in finite-sample regimes or rely on simpler but suboptimal estimators. In this work, we address these limitations by studying adaptive sampling procedures that take advantage of the asymptotically optimal Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) estimator. Our analysis uncovers challenges obscured by asymptotic approaches and introduces a novel algorithmic design principle reminiscent of optimism in multiarmed bandits. This principled approach enables our algorithm to achieve significant theoretical and empirical gains compared to prior methods. Our findings mark a step forward in advancing adaptive causal inference methods in theory and practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chashi Mahiul Islam, Samuel Jacob Chacko, Mao Nishino, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While transformer-based models dominate NLP and vision applications, their underlying mechanisms to map the input space to the label space semantically are not well understood. In this paper, we study the sources of known representation vulnerabilities of vision transformers (ViT), where perceptually identical images can have very different representations and semantically unrelated images can have the same representation. Our analysis indicates that imperceptible changes to the input can result in significant representation changes, particularly in later layers, suggesting potential instabilities in the performance of ViTs. Our comprehensive study reveals that adversarial effects, while subtle in early layers, propagate and amplify through the network, becoming most pronounced in middle to late layers. This insight motivates the development of NeuroShield-ViT, a novel defense mechanism that strategically neutralizes vulnerable neurons in earlier layers to prevent the cascade of adversarial effects. We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness across various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative attacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Without fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on adversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods. Our results shed new light on how adversarial effects propagate through ViT layers, while providing a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks. Additionally, they provide a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S Sreehari, Dilavar P D, S M Anzar, Alavikunhu Panthakkan, Saad Ali Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: Fingerprint recognition remains one of the most reliable biometric technologies due to its high accuracy and uniqueness. Traditional systems rely on contact-based scanners, which are prone to issues such as image degradation from surface contamination and inconsistent user interaction. To address these limitations, contactless fingerprint recognition has emerged as a promising alternative, providing non-intrusive and hygienic authentication. This study evaluates the impact of image enhancement tech-niques on the performance of pre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning for touchless fingerprint recognition. The IIT-Bombay Touchless and Touch-Based Fingerprint Database, containing data from 200 subjects, was employed to test the per-formance of deep learning architectures such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning methods with fingerprint image enhance-ment (indirect method) significantly outperform those without enhancement (direct method). Specifically, VGG-16 achieved an accuracy of 98% in training and 93% in testing when using the enhanced images, demonstrating superior performance compared to the direct method.
  This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of image enhancement in improving the accuracy of transfer learning models for touchless fingerprint recognition, offering key insights for developing more efficient biometric systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on challenging benchmarks that are often structured as multiple-choice question-answering (QA) tasks. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs but provides only vague and generic guidance ("think step by step"). This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive and effective zero-shot prompting method that explicitly incorporates three key steps in QA solving: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Comprehensive experiments across diverse and challenging QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently improves the Baseline (without ARR prompting) and outperforms CoT. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each component: analyzing, retrieving, and reasoning. Notably, intent analysis plays a vital role in ARR. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper emphasizes the critical gap in the evaluation of Explainable AI (XAI) due to the lack of standardized and reliable metrics, which diminishes its practical value, trustworthiness, and ability to meet regulatory requirements. Current evaluation methods are often fragmented, subjective, and biased, making them prone to manipulation and complicating the assessment of complex models. A central issue is the absence of a ground truth for explanations, complicating comparisons across various XAI approaches. To address these challenges, we advocate for widespread research into developing robust, context-sensitive evaluation metrics. These metrics should be resistant to manipulation, relevant to each use case, and based on human judgment and real-world applicability. We also recommend creating domain-specific evaluation benchmarks that align with the user and regulatory needs of sectors such as healthcare and finance. By encouraging collaboration among academia, industry, and regulators, we can create standards that balance flexibility and consistency, ensuring XAI explanations are meaningful, trustworthy, and compliant with evolving regulations.</p>

We propose a novel doubly robust meta-learner for the Conditional Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (CATT), reducing the estimation to a convex risk minimization problem involving a set of auxiliary models. Our framework allows for the flexible estimation of the CATT, when conditioning on any subset of variables of interest using generic machine learning. Leveraging Neyman orthogonality, our proposed approach is robust to estimation errors in the auxiliary models. As a generalization to our main result, we develop a meta-learning approach for the estimation of general conditional functionals under covariate shift. We also provide an extension to the instrumented DiD setting with non-compliance. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven closures correct the standard reduced order models (ROMs) to increase their accuracy in under-resolved, convection-dominated flows. There are two types of data-driven ROM closures in current use: (i) structural, with simple ansatzes (e.g., linear or quadratic); and (ii) machine learning-based, with neural network ansatzes. We propose a novel symbolic regression (SR) data-driven ROM closure strategy, which combines the advantages of current approaches and eliminates their drawbacks. As a result, the new data-driven SR closures yield ROMs that are interpretable, parsimonious, accurate, generalizable, and robust. To compare the data-driven SR-ROM closures with the structural and machine learning-based ROM closures, we consider the data-driven variational multiscale ROM framework and two under-resolved, convection-dominated test problems: the flow past a cylinder and the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 10000, 15000, and 20000. This numerical investigation shows that the new data-driven SR-ROM closures yield more accurate and robust ROMs than the structural and machine learning ROM closures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Binzhu Sha, Jing Yang, Zhuo Wang, Fan Fan, Zhiyong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Melody preservation is crucial in singing voice conversion (SVC). However, in many scenarios, audio is often accompanied with background music (BGM), which can cause audio distortion and interfere with the extraction of melody and other key features, significantly degrading SVC performance. Previous methods have attempted to address this by using more robust neural network-based melody extractors, but their performance drops sharply in the presence of complex accompaniment. Other approaches involve performing source separation before conversion, but this often introduces noticeable artifacts, leading to a significant drop in conversion quality and increasing the user's operational costs. To address these issues, we introduce a novel SVC method that uses self-supervised representation-based melody features to improve melody modeling accuracy in the presence of BGM. In our experiments, we compare the effectiveness of different self-supervised learning (SSL) models for melody extraction and explore for the first time how SSL benefits the task of melody extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SVC model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of melody accuracy and shows higher similarity and naturalness in both subjective and objective evaluations across noisy and clean audio environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning informative representations of phylogenetic tree structures is essential for analyzing evolutionary relationships. Classical distance-based methods have been widely used to project phylogenetic trees into Euclidean space, but they are often sensitive to the choice of distance metric and may lack sufficient resolution.

Leveraging an efficient encoding mechanism inspired by autoregressive tree topology generation, we develop a deep latent-variable generative model that facilitates fast, parallelized topology generation. PhyloVAE combines this generative model with a collaborative inference model based on learnable topological features, allowing for high-resolution representations of phylogenetic tree samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate PhyloVAE's robust representation learning capabilities and fast generation of phylogenetic tree topologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) such as fall detection has become increasingly critical due to the aging population, necessitating effective monitoring systems to prevent serious injuries and fatalities associated with falls. This study focuses on fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model specifically for HAR using radar-based Time-Doppler signatures. Unlike traditional image datasets, these signals present unique challenges due to their non-visual nature and the high degree of similarity among various activities. Directly fine-tuning the ViT with all parameters proves suboptimal for this application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in the weight space to facilitate knowledge transfer from pre-trained ViT models. Additionally, to extract fine-grained features, we enhance feature representation through the integration of a serial-parallel adapter in the feature space. Our innovative joint fine-tuning method, tailored for radar-based Time-Doppler signatures, significantly improves HAR accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methodologies in this domain.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted in diagnostic medical imaging. However, the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale medical datasets presents a significant challenge, often necessitating the use of transfer learning approaches. This study investigates self-supervised learning methods for pre-training capsule networks in polyp diagnostics for colon cancer. We used the PICCOLO dataset, comprising 3,433 samples, which exemplifies typical challenges in medical datasets: small size, class imbalance, and distribution shifts between data splits. Capsule networks offer inherent interpretability due to their architecture and inter-layer information routing mechanism. However, their limited native implementation in mainstream deep learning frameworks and the lack of pre-trained versions pose a significant challenge. This is particularly true if aiming to train them on small medical datasets, where leveraging pre-trained weights as initial parameters would be beneficial. We explored two auxiliary self-supervised learning tasks, colourisation and contrastive learning, for capsule network pre-training. We compared self-supervised pre-trained models against alternative initialisation strategies. Our findings suggest that contrastive learning and in-painting techniques are suitable auxiliary tasks for self-supervised learning in the medical domain. These techniques helped guide the model to capture important visual features that are beneficial for the downstream task of polyp classification, increasing its accuracy by 5.26% compared to other weight initialisation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thang D. Bui, Matthew Ashman, Richard E. Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian process (GP) approximations based on inducing points have become the de facto standard for scaling GPs to large datasets, owing to their theoretical elegance, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation. This paper introduces a provably tighter variational approximation by relaxing the standard assumption that the conditional approximate posterior given the inducing points must match that in the prior. The key innovation is to modify the conditional posterior to have smaller variances than that of the prior at the training points. We derive the collapsed bound for the regression case, describe how to use the proposed approximation in large data settings, and discuss its application to handle orthogonally structured inducing points and GP latent variable models. Extensive experiments on regression benchmarks, classification, and latent variable models demonstrate that the proposed approximation consistently matches or outperforms standard sparse variational GPs while maintaining the same computational cost. An implementation will be made available in all popular GP packages.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodological framework for detecting and classifying latent constructs, including frames, narratives, and topics, from textual data using Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed hybrid approach combines automated summarization with human-in-the-loop validation to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of construct identification. By employing iterative sampling coupled with expert refinement, the framework guarantees methodological robustness and ensures conceptual precision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenjian Li, Mingsheng Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the DP (differential privacy) properties of the quantum recommendation algorithm and the quantum-inspired-classical recommendation algorithm. We discover that the quantum recommendation algorithm is a privacy curating mechanism on its own, requiring no external noise, which is different from traditional differential privacy mechanisms. In our analysis, a novel perturbation method tailored for SVD (singular value decomposition) and low-rank matrix approximation problems is introduced. Using the perturbation method and random matrix theory, we are able to derive that both the quantum and quantum-inspired-classical algorithms are $\big(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac 1n\big),\,\, \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac{1}{\min\{m,n\}}\big)\big)$-DP under some reasonable restrictions, where $m$ and $n$ are numbers of users and products in the input preference database respectively. Nevertheless, a comparison shows that the quantum algorithm has better privacy preserving potential than the classical one.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilherme Dean Pelegrina, Patrick Kolpaczki, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: The Shapley value is the prevalent solution for fair division problems in which a payout is to be divided among multiple agents. By adopting a game-theoretic view, the idea of fair division and the Shapley value can also be used in machine learning to quantify the individual contribution of features or data points to the performance of a predictive model. Despite its popularity and axiomatic justification, the Shapley value suffers from a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of entities involved, and hence requires approximation methods for its reliable estimation. We propose SVA$k_{\text{ADD}}$, a novel approximation method that fits a $k$-additive surrogate game. By taking advantage of $k$-additivity, we are able to elicit the exact Shapley values of the surrogate game and then use these values as estimates for the original fair division problem. The efficacy of our method is evaluated empirically and compared to competing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wolfgang Mack, Ahmed Mustafa, Rafa{\l} {\L}aganowski, Samer Hijazy</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural codecs, comprising an encoder, quantizer, and decoder, enable signal transmission at exceptionally low bitrates. Training these systems requires techniques like the straight-through estimator, soft-to-hard annealing, or statistical quantizer emulation to allow a non-zero gradient across the quantizer. Evaluating the effect of quantization in neural codecs, like the influence of gradient passing techniques on the whole system, is often costly and time-consuming due to training demands and the lack of affordable and reliable metrics. This paper proposes an efficient evaluation framework for neural codecs using simulated data with a defined number of bits and low-complexity neural encoders/decoders to emulate the non-linear behavior in larger networks. Our system is highly efficient in terms of training time and computational and hardware requirements, allowing us to uncover distinct behaviors in neural codecs. We propose a modification to stabilize training with the straight-through estimator based on our findings. We validate our findings against an internal neural audio codec and against the state-of-the-art descript-audio-codec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen</p>
<p>Abstract: A/B-tests are a cornerstone of experimental design on the web, with wide-ranging applications and use-cases. The statistical $t$-test comparing differences in means is the most commonly used method for assessing treatment effects, often justified through the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT ascertains that, as the sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the Average Treatment Effect converges to normality, making the $t$-test valid for sufficiently large sample sizes. When outcome measures are skewed or non-normal, quantifying what "sufficiently large" entails is not straightforward.
  To ensure that confidence intervals maintain proper coverage and that $p$-values accurately reflect the false positive rate, it is critical to validate this normality assumption. We propose a practical method to test this, by analysing repeatedly resampled A/A-tests. When the normality assumption holds, the resulting $p$-value distribution should be uniform, and this property can be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This provides an efficient and effective way to empirically assess whether the $t$-test's assumptions are met, and the A/B-test is valid. We demonstrate our methodology and highlight how it helps to identify scenarios prone to inflated Type-I errors. Our approach provides a practical framework to ensure and improve the reliability and robustness of A/B-testing practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Zhou, Jintao Xu, Chenglong Bao, Chao Ding, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of a nonconvex function with a Lipschitz continuous Hessian and propose a quadratic regularized Newton method incorporating a new class of regularizers constructed from the current and previous gradients. The method leverages a recently developed linear conjugate gradient approach with a negative curvature monitor to solve the regularized Newton equation. Notably, our algorithm is adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, and achieves a global complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}}) + \tilde O(1)$ in terms of the second-order oracle calls, and $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-\frac{7}{4}})$ for Hessian-vector products, respectively. Moreover, when the iterates converge to a point where the Hessian is positive definite, the method exhibits quadratic local convergence. Preliminary numerical results illustrate the competitiveness of our algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meshi Bashari, Matteo Sesia, Yaniv Romano</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a flexible framework for calibrating machine learning predictions, providing distribution-free statistical guarantees. In outlier detection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to control the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier reference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves access to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers. This paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of conformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings, calibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control, shedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This conservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that leverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to selectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are suspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this ``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the risk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experiments on real datasets validate the conservative behavior of conformal methods under contamination and show that the proposed data-cleaning strategy improves power without sacrificing validity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), which decodes spoken words from video data, offers significant benefits, particularly when audio is unavailable. However, the high dimensionality of video data leads to prohibitive computational costs that demand powerful hardware, limiting VSR deployment on resource-constrained devices. This work addresses this limitation by developing lightweight VSR architectures. Leveraging efficient operation design paradigms, we create compact yet powerful models with reduced resource requirements and minimal accuracy loss. We train and evaluate our models on a large-scale public dataset for recognition of words from video sequences, demonstrating their effectiveness for practical applications. We also conduct an extensive array of ablative experiments to thoroughly analyze the size and complexity of each model. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The surge of explainable artificial intelligence methods seeks to enhance transparency and explainability in machine learning models. At the same time, there is a growing demand for explaining decisions taken through complex algorithms used in mathematical optimization. However, current explanation methods do not take into account the structure of the underlying optimization problem, leading to unreliable outcomes. In response to this need, we introduce Coherent Local Explanations for Mathematical Optimization (CLEMO). CLEMO provides explanations for multiple components of optimization models, the objective value and decision variables, which are coherent with the underlying model structure. Our sampling-based procedure can provide explanations for the behavior of exact and heuristic solution algorithms. The effectiveness of CLEMO is illustrated by experiments for the shortest path problem, the knapsack problem, and the vehicle routing problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in generative modeling, yet their theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we focus on the Wasserstein convergence analysis of score-based diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the impact of various discretization schemes, including Euler discretization, exponential integrators, and midpoint randomization methods. Our analysis provides a quantitative comparison of these discrete approximations, emphasizing their influence on convergence behavior. Furthermore, we explore scenarios where Hessian information is available and propose an accelerated sampler based on the local linearization method. We demonstrate that this Hessian-based approach achieves faster convergence rates of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ significantly improving upon the standard rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ of vanilla diffusion models, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kapoor, Kale-ab Tessera, Mayank Baranwal, Harshad Khadilkar, Stefano Albrecht, Mingfei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), learning effective policies is challenging when global rewards are sparse and delayed. This difficulty arises from the need to assign credit across both agents and time steps, a problem that existing methods often fail to address in episodic, long-horizon tasks. We propose Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution $TAR^2$, a novel approach that decomposes sparse global rewards into agent-specific, time-step-specific components, thereby providing more frequent and accurate feedback for policy learning. Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns with potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as the original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions identical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit signals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google Research Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and accelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in both learning speed and final performance. These findings establish $TAR^2$ as a principled and practical solution for agent-temporal credit assignment in sparse-reward multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: As platforms increasingly rely on learning algorithms, collectives may form and seek ways to influence these platforms to align with their own interests. This can be achieved by coordinated submission of altered data. To evaluate the potential impact of such behavior, it is essential to understand the computations that collectives must perform to impact platforms in this way. In particular, collectives need to make a priori assessments of the effect of the collective before taking action, as they may face potential risks when modifying their data. Moreover they need to develop implementable coordination algorithms based on quantities that can be inferred from observed data. We develop a framework that provides a theoretical and algorithmic treatment of these issues and present experimental results in a product evaluation domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reihaneh Amooie, Wietse de Vries, Yun Hao, Jelske Dijkstra, Matt Coler, Martijn Wieling</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance for low-resource languages is still far behind that of higher-resource languages such as English, due to a lack of sufficient labeled data. State-of-the-art methods deploy self-supervised transfer learning where a model pre-trained on large amounts of data is fine-tuned using little labeled data in a target low-resource language. In this paper, we present and examine a method for fine-tuning an SSL-based model in order to improve the performance for Frisian and its regional dialects (Clay Frisian, Wood Frisian, and South Frisian). We show that Frisian ASR performance can be improved by using multilingual (Frisian, Dutch, English and German) fine-tuning data and an auxiliary language identification task. In addition, our findings show that performance on dialectal speech suffers substantially, and, importantly, that this effect is moderated by the elicitation approach used to collect the dialectal data. Our findings also particularly suggest that relying solely on standard language data for ASR evaluation may underestimate real-world performance, particularly in languages with substantial dialectal variation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Bao, Shinsaku Sakaue, Yuki Takezawa</p>
<p>Abstract: The gradient descent (GD) has been one of the most common optimizer in machine learning. In particular, the loss landscape of a neural network is typically sharpened during the initial phase of training, making the training dynamics hover on the edge of stability. This is beyond our standard understanding of GD convergence in the stable regime where arbitrarily chosen stepsize is sufficiently smaller than the edge of stability. Recently, Wu et al. (COLT2024) have showed that GD converges with arbitrary stepsize under linearly separable logistic regression. Although their analysis hinges on the self-bounding property of the logistic loss, which seems to be a cornerstone to establish a modified descent lemma, our pilot study shows that other loss functions without the self-bounding property can make GD converge with arbitrary stepsize. To further understand what property of a loss function matters in GD, we aim to show arbitrary-stepsize GD convergence for a general loss function based on the framework of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. We essentially leverage the classical perceptron argument to derive the convergence rate for achieving $\epsilon$-optimal loss, which is possible for a majority of Fenchel--Young losses. Among typical loss functions, the Tsallis entropy achieves the GD convergence rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and the R{\'e}nyi entropy achieves the far better rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/3})$. We argue that these better rate is possible because of \emph{separation margin} of loss functions, instead of the self-bounding property.</p>

We study the consistency of such approximations, and its implication for scalable embeddings of probability measures into a Hilbert space at a low computational cost.

<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for identifying physiological changes associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. The relationship between cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that ECG abnormalities could serve as valuable biomarkers for more efficient detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification. However, the potential of the ECG to accurately distinguish neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly among diverse patient populations, remains underexplored. This study utilized ECG markers and basic demographic data to predict neuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning models, with targets defined through ICD-10 codes. Both internal and external validation were performed using the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets respectively. Performance was assessed using AUROC scores. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley values were applied to provide insights into the contributions of individual ECG features to the predictions. Significant predictive performance was observed for conditions within the neurological and psychiatric groups. For the neurological group, Alzheimer's disease (G30) achieved an internal AUROC of 0.813 (0.812-0.814) and an external AUROC of 0.868 (0.867-0.868). In the psychiatric group, unspecified dementia (F03) showed an internal AUROC of 0.849 (0.848-0.849) and an external AUROC of 0.862 (0.861-0.863). Discriminative features align with known ECG markers but also provide hints on potentially new markers. ECG offers significant promise for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric conditions, with robust predictive performance across internal and external cohorts. Future work should focus on addressing potential confounders, such as therapy-related cardiotoxicity, and expanding the scope of ECG applications, including personalized care and early intervention strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development and operation of smart cities relyheavily on large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and sensor infrastructures that continuously monitor various aspects of urban environments. These networks generate vast amounts of data, posing challenges related to bandwidth usage, energy consumption, and system scalability. This paper introduces a novel sensing paradigm called Data-driven Modality Fusion (DMF), designed to enhance the efficiency of smart city IoT network management. By leveraging correlations between timeseries data from different sensing modalities, the proposed DMF approach reduces the number of physical sensors required for monitoring, thereby minimizing energy expenditure, communication bandwidth, and overall deployment costs. The framework relocates computational complexity from the edge devices to the core, ensuring that resource-constrained IoT devices are not burdened with intensive processing tasks. DMF is validated using data from a real-world IoT deployment in Madrid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately estimating traffic, environmental, and pollution metrics from a reduced set of sensors. The proposed solution offers a scalable, efficient mechanism for managing urban IoT networks, while addressing issues of sensor failure and privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are fragile when confronted with data that significantly deviates from their training distribution. This is true in particular for simulation-based inference methods, such as neural amortized Bayesian inference (ABI), where models trained on simulated data are deployed on noisy real-world observations. Recent robust approaches employ unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to match the embedding spaces of simulated and observed data. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluations across different domain mismatches raises concerns about the reliability in high-stakes applications. We address this gap by systematically testing UDA approaches across a wide range of misspecification scenarios in both a controlled and a high-dimensional benchmark. We demonstrate that aligning summary spaces between domains effectively mitigates the impact of unmodeled phenomena or noise. However, the same alignment mechanism can lead to failures under prior misspecifications - a critical finding with practical consequences. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of misspecification types when using UDA techniques to increase the robustness of ABI in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk level, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly query URL will increase the risk level while query with natural language will mitigate such risk. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4o-based content refinement tool and an XGBoost-based URL detector.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Umra, Aya Mostafa Ahmed, Aydin Sezgin</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in integrated sensing and communication for 6th generation (6G) networks, this paper presents a cognitive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar system enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) for robust multitarget detection in dynamic environments. The system employs a planar array configuration and adapts its transmitted waveforms and beamforming patterns to optimize detection performance in the presence of unknown two-dimensional (2D) disturbances. A robust Wald-type detector is integrated with a SARSA-based RL algorithm, enabling the radar to learn and adapt to complex clutter environments modeled by a 2D autoregressive process. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in detection probability compared to omnidirectional methods, particularly for low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) targets masked by clutter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Hanna Langbein, Niklas Koenen, Marvin N. Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning survival models often outperform classical methods in time-to-event predictions, particularly in personalized medicine, but their "black box" nature hinders broader adoption. We propose a framework for gradient-based explanation methods tailored to survival neural networks, extending their use beyond regression and classification. We analyze the implications of their theoretical assumptions for time-dependent explanations in the survival setting and propose effective visualizations incorporating the temporal dimension. Experiments on synthetic data show that gradient-based methods capture the magnitude and direction of local and global feature effects, including time dependencies. We introduce GradSHAP(t), a gradient-based counterpart to SurvSHAP(t), which outperforms SurvSHAP(t) and SurvLIME in a computational speed vs. accuracy trade-off. Finally, we apply these methods to medical data with multi-modal inputs, revealing relevant tabular features and visual patterns, as well as their temporal dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerrit J. J. van den Burg, Gen Suzuki, Wei Liu, Murat Sensoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated judges to evaluate recommendation systems, search engines, and other subjective tasks, where relying on human evaluators can be costly, time-consuming, and unscalable. LLMs offer an efficient solution for continuous, automated evaluation. However, since the systems that are built and improved with these judgments are ultimately designed for human use, it is crucial that LLM judgments align closely with human evaluators to ensure such systems remain human-centered. On the other hand, aligning LLM judgments with human evaluators is challenging due to individual variability and biases in human judgments. We propose a simple yet effective framework to align LLM judgments with individual human evaluators or their aggregated judgments, without retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. Our approach learns a linear mapping between the LLM's outputs and human judgments, achieving over 142% average improvement in agreement across 29 tasks with only a small number of calibration examples used for training. Notably, our method works in zero-shot and few-shot settings, exceeds inter-human agreement on four out of six tasks, and enables smaller LLMs to achieve performance comparable to that of larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixin Zhang, Zongqi Wan, Yu Yang, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Coordinating multiple agents to collaboratively maximize submodular functions in unpredictable environments is a critical task with numerous applications in machine learning, robot planning and control. The existing approaches, such as the OSG algorithm, are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees and the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address these challenges, we firstly present a $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which employs the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular maximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to reduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques. Moreover, $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid sub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive projection operations in $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a projection-free $\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL divergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that both algorithms achieve a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\beta}})$ against a $(\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where $C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\beta$ is the spectral gap of the network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives. This result significantly improves the $(\frac{1}{1+c})$-approximation provided by the state-of-the-art OSG algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through simulation-based multi-target tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gawoon Ban, Hyeongjun Kim, Seokjun Choi, Seungwoo Yoon, Seung-Hwan Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Display photometric stereo uses a display as a programmable light source to illuminate a scene with diverse illumination conditions. Recently, differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated improved normal reconstruction accuracy by using learned display patterns. However, DDPS faced limitations in practicality, requiring a fixed desktop imaging setup using a polarization camera and a desktop-scale monitor. In this paper, we propose a more practical physics-based photometric stereo, differentiable mobile display photometric stereo (DMDPS), that leverages a mobile phone consisting of a display and a camera. We overcome the limitations of using a mobile device by developing a mobile app and method that simultaneously displays patterns and captures high-quality HDR images. Using this technique, we capture real-world 3D-printed objects and learn display patterns via a differentiable learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDPS on both a 3D printed dataset and a first dataset of fallen leaves. The leaf dataset contains reconstructed surface normals and albedos of fallen leaves that may enable future research beyond computer graphics and vision. We believe that DMDPS takes a step forward for practical physics-based photometric stereo.</p>

This paper aims to bridge these research streams by demonstrating that functions constructed through repeated composition of non-linear functions are noise sensitive under general product measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuyuan Hu, Guoqing Liu, Can Chen, Yang Zhao, Hao Zhang, Xue Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Structure-based drug discovery, encompassing the tasks of protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, represents a core challenge in drug discovery. However, no existing work can deal with both tasks to effectively leverage the duality between them, and current methods for each task are hindered by challenges in modeling 3D information and the limitations of available data. To address these issues, we propose 3DMolFormer, a unified dual-channel transformer-based framework applicable to both docking and 3D drug design tasks, which exploits their duality by utilizing docking functionalities within the drug design process. Specifically, we represent 3D pocket-ligand complexes using parallel sequences of discrete tokens and continuous numbers, and we design a corresponding dual-channel transformer model to handle this format, thereby overcoming the challenges of 3D information modeling. Additionally, we alleviate data limitations through large-scale pre-training on a mixed dataset, followed by supervised and reinforcement learning fine-tuning techniques respectively tailored for the two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DMolFormer outperforms previous approaches in both protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, highlighting its promising application in structure-based drug discovery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhi Yu, Yuchen Liu, Zhaohui Yang, Haijian Sun, Mingzhe Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an accurate synchronization between a physical network and its digital network twin (DNT), which serves as a virtual representation of the physical network. The considered network includes a set of base stations (BSs) that must allocate its limited spectrum resources to serve a set of users while also transmitting its partially observed physical network information to a cloud server to generate the DNT. Since the DNT can predict the physical network status based on its historical status, the BSs may not need to send their physical network information at each time slot, allowing them to conserve spectrum resources to serve the users. However, if the DNT does not receive the physical network information of the BSs over a large time period, the DNT's accuracy in representing the physical network may degrade. To this end, each BS must decide when to send the physical network information to the cloud server to update the DNT, while also determining the spectrum resource allocation policy for both DNT synchronization and serving the users. We formulate this resource allocation task as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total data rate of all users while minimizing the asynchronization between the physical network and the DNT. To address this problem, we propose a method based on the GRUs and the value decomposition network (VDN). Simulation results show that our GRU and VDN based algorithm improves the weighted sum of data rates and the similarity between the status of the DNT and the physical network by up to 28.96%, compared to a baseline method combining GRU with the independent Q learning.</p>

In this paper, we investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to find improved heuristics. We use funsearch, a genetic programming variant based on code generation by a Large Language Model, in order to explore possible approaches, then use strongly typed genetic programming to zero in on useful solutions. Both approaches manage to re-discover the state-of-the-art heuristics recently incorporated into integration-by-parts solvers, and in one example find a small advance on this state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnny Xi, Hugh Dance, Peter Orbanz, Benjamin Bloem-Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Bivariate structural causal models (SCM) are often used to infer causal direction by examining their goodness-of-fit under restricted model classes. In this paper, we describe a parametrization of bivariate SCMs in terms of a causal velocity by viewing the cause variable as time in a dynamical system. The velocity implicitly defines counterfactual curves via the solution of initial value problems where the observation specifies the initial condition. Using tools from measure transport, we obtain a unique correspondence between SCMs and the score function of the generated distribution via its causal velocity. Based on this, we derive an objective function that directly regresses the velocity against the score function, the latter of which can be estimated non-parametrically from observational data. We use this to develop a method for bivariate causal discovery that extends beyond known model classes such as additive or location scale noise, and that requires no assumptions on the noise distributions. When the score is estimated well, the objective is also useful for detecting model non-identifiability and misspecification. We present positive results in simulation and benchmark experiments where many existing methods fail, and perform ablation studies to examine the method's sensitivity to accurate score estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quantification of audio aesthetics remains a complex challenge in audio processing, primarily due to its subjective nature, which is influenced by human perception and cultural context. Traditional methods often depend on human listeners for evaluation, leading to inconsistencies and high resource demands. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of predicting audio aesthetics without human intervention. Such systems are crucial for applications like data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets, and evaluating generative audio models, especially as these models become more sophisticated. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to audio aesthetic evaluation by proposing new annotation guidelines that decompose human listening perspectives into four distinct axes. We develop and train no-reference, per-item prediction models that offer a more nuanced assessment of audio quality. Our models are evaluated against human mean opinion scores (MOS) and existing methods, demonstrating comparable or superior performance. This research not only advances the field of audio aesthetics but also provides open-source models and datasets to facilitate future work and benchmarking.

Recently, a plethora of new AI models and tools has been proposed, promising to empower researchers and academics worldwide to conduct their research more effectively and efficiently. This includes all aspects of the research cycle, especially (1) searching for relevant literature; (2) generating research ideas and conducting experimentation; generating (3) text-based and (4) multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and diagrams); and (5) AI-based automatic peer review. In this survey, we provide an in-depth overview over these exciting recent developments, which promise to fundamentally alter the scientific research process for good. Our survey covers the five aspects outlined above, indicating relevant datasets, methods and results (including evaluation) as well as limitations and scope for future research. Ethical concerns regarding shortcomings of these tools and potential for misuse (fake science, plagiarism, harms to research integrity) take a particularly prominent place in our discussion.

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for guardrail models to ensure responsible use, particularly in detecting unsafe and illegal content. While substantial safety data exist in English, multilingual guardrail modeling remains underexplored due to the scarcity of open-source safety data in other languages. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where a generator and a guardrail model co-evolve adversarially to produce high-quality synthetic data for multilingual guardrail training. We theoretically formalize this interaction as a two-player game, proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations show that our model \ours outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving nearly 10% improvement over LlamaGuard3 (8B) on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a significantly smaller model (0.5B). We achieve substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks, particularly in addressing the imbalance for lower-resource languages in a collected real dataset. Ablation studies emphasize the critical role of synthetic data generation in bridging the imbalance in open-source data between English and other languages. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach to synthetic data generation, paving the way for improved multilingual guardrail models to enhance LLM safety.

This paper introduces new equivariant neural networks that preserve symmetry while maintaining a comparable number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per parameter to standard non-equivariant networks. We focus on horizontal mirroring (flopping) invariance, common in many computer vision tasks. The main idea is to parametrize the feature spaces in terms of mirror-symmetric and mirror-antisymmetric features, i.e., irreps of the flopping group. This decomposes the linear layers to be block-diagonal, requiring half the number of FLOPs. Our approach reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, providing a practical solution for efficient, scalable symmetry-aware architectures.</p>

The big data era demands analysis of long-range spatial and long-term temporal dependencies in large collections of raw data, rendering neural networks an attractive solution for density estimation. In this paper, we exploit the concept of copula to explicitly build an estimate of the probability density function associated to any observed data. In particular, we separate univariate marginal distributions from the joint dependence structure in the data, the copula itself, and we model the latter with a neural network-based method referred to as copula density neural estimation (CODINE). Results show that the novel learning approach is capable of modeling complex distributions and it can be applied for mutual information estimation and data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecule pretraining has quickly become the go-to schema to boost the performance of AI-based drug discovery. Naturally, molecules can be represented as 2D topological graphs or 3D geometric point clouds. Although most existing pertaining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE. MoleculeSDE leverages group symmetric (e.g., SE(3)-equivariant and reflection-antisymmetric) stochastic differential equation models to generate the 3D geometries from 2D topologies, and vice versa, directly in the input space. It not only obtains tighter MI bound but also enables prosperous downstream tasks than the previous work. By comparing with 17 pretraining baselines, we empirically verify that MoleculeSDE can learn an expressive representation with state-of-the-art performance on 26 out of 32 downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhou Liu, Ching-Wen Lee, Xinwei Sun, Yu Qiao, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning the decision-making process of machine learning algorithms with that of experienced radiologists is crucial for reliable diagnosis. While existing methods have attempted to align their diagnosis behaviors to those of radiologists reflected in the training data, this alignment is primarily associational rather than causal, resulting in pseudo-correlations that may not transfer well. In this paper, we propose a causality-based alignment framework towards aligning the model's decision process with that of experts. Specifically, we first employ counterfactual generation to identify the causal chain of model decisions. To align this causal chain with that of experts, we propose a causal alignment loss that enforces the model to focus on causal factors underlying each decision step in the whole causal chain. To optimize this loss that involves the counterfactual generator as an implicit function of the model's parameters, we employ the implicit function theorem equipped with the conjugate gradient method for efficient estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two medical diagnosis applications, showcasing faithful alignment to radiologists.</p>

Relax also introduces first-class symbolic shape annotations to track dynamic shape computations globally across the program, enabling dynamic shape-aware cross-level optimizations. We build an end-to-end compilation framework using the proposed approach to optimize dynamic shape models.

However, the former would fail for the unknown shift beyond simple statistics, while the latter has limited compatibility on different forecasting models. To overcome these problems, we first propose a decoupled formulation for time series forecasting, with no reliance on fixed statistics and no restriction on forecasting architectures. This formulation regards the removing-shift procedure as a special transformation between a raw distribution and a desired target distribution and separates it from the forecasting. Such a formulation is further formalized into a bi-level optimization problem, to enable the joint learning of the transformation (outer loop) and forecasting (inner loop). Moreover, the special requirements of expressiveness and bi-direction for the transformation motivate us to propose instance normalization flow (IN-Flow), a novel invertible network for time series transformation. Different from the classic "normalizing flow" models, IN-Flow does not aim for normalizing input to the prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution) for generation, but creatively transforms time series distribution by stacking normalization layers and flow-based invertible networks, which is thus named "normalization" flow. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti</p>
<p>Abstract: We study online learning in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with adversarial losses and stochastic hard constraints, under bandit feedback. We consider three scenarios. In the first one, we address general CMDPs, where we design an algorithm attaining sublinear regret and cumulative positive constraints violation. In the second scenario, under the mild assumption that a policy strictly satisfying the constraints exists and is known to the learner, we design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while ensuring that constraints are satisfied at every episode with high probability. In the last scenario, we only assume the existence of a strictly feasible policy, which is not known to the learner, and we design an algorithm attaining sublinear regret and constant cumulative positive constraints violation. Finally, we show that in the last two scenarios, a dependence on the Slater's parameter is unavoidable. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study CMDPs involving both adversarial losses and hard constraints. Thus, our algorithms can deal with general non-stationary environments subject to requirements much stricter than those manageable with existing ones, enabling their adoption in a much wider range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masih Eskandar, Tooba Imtiaz, Zifeng Wang, Jennifer Dy</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep models, including Vision Transformers, is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many existing defenses against these attacks, such as adversarial training, rely on full-model fine-tuning to induce robustness in the models. These defenses require storing a copy of the entire model, that can have billions of parameters, for each task. At the same time, parameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer-based models to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this paper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for downstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous adversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer from gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We introduce ADAPT, a novel framework for performing adaptive adversarial training in the prompt tuning paradigm. Our method achieves competitive robust accuracy of ~40% w.r.t. SOTA robustness methods using full-model fine-tuning, by tuning only ~1% of the number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillem Simeon, Antonio Mirarchi, Raul P. Pelaez, Raimondas Galvelis, Gianni De Fabritiis</p>
<p>Abstract: Most state-of-the-art neural network potentials do not account for molecular attributes other than atomic numbers and positions, which limits its range of applicability by design. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of including additional electronic attributes in neural network potential representations with a minimal architectural change to TensorNet, a state-of-the-art equivariant model based on Cartesian rank-2 tensor representations. By performing experiments on both custom-made and public benchmarking datasets, we show that this modification resolves the input degeneracy issues stemming from the use of atomic numbers and positions alone, while enhancing the model's predictive accuracy across diverse chemical systems with different charge or spin states. This is accomplished without tailored strategies or the inclusion of physics-based energy terms, while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. These findings should furthermore encourage researchers to train and use models incorporating these additional representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning has recently attracted significant interest in drug discovery, with a recent, fast-growing literature mostly involving convoluted meta-learning strategies. We revisit the more straightforward fine-tuning approach for molecular data, and propose a regularized quadratic-probe loss based on the the Mahalanobis distance. We design a dedicated block-coordinate descent optimizer, which avoid the degenerate solutions of our loss. Interestingly, our simple fine-tuning approach achieves highly competitive performances in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being applicable to black-box settings and removing the need for specific episodic pre-training strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to assess the robustness of the competing methods to domain shifts. In this setting, our fine-tuning baseline obtains consistently better results than meta-learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Lu, Shengran Hu, Jeff Clune</p>
<p>Abstract: Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration (i.e., determine which states to save and explore from, and what actions to consider next), which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these handcrafted heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant pretrained foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g., discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries -- states encountered during exploration that are valuable in terms of exploration, yet where what makes them interesting was not anticipated by the human user. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse range of language and vision-based tasks that require search and exploration. Across these tasks, IGE strongly exceeds classic reinforcement learning and graph search baselines, and also succeeds where prior state-of-the-art FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, Intelligent Go-Explore combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R Wessels, David M Knigge, Samuele Papa, Riccardo Valperga, Sharvaree Vadgama, Efstratios Gavves, Erik J Bekkers</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) are increasingly being leveraged as continuous signal representations, by associating each data-sample with a latent variable that conditions a shared backbone Neural Field (NeF) to reconstruct the sample. However, existing CNF architectures face limitations when using this latent downstream in tasks requiring fine-grained geometric reasoning, such as classification and segmentation. We posit that this results from lack of explicit modelling of geometric information (e.g., locality in the signal or the orientation of a feature) in the latent space of CNFs. As such, we propose Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel CNF architecture which uses a geometry-informed cross-attention to condition the NeF on a geometric variable--a latent point cloud of features--that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. We show that this approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws: if the field transforms, the latent representation transforms accordingly--and vice versa. Crucially, this equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faithfully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, and (2) weight-sharing over similar local patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. We validate these main properties in a range of tasks including classification, segmentation, forecasting, reconstruction and generative modelling, showing clear improvement over baselines with a geometry-free latent space.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Zhao, Masatoshi Uehara, Gabriele Scalia, Sunyuan Kung, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine, Ehsan Hajiramezanali</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyl18/CTRL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data created by differentially private (DP) generative models is increasingly used in real-world settings. In this context, PATE-GAN has emerged as one of the most popular algorithms, combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the private training approach of PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles).
  In this paper, we set out to reproduce the utility evaluation from the original PATE-GAN paper, compare available implementations, and conduct a privacy audit. More precisely, we analyze and benchmark six open-source PATE-GAN implementations, including three by (a subset of) the original authors. First, we shed light on architecture deviations and empirically demonstrate that none reproduce the utility performance reported in the original paper. We then present an in-depth privacy evaluation, which includes DP auditing, and show that all implementations leak more privacy than intended. Furthermore, we uncover 19 privacy violations and 5 other bugs in these six open-source implementations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Bahlous-Boldi, Li Ding, Lee Spector, Scott Niekum</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring AI models align with human values is essential for their safety and functionality. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preferences to achieve this alignment. However, when preferences are sourced from diverse populations, point estimates of reward can result in suboptimal performance or be unfair to specific groups. We propose Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL), which enables pluralistic alignment by framing discrepant group preferences as objectives with potential trade-offs, aiming for policies that are Pareto-optimal on the preference dataset. POPL utilizes lexicase selection, an iterative process that selects diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. Our theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that POPL surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions and policies, effectively catering to distinct groups without access to group numbers or membership labels. We verify the performance of POPL on a stateless preference learning setting, a Minigrid RL domain, Metaworld robotics benchmarks, as well as large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. We illustrate that POPL can also serve as a foundation for techniques optimizing specific notions of group fairness, ensuring safe and equitable AI model alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonatan Sverdlov, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that such models can separate generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs, though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However, these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application, every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.
  This paper shows that generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs can be separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, EGENNET, which achieves our theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on synthetic and chemical benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangqiang Li, M. Amine Atoui, Xiangshun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization achieves fault diagnosis on unseen modes. In process industrial systems, fault samples are limited, and it is quite common that the available fault data are from a single mode. Extracting domain-invariant features from single-mode data for unseen mode fault diagnosis poses challenges. Existing methods utilize a generator module to simulate samples of unseen modes. However, multi-mode samples contain complex spatiotemporal information, which brings significant difficulties to accurate sample generation. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a dual adversarial and contrastive network (DACN) for single-source domain generalization in fault diagnosis. The main idea of DACN is to generate diverse sample features and extract domain-invariant feature representations. An adversarial pseudo-sample feature generation strategy is developed to create fake unseen mode sample features with sufficient semantic information and diversity, leveraging adversarial learning between the feature transformer and domain-invariant feature extractor. An enhanced domain-invariant feature extraction strategy is designed to capture common feature representations across multi-modes, utilizing contrastive learning and adversarial learning between the domain-invariant feature extractor and the discriminator. Experiments on the Tennessee Eastman process and continuous stirred-tank reactor demonstrate that DACN achieves high classification accuracy on unseen modes while maintaining a small model size.</p>

To address this challenge, a novel generative model, termed the State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is proposed for data-driven assimilation. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the true posterior distribution under mild assumptions, suggesting its theoretical advantages over previous score-based approaches. Experimental results also indicate that SOAD may offer improved performance compared to existing data-driven methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by automatically generating code from natural language. Yet challenges remain in generating fully correct code that aligns with user intent. Our study reveals that LLMs tend to pay less attention to user prompts as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize that this attention dilution issue is an important reason for code generation errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA) to guide code LLMs to pay more attention to user intent when generating code. We evaluate SPA using six base LLMs across six benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPA enhances Pass@1 by up to 12.9%, consistently outperforming SOTA code generation methods in all settings.

However, many existing approaches use relatively straightforward aggregating schemes that may not fully capture the complex dynamics present between different modalities.

This integration aims to capture complex intermodal interactions more effectively. Unlike previous models, our approach is specifically designed to model and leverage the intricacies of these relationships, enabling a more faithful representation of multimodal data. Our experiments demonstrate that our model performs competitively on the standard PolyMNIST dataset and shows superior performance in managing complex intermodal dependencies in a specially designed synthetic dataset, intended to test intricate relationships.</p>

<p>Abstract: The loss functions of many learning problems contain multiple additive terms that can disagree and yield conflicting update directions. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics equations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly difficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed by PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by ensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific gradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms and dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We additionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the back-propagation of different loss terms. We provide a mathematical proof showing the convergence of the ConFIG method, and it is evaluated across a range of challenging PINN scenarios. ConFIG consistently shows superior performance and runtime compared to baseline methods. We also test the proposed method in a classic multi-task benchmark, where the ConFIG method likewise exhibits a highly promising performance.

<p>Abstract: Causal machine learning (ML) holds promise for estimating individual treatment effects from complex data. For successful real-world applications using machine learning methods, it is of paramount importance to obtain reliable insights into which variables drive heterogeneity in the response to treatment. We propose PermuCATE, an algorithm based on the Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) method, for statistically rigorous global variable importance assessment in the estimation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Theoretical analysis of the finite sample regime and empirical studies show that PermuCATE has lower variance than the Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) reference method and provides a reliable measure of variable importance. This property increases statistical power, which is crucial for causal inference in the limited-data regime common to biomedical applications. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of PermuCATE in simulated and real-world health datasets, including settings with up to hundreds of correlated variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayan Maiti, Michelle Michelle, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d+10887$ unique nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of unique nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous real-world applications. Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD without label supervision. Despite many OD techniques are available to choose from, algorithm and hyperparameter selection remain challenging for OD, limiting its effective use in practice. In this paper, we present FoMo-0D, a pre-trained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which bypasses the hurdle of model selection. To overcome the difficulty of labeled data collection, FoMo-0D is trained on synthetic data and can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of test samples without parameter fine-tuning -- making the need obsolete for choosing an algorithm/architecture and tuning its associated hyperparameters when given a new OD dataset. Extensive experiments on 57 real-world datasets against 26 baselines show that FoMo-0D significantly outperforms the vast majority of the baselines and is statistically no different from the 2nd best method, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per sample, offering at least 7x speed-up compared to previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexius Wadell, Anoushka Bhutani, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in molecular design and materials science. However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers which capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirty tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, for their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation language, revealing significant gaps. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by training and fine-tuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics. The proposed tokenizer framework systematically integrates nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; this facilitates applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01803">On the expressiveness and spectral bias of KANs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Wang, Jonathan W. Siegel, Ziming Liu, Thomas Y. Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) \cite{liu2024kan} were very recently proposed as a potential alternative to the prevalent architectural backbone of many deep learning models, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). KANs have seen success in various tasks of AI for science, with their empirical efficiency and accuracy demostrated in function regression, PDE solving, and many more scientific problems.
  In this article, we revisit the comparison of KANs and MLPs, with emphasis on a theoretical perspective. On the one hand, we compare the representation and approximation capabilities of KANs and MLPs. We establish that MLPs can be represented using KANs of a comparable size. This shows that the approximation and representation capabilities of KANs are at least as good as MLPs. Conversely, we show that KANs can be represented using MLPs, but that in this representation the number of parameters increases by a factor of the KAN grid size. This suggests that KANs with a large grid size may be more efficient than MLPs at approximating certain functions. On the other hand, from the perspective of learning and optimization, we study the spectral bias of KANs compared with MLPs. We demonstrate that KANs are less biased toward low frequencies than MLPs. We highlight that the multi-level learning feature specific to KANs, i.e. grid extension of splines, improves the learning process for high-frequency components. Detailed comparisons with different choices of depth, width, and grid sizes of KANs are made, shedding some light on how to choose the hyperparameters in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Anna Lunghi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti</p>
<p>Abstract: We study online learning in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) in which rewards and constraints may be either stochastic or adversarial. In such settings, Stradi et al.(2024) proposed the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm able to seamlessly handle stochastic and adversarial constraints, achieving optimal regret and constraint violation bounds in both cases. This algorithm suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it only works under full feedback, which severely limits its applicability in practice. Moreover, it relies on optimizing over the space of occupancy measures, which requires solving convex optimization problems, an highly inefficient task. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with bandit feedback. Specifically, when the constraints are stochastic, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation, while, when they are adversarial, it attains $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation and a tight fraction of the optimal reward. Moreover, our algorithm is based on a policy optimization approach, which is much more efficient than occupancy-measure-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiecheng Lu, Xu Han, Yan Sun, Shihao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varing gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cabrel Teguemne Fokam, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Lukas K\"onig, David Kappel, Anand Subramoney</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training across multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed data-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization overheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a result of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays due to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the backpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the interlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do not take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the forward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called Partial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses separate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates and allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise (partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces parameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to $5.95\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of delays, and up to $2.14\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by achieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the gradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binghui Li, Yuanzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training is a widely-applied approach to training deep neural networks to be robust against adversarial perturbation. However, although adversarial training has achieved empirical success in practice, it still remains unclear why adversarial examples exist and how adversarial training methods improve model robustness. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of adversarial examples and adversarial training algorithms from the perspective of feature learning theory. Specifically, we focus on a multiple classification setting, where the structured data can be composed of two types of features: the robust features, which are resistant to perturbation but sparse, and the non-robust features, which are susceptible to perturbation but dense. We train a two-layer smoothed ReLU convolutional neural network to learn our structured data. First, we prove that by using standard training (gradient descent over the empirical risk), the network learner primarily learns the non-robust feature rather than the robust feature, which thereby leads to the adversarial examples that are generated by perturbations aligned with negative non-robust feature directions. Then, we consider the gradient-based adversarial training algorithm, which runs gradient ascent to find adversarial examples and runs gradient descent over the empirical risk at adversarial examples to update models. We show that the adversarial training method can provably strengthen the robust feature learning and suppress the non-robust feature learning to improve the network robustness. Finally, we also empirically validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-image datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Mosbach, Jan Niklas Ewertz, Angel Villar-Corrales, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a latent dynamics model provides a task-agnostic representation of an agent's understanding of its environment. Leveraging this knowledge for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) holds the potential to improve sample efficiency over model-free methods by learning from imagined rollouts. Furthermore, because the latent space serves as input to behavior models, the informative representations learned by the world model facilitate efficient learning of desired skills. Most existing methods rely on holistic representations of the environment's state. In contrast, humans reason about objects and their interactions, predicting how actions will affect specific parts of their surroundings. Inspired by this, we propose Slot-Attention for Object-centric Latent Dynamics (SOLD), a novel model-based RL algorithm that learns object-centric dynamics models in an unsupervised manner from pixel inputs. We demonstrate that the structured latent space not only improves model interpretability but also provides a valuable input space for behavior models to reason over. Our results show that SOLD outperforms DreamerV3 and TD-MPC2 - state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms - across a range of benchmark robotic environments that require relational reasoning and manipulation capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aghyad Deeb, Fabien Roger</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models' knowledge of how to perform cyber-security attacks, create bioweapons, and manipulate humans poses risks of misuse. Previous work has proposed methods to unlearn this knowledge. Historically, it has been unclear whether unlearning techniques are removing information from the model weights or just making it harder to access. To disentangle these two objectives, we propose an adversarial evaluation method to test for the removal of information from model weights: we give an attacker access to some facts that were supposed to be removed, and using those, the attacker tries to recover other facts from the same distribution that cannot be guessed from the accessible facts. We show that using fine-tuning on the accessible facts can recover 88% of the pre-unlearning accuracy when applied to current unlearning methods for information learned during pretraining, revealing the limitations of these methods in removing information from the model weights. Our results also suggest that unlearning evaluations that measure unlearning robustness on information learned during an additional fine-tuning phase may overestimate robustness compared to evaluations that attempt to unlearn information learned during pretraining.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10572">Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Avrim Blum, Donya Saless</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Deschenaux, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale, diffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokendra Poudel, Sushant Jha, Ryan Meeker, Duy-Nhat Phan, Rahul Bhowmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) employs ultrasonic welding to bond similar or dissimilar metal foils to a substrate, resulting in solid, consolidated metal components. However, certain processing conditions can lead to inter-layer defects, affecting the final product's quality. This study develops a method to monitor in-process quality using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN models were evaluated on their ability to classify samples with and without embedded thermocouples across five power levels (300W, 600W, 900W, 1200W, 1500W) using thermal images with supervised labeling. Four distinct CNN classification models were created for different scenarios including without (baseline) and with thermocouples, only without thermocouples across power levels, only with thermocouples across power levels, and combined without and with thermocouples across power levels. The models achieved 98.29% accuracy on combined baseline and thermocouple images, 97.10% for baseline images across power levels, 97.43% for thermocouple images, and 97.27% for both types across power levels. The high accuracy, above 97%, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in identifying and classifying conditions within the UAM process, providing a reliable tool for quality assurance and process control in manufacturing environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-context learning allows models like transformers to adapt to new tasks from a few examples without updating their weights, a desirable trait for reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing in-context RL methods, such as Algorithm Distillation (AD), demand large, carefully curated datasets and can be unstable and costly to train due to the transient nature of in-context learning abilities. In this work, we integrated the n-gram induction heads into transformers for in-context RL. By incorporating these n-gram attention patterns, we considerably reduced the amount of data required for generalization and eased the training process by making models less sensitive to hyperparameters. Our approach matches, and in some cases surpasses, the performance of AD in both grid-world and pixel-based environments, suggesting that n-gram induction heads could improve the efficiency of in-context RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) underpin many scientific phenomena, yet traditional computational approaches often struggle with complex, nonlinear systems and irregular geometries.

AMG leverages advanced graph-based techniques and dynamic attention mechanisms within a novel GraphFormer architecture, enabling precise management of diverse spatial domains and complex data interdependencies. By constructing multi-scale graphs to handle variable feature frequencies and a physics graph to encapsulate inherent physical properties, AMG significantly outperforms previous methods, which are typically limited to uniform grids. We present a comprehensive evaluation of AMG across six benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art models.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have witnessed the emergence of large-scale deep learning models capable of interpreting and generating both textual and imaging data. Such models, typically referred to as foundation models, are trained on extensive corpora of unlabeled data and demonstrate high performance across various tasks. Foundation models have recently received extensive attention from academic, industry, and regulatory bodies. Given the potentially transformative impact that foundation models can have on the field of radiology, this review aims to establish a standardized terminology concerning foundation models, with a specific focus on the requirements of training data, model training paradigms, model capabilities, and evaluation strategies. We further outline potential pathways to facilitate the training of radiology-specific foundation models, with a critical emphasis on elucidating both the benefits and challenges associated with such models. Overall, we envision that this review can unify technical advances and clinical needs in the training of foundation models for radiology in a safe and responsible manner, for ultimately benefiting patients, providers, and radiologists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiheng Zhang, Zichen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Network interference has attracted significant attention in the field of causal inference, encapsulating various sociological behaviors where the treatment assigned to one individual within a network may affect the outcomes of others, such as their neighbors. A key challenge in this setting is that standard causal inference methods often assume independent treatment effects among individuals, which may not hold in networked environments. To estimate interference-aware causal effects, a traditional approach is to inherit the independent settings, where practitioners randomly assign experimental participants into different groups and compare their outcomes. While effective in offline settings, this strategy becomes problematic in sequential experiments, where suboptimal decision persists, leading to substantial regret. To address this issue, we introduce a unified interference-aware framework for online experimental design. Compared to existing studies, we extend the definition of arm space by utilizing the statistical concept of exposure mapping, which allows for a more flexible and context-aware representation of treatment effects in networked settings. Crucially, we establish a Pareto-optimal trade-off between estimation accuracy and regret under the network concerning both time period and arm space, which remains superior to baseline models even without network interference. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic implementation and discuss its generalization across different learning settings and network topology</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kale-ab Abebe Tessera, Arrasy Rahman, Stefano V. Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptability is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents must learn specialised or homogeneous behaviours for diverse tasks. While parameter sharing methods are sample-efficient, they often encounter gradient interference among agents, limiting their behavioural diversity. Conversely, non-parameter sharing approaches enable specialisation, but are computationally demanding and sample-inefficient. To address these issues, we propose HyperMARL, a parameter sharing approach that uses hypernetworks to dynamically generate agent-specific actor and critic parameters, without altering the learning objective or requiring preset diversity levels. By decoupling observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, HyperMARL empirically reduces policy gradient variance and facilitates specialisation within FuPS, suggesting it can mitigate cross-agent interference. Across multiple MARL benchmarks involving up to twenty agents -- and requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours -- HyperMARL consistently performs competitively with fully shared, non-parameter-sharing, and diversity-promoting baselines, all while preserving a behavioural diversity level comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish hypernetworks as a versatile approach for MARL across diverse environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The challenge of balancing fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, especially when sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age are considered, has motivated substantial research in recent years. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain consistent across counterfactual variations of sensitive attributes, which is a crucial concept in addressing societal biases. However, existing counterfactual fairness approaches usually overlook intrinsic information about sensitive features, limiting their ability to achieve fairness while simultaneously maintaining performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce EXOgenous Causal reasoning (EXOC), a novel causal reasoning framework motivated by exogenous variables. It leverages auxiliary variables to uncover intrinsic properties that give rise to sensitive attributes. Our framework explicitly defines an auxiliary node and a control node that contribute to counterfactual fairness and control the information flow within the model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muru Zhang, Mayank Mishra, Zhongzhu Zhou, William Brandon, Jue Wang, Yoon Kim, Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, Shuaiwen Leon Song, Ben Athiwaratkun, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model inference is both memory-intensive and time-consuming, often requiring distributed algorithms to efficiently scale. Various model parallelism strategies are used in multi-gpu training and inference to partition computation across multiple devices, reducing memory load and computation time. However, using model parallelism necessitates communication of information between GPUs, which has been a major bottleneck and limits the gains obtained by scaling up the number of devices. We introduce Ladder Residual, a simple architectural modification applicable to all residual-based models that enables straightforward overlapping that effectively hides the latency of communication. Our insight is that in addition to systems optimization, one can also redesign the model architecture to decouple communication from computation. While Ladder Residual can allow communication-computation decoupling in conventional parallelism patterns, we focus on Tensor Parallelism in this paper, which is particularly bottlenecked by its heavy communication. For a Transformer model with 70B parameters, applying Ladder Residual to all its layers can achieve 29% end-to-end wall clock speed up at inference time with TP sharding over 8 devices. We refer the resulting Transformer model as the Ladder Transformer. We train a 1B and 3B Ladder Transformer from scratch and observe comparable performance to a standard dense transformer baseline. We also show that it is possible to convert parts of the Llama-3.1 8B model to our Ladder Residual architecture with minimal accuracy degradation by only retraining for 3B tokens. We release our code for training and inference for easier replication of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about distinguishing AI-generated text from human content. Existing watermarking techniques, like \kgw, struggle with low watermark strength and stringent false-positive requirements. Our analysis reveals that current methods rely on coarse estimates of non-watermarked text, limiting watermark detectability. To address this, we propose Bipolar Watermark (\tool), which splits generated text into positive and negative poles, enhancing detection without requiring additional computational resources or knowledge of the prompt. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate \tool's effectiveness and compatibility with existing optimization techniques, providing a new optimization dimension for watermarking in LLM-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenjia Bai, Yang Zhang, Shuang Qiu, Qiaosheng Zhang, Kang Xu, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage, and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \emph{how to explore} for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named \emph{Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO)}, which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria-Florina Balcan, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Dravyansh Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshihiro Mitsuka, Shadan Golestan, Zahin Sufiyan, Sheila Schoepp, Shotaro Miwa, Osmar R. Zaiane</p>
<p>Abstract: The scheme of adaptation via meta-learning is seen as an ingredient for solving the problem of data shortage or distribution shift in real-world applications, but it also brings the new risk of inappropriate updates of the model in the user environment, which increases the demand for explainability. Among the various types of XAI methods, establishing a method of explanation based on past experience in meta-learning requires special consideration due to its bi-level structure of training, which has been left unexplored. In this work, we propose influence functions for explaining meta-learning that measure the sensitivities of training tasks to adaptation and inference. We also argue that the approximation of the Hessian using the Gauss-Newton matrix resolves computational barriers peculiar to meta-learning. We demonstrate the adequacy of the method through experiments on task distinction and task distribution distinction using image classification tasks with MAML and Prototypical Network.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishal Thapaliya, Esra Akbas, Ram Sapkota, Bhaskar Ray, Vince Calhoun, Jingyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers valuable insights into the human brain's functional organization and is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes, as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli. In this study, we introduce a novel attention mechanism for graphs with subnetworks, named Self-Clustering Graph Transformer (SCGT), designed to handle the issue of uniform node updates in graph transformers. By using static functional connectivity (FC) correlation features as input to the transformer model, SCGT effectively captures the sub-network structure of the brain by performing cluster-specific updates to the nodes, unlike uniform node updates in vanilla graph transformers, further allowing us to learn and interpret the subclusters. We validate our approach on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, comprising 7,957 participants, for the prediction of total cognitive score and gender classification. Our results demonstrate that SCGT outperforms the vanilla graph transformer method and other recent models, offering a promising tool for modeling brain functional connectivity and interpreting the underlying subnetwork structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seffi Cohen, Niv Goldshlager, Nurit Cohen-Inger, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but often struggle to excel uniformly in diverse or complex domains. We propose a novel ensemble method - Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to achieve more robust performance. Our approach involves: (1) clustering models based on response "fingerprints" patterns, (2) applying a quantile-based filtering mechanism to remove underperforming models at a per-subject level, and (3) assigning adaptive weights to remaining models based on their subject-wise validation accuracy. In experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, DFPE outperforms the best single model by 3% overall accuracy and 5% in discipline-level accuracy. This method increases the robustness and generalization of LLMs and underscores how model selection, diversity preservation, and performance-driven weighting can effectively address challenging, multi-faceted language understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devansh Bhardwaj, Naman Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Fingerprinting refers to the process of identifying underlying Machine Learning (ML) models of AI Systemts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), by analyzing their unique characteristics or patterns, much like a human fingerprint. The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Seo, Ferhat Ozgur Catak, Chunming Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01659">Longer Attention Span: Increasing Transformer Context Length with Sparse Graph Processing Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Tomczak, Sanmukh Kuppannagari</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated great success in numerous domains including natural language processing and bioinformatics. This success stems from the use of the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate pairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However, the primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time complexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence over which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the length of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive research has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to sub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into the attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks. However, efficient implementations that achieve "true sparsity" are lacking.
  In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of attention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention mask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph processing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms only perform the needed computations, i.e., they are work optimal. We also perform extensive experimentation using popular attention masks to explore the impact of sparsity on execution time and achievable context length. Our experiments demonstrate significant speedups in execution times compared to state-of-the-art attention implementations such as FlashAttention for large sequence lengths. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are able to achieve extremely long sequence lengths of as high as 160 million on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (SXM4 80GB).</p>

<p>Abstract: Although deep models have been widely explored in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), previous works are primarily limited to data only with up to tens of thousands of mesh points, far from the million-point scale required by industrial simulations that involve complex geometries. In the spirit of advancing neural PDE solvers to real industrial applications, we present Transolver++, a highly parallel and efficient neural solver that can accurately solve PDEs on million-scale geometries. Building upon previous advancements in solving PDEs by learning physical states via Transolver, Transolver++ is further equipped with an extremely optimized parallelism framework and a local adaptive mechanism to efficiently capture eidetic physical states from massive mesh points, successfully tackling the thorny challenges in computation and physics learning when scaling up input mesh size. Transolver++ increases the single-GPU input capacity to million-scale points for the first time and is capable of continuously scaling input size in linear complexity by increasing GPUs. Experimentally, Transolver++ yields 13% relative promotion across six standard PDE benchmarks and achieves over 20% performance gain in million-scale high-fidelity industrial simulations, whose sizes are 100$\times$ larger than previous benchmarks, covering car and 3D aircraft designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a "clusterability loss" function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability techniques, we show that our method can help train models that are more modular and learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and language models. Our approach provides a promising direction for training neural networks that learn simpler functions and are easier to interpret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Kolb, Tobias Weber, Bernd Bischl, David R\"ugamer</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse regularization techniques are well-established in machine learning, yet their application in neural networks remains challenging due to the non-differentiability of penalties like the $L_1$ norm, which is incompatible with stochastic gradient descent. A promising alternative is shallow weight factorization, where weights are decomposed into two factors, allowing for smooth optimization of $L_1$-penalized neural networks by adding differentiable $L_2$ regularization to the factors. In this work, we introduce deep weight factorization, extending previous shallow approaches to more than two factors. We theoretically establish equivalence of our deep factorization with non-convex sparse regularization and analyze its impact on training dynamics and optimization. Due to the limitations posed by standard training practices, we propose a tailored initialization scheme and identify important learning rate requirements necessary for training factorized networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep weight factorization through experiments on various architectures and datasets, consistently outperforming its shallow counterpart and widely used pruning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing Transformer architectures with the optimal layer normalization (LN) strategy that ensures large-scale training stability and expedite convergence has remained elusive, even in this era of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we present a comprehensive analytical foundation for understanding how different LN strategies influence training dynamics in large-scale Transformer training. Until recently, Pre-LN and Post-LN have long dominated standard practices despite their limitations in large-scale training. However, several open-source large-scale models have recently begun silently adopting a third strategy without much explanation. This strategy places layer normalization (LN) peripherally around sublayers, a design we term Peri-LN. While Peri-LN has demonstrated promising empirical performance, its precise mechanisms and benefits remain almost unexplored. Our in-depth analysis shows that Peri-LN strikes an ideal balance in variance growth -- unlike Pre-LN and Post-LN, which are prone to vanishing gradients and ``massive activations.'' To validate our theoretical insight, we conduct large-scale experiments on Transformers up to 3.2B parameters, showing that Peri-LN consistently achieves more balanced variance growth, steadier gradient flow, and convergence stability. Our results suggest that Peri-LN warrants broader consideration for large-scale Transformer architectures, providing renewed insights into the optimal placement and application of LN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayang Meng, Tao Huang, Hong Chen, Xin Shi, Qingyu Huang, Chen Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of deep learning models in privacy-sensitive domains has amplified concerns regarding privacy risks, particularly those stemming from gradient leakage during training. Current privacy assessments primarily rely on post-training attack simulations. However, these methods are inherently reactive, unable to encompass all potential attack scenarios, and often based on idealized adversarial assumptions. These limitations underscore the need for proactive approaches to privacy risk assessment during the training process. To address this gap, we propose the concept of privacy tokens, which are derived directly from private gradients during training. Privacy tokens encapsulate gradient features and, when combined with data features, offer valuable insights into the extent of private information leakage from training data, enabling real-time measurement of privacy risks without relying on adversarial attack simulations. Additionally, we employ Mutual Information (MI) as a robust metric to quantify the relationship between training data and gradients, providing precise and continuous assessments of privacy leakage throughout the training process. Extensive experiments validate our framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of privacy tokens and MI in identifying and quantifying privacy risks. This proactive approach marks a significant advancement in privacy monitoring, promoting the safer deployment of deep learning models in sensitive applications.</p>

Building on this, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that uses a pre-trained BERT model or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and significantly improves performance across diverse domains, including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anneke von Seeger, Dongmian Zou, Gilad Lerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) leverages information from a labeled source dataset to improve accuracy on a related but unlabeled target dataset. A common approach to UDA is aligning representations from the source and target domains by minimizing the distance between their data distributions. Previous methods have employed distances such as Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy. However, these approaches are less effective when the target data is significantly scarcer than the source data. Stein discrepancy is an asymmetric distance between distributions that relies on one distribution only through its score function. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method that uses Stein discrepancy to measure the distance between source and target domains. We develop a learning framework using both non-kernelized and kernelized Stein discrepancy. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound for the generalization error. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods using other domain discrepancy measures when only small amounts of target data are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael M{\o}ller H{\o}gsgaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the binary classification setting by Hanneke [2016b] and Larsen [2023] have resulted in optimal PAC learners. These learners leverage, respectively, a clever deterministic subsampling scheme and the classic heuristic of bagging Breiman [1996]. Both optimal PAC learners use, as a subroutine, the natural algorithm of empirical risk minimization. Consequently, the computational cost of these optimal PAC learners is tied to that of the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. In this work, we seek to provide an alternative perspective on the computational cost imposed by the link to the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. To this end, we show the existence of an optimal PAC learner, which offers a different tradeoff in terms of the computational cost induced by the empirical risk minimizer.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first asymptotically optimal strategy for a multi armed bandit (MAB) model under side constraints. The side constraints model situations in which bandit activations are limited by the availability of certain resources that are replenished at a constant rate. The main result involves the derivation of an asymptotic lower bound for the regret of feasible uniformly fast policies and the construction of policies that achieve this lower bound, under pertinent conditions. Further, we provide the explicit form of such policies for the case in which the unknown distributions are Normal with unknown means and known variances, for the case of Normal distributions with unknown means and unknown variances and for the case of arbitrary discrete distributions with finite support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Qiu, Zhou Yu, Ruoqing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Statistical analysis is increasingly confronted with complex data from metric spaces. Petersen and M\"uller (2019) established a general paradigm of Fr\'echet regression with complex metric space valued responses and Euclidean predictors. However, the local approach therein involves nonparametric kernel smoothing and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we in this paper propose a novel random forest weighted local Fr\'echet regression paradigm. The main mechanism of our approach relies on a locally adaptive kernel generated by random forests. Our first method uses these weights as the local average to solve the conditional Fr\'echet mean, while the second method performs local linear Fr\'echet regression, both significantly improving existing Fr\'echet regression methods. Based on the theory of infinite order U-processes and infinite order $M_{m_n}$-estimator, we establish the consistency, rate of convergence, and asymptotic normality for our local constant estimator, which covers the current large sample theory of random forests with Euclidean responses as a special case. Numerical studies show the superiority of our methods with several commonly encountered types of responses such as distribution functions, symmetric positive-definite matrices, and sphere data. The practical merits of our proposals are also demonstrated through the application to New York taxi data and human mortality data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darui Lu, Yang Deng, Jordan M. Malof, Willie J. Padilla</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, LlaMa, and Claude are trained on massive quantities of text parsed from the internet and have shown a remarkable ability to respond to complex prompts in a manner often indistinguishable from humans. For all-dielectric metamaterials consisting of unit cells with four elliptical resonators, we present a LLM fine-tuned on up to 40,000 data that can predict the absorptivity spectrum given a text prompt that only specifies the metasurface geometry. Results are compared to conventional machine learning approaches including feed-forward neural networks, random forest, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Remarkably, the fine-tuned LLM (FT-LLM) achieves a comparable performance across large dataset sizes with a deep neural network. We also explore inverse problems by asking the LLM to predict the geometry necessary to achieve a desired spectrum. LLMs possess several advantages over humans that may give them benefits for research, including the ability to process enormous amounts of data, find hidden patterns in data, and operate in higher-dimensional spaces. This suggests they may be able to leverage their general knowledge of the world to learn faster from training data than traditional models, making them valuable tools for research and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzi Yan, Yibo Miao, Jialian Li, Yipin Zhang, Jian Xie, Zhijie Deng, Dong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has gained significant attention, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a standard yet computationally expensive method and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a more efficient alternative. While DPO offers simplicity, it remains underutilized in state-of-the-art LLMs, suggesting potential limitations. In this work, we revisit DPO, analyzing its theoretical foundations and empirical performance to bridge this gap. We identify three key properties, termed 3D properties, that emerge from DPO's learning process: Drastic drop in rejected response likelihood, Degradation into response suppression, and Dispersion effect on unseen responses. We show that these issues arise from DPO's optimization dynamics, where the interaction between chosen and rejected response gradients leads to instability. Our findings are supported by experiments on both a controlled toy model and real-world LLM tasks, including mathematical problem-solving and instruction following. To address these challenges, we propose simple regularization techniques that improve training stability and performance. Additionally, we examine how preference data distribution impacts DPO's effectiveness, offering insights into how alignment models handle out-of-domain (OOD) data. Our work connects these observations to broader research and provides a theoretical explanation for DPO's limitations. We hope these insights will guide future advancements in reward-model-free preference learning, bringing it closer to reward-model-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teun van der Weij, Felix Hofst\"atter, Ollie Jaffe, Samuel F. Brown, Francis Rhys Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging, which we define as strategic underperformance on an evaluation. In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted or password-locked to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. We have mediocre success in password-locking a model to mimic the answers a weaker model would give. Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rigorous software testing is crucial for developing and maintaining high-quality code, making automated test generation a promising avenue for both improving software quality and boosting the effectiveness of code generation methods. However, while code generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) is an extraordinarily active research area, test generation remains relatively unexplored. We address this gap and investigate the capability of LLM-based Code Agents to formalize user issues into test cases. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark based on popular GitHub repositories, containing real-world issues, ground-truth bug-fixes, and golden tests. We find that LLMs generally perform surprisingly well at generating relevant test cases, with Code Agents designed for code repair exceeding the performance of systems designed specifically for test generation. Further, as test generation is a similar but more structured task than code generation, it allows for a more fine-grained analysis using issue reproduction rate and coverage changes, providing a dual metric for analyzing systems designed for code repair. Finally, we find that generated tests are an effective filter for proposed code fixes, doubling the precision of SWE-Agent.

<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Guided by task-specific modality impact, we recommend modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also find that models may follow inductive biases from multimodal ICL even if they are rarely seen in or contradict semantic priors from pretraining data. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kapoor, Benjamin Freed, Howie Choset, Jeff Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Hao, Bahareh Nakisa, Mohmmad Naim Rastgoo, Richard Dazeley, Gaoyang Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i)~A novel dual intrinsic rewarding scheme to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii)~A new context-aware weighting mechanism for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning in HAIC. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the convergence time by about 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances (Sherman, 2017; Sidford and Tian, 2018; Cohen et al., 2021) have overcome the fundamental barrier of dimension dependence in the iteration complexity of solving $\ell_\infty$ regression with first-order methods. Yet it remains unclear to what extent such acceleration can be achieved for general $\ell_p$ smooth functions. In this paper, we propose a new accelerated first-order method for convex optimization under non-Euclidean smoothness assumptions. In contrast to standard acceleration techniques, our approach uses primal-dual iterate sequences taken with respect to $\textit{differing}$ norms, which are then coupled using an $\textit{implicitly}$ determined interpolation parameter. For $\ell_p$ norm smooth problems in $d$ dimensions, our method provides an iteration complexity improvement of up to $O(d^{1-\frac{2}{p}})$ in terms of calls to a first-order oracle, thereby allowing us to circumvent long-standing barriers in accelerated non-Euclidean steepest descent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Hwa Lee, Thomas Jiralerspong, Lei Yu, Yoshua Bengio, Emily Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Licong Lin, Jinghan Jia, Ruiqi Zhang, Song Mei, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

<p>Abstract: The selective classifier (SC) has been proposed for rank based uncertainty thresholding, which could have applications in safety critical areas such as medical diagnostics, autonomous driving, and the justice system. The Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) has emerged as the foremost evaluation metric for assessing the performance of SC systems. In this work, we present a formal statistical formulation of population AURC, presenting an equivalent expression that can be interpreted as a reweighted risk function. Through Monte Carlo methods, we derive empirical AURC plug-in estimators for finite sample scenarios. The weight estimators associated with these plug-in estimators are shown to be consistent, with low bias and tightly bounded mean squared error (MSE). The plug-in estimators are proven to converge at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\ln(n)/n})$ demonstrating statistical consistency. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our estimators through experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and confidence score functions (CSFs), demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in fine-tuning AURC performance.</p>

However, recent studies suggest that the topics generated by these models often do not align well with human intentions. Although metadata such as labels and authorship information are available, it has not yet been effectively incorporated into neural topic models. To address this gap, we introduce FANToM, a novel method to align neural topic models with both labels and authorship information. FANToM allows for the inclusion of this metadata when available, producing interpretable topics and author distributions for each topic. Our approach demonstrates greater expressiveness than conventional topic models by learning the alignment between labels, topics, and authors. Experimental results show that FANToM improves existing models in terms of both topic quality and alignment. Additionally, it identifies author interests and similarities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study active data collection strategies for operator learning when the target operator is linear and the input functions are drawn from a mean-zero stochastic process with continuous covariance kernels. With an active data collection strategy, we establish an error convergence rate in terms of the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance kernel. We can achieve arbitrarily fast error convergence rates with sufficiently rapid eigenvalue decay of the covariance kernels. This contrasts with the passive (i.i.d.) data collection strategies, where the convergence rate is never faster than linear decay ($\sim n^{-1}$). In fact, for our setting, we show a \emph{non-vanishing} lower bound for any passive data collection strategy, regardless of the eigenvalues decay rate of the covariance kernel. Overall, our results show the benefit of active data collection strategies in operator learning over their passive counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Ochoa Rivera, Ambuj Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: Bandit algorithms have garnered significant attention due to their practical applications in real-world scenarios. However, beyond simple settings such as multi-arm or linear bandits, optimal algorithms remain scarce. Notably, no optimal solution exists for pure exploration problems in the context of generalized linear model (GLM) bandits. In this paper, we narrow this gap and develop the first track-and-stop algorithm for general pure exploration problems under the logistic bandit called logistic track-and-stop (Log-TS). Log-TS is an efficient algorithm that asymptotically matches an approximation for the instance-specific lower bound of the expected sample complexity up to a logarithmic factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apostolos Kokolis, Michael Kuchnik, John Hoffman, Adithya Kumar, Parth Malani, Faye Ma, Zachary DeVito, Shubho Sengupta, Kalyan Saladi, Carole-Jean Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliability is a fundamental challenge in operating large-scale machine learning (ML) infrastructures, particularly as the scale of ML models and training clusters continues to grow. Despite decades of research on infrastructure failures, the impact of job failures across different scales remains unclear. This paper presents a view of managing two large, multi-tenant ML clusters, providing quantitative analysis, operational experience, and our own perspective in understanding and addressing reliability concerns at scale. Our analysis reveals that while large jobs are most vulnerable to failures, smaller jobs make up the majority of jobs in the clusters and should be incorporated into optimization objectives. We identify key workload properties, compare them across clusters, and demonstrate essential reliability requirements for pushing the boundaries of ML training at scale.
  We hereby introduce a taxonomy of failures and key reliability metrics, analyze 11 months of data from two state-of-the-art ML environments with 4 million jobs and over 150 million A100 GPU hours. Building on our data, we fit a failure model to project Mean Time to Failure for various GPU scales. We further propose a method to estimate a related metric, Effective Training Time Ratio, as a function of job parameters, and we use this model to gauge the efficacy of potential software mitigations at scale. Our work provides valuable insights and future research directions for improving the reliability of AI supercomputer clusters, emphasizing the need for flexible, workload-agnostic, and reliability-aware infrastructure, system software, and algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjay Das, Swastik Bhattacharya, Souvik Kundu, Shamik Kundu, Anand Menon, Arnab Raha, Kanad Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangqi Li, Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating realistic images from arbitrary text prompts. However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram Zaveri, Shivang Patel, Yu Gu, Gianfranco Doretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU. Our code and models are available at https://wvuvl.github.io/SiamABC/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose two simple yet principled algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs), which require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation. (i) The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them for a final output, via a knockout tournament where pairwise comparisons among the candidates are conducted. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. (ii) The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate solution is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under certain technical assumptions that are analogous to but more robust than those required by the knockout-style algorithm, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the league-style algorithm also decays to zero exponentially as its test-time compute grows. Through extensive experiments with two challenging benchmarks, namely GPQA and MMLU-Pro, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gary A. McCully, John D. Hastings, Shengjie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the impact of data snooping on neural networks used to detect vulnerabilities in lifted code, and builds on previous research that used word2vec and unidirectional and bidirectional transformer-based embeddings. The research specifically focuses on how model performance is affected when embedding models are trained with datasets, which include samples used for neural network training and validation. The results show that introducing data snooping did not significantly alter model performance, suggesting that data snooping had a minimal impact or that samples randomly dropped as part of the methodology contained hidden features critical to achieving optimal performance. In addition, the findings reinforce the conclusions of previous research, which found that models trained with GPT-2 embeddings consistently outperformed neural networks trained with other embeddings. The fact that this holds even when data snooping is introduced into the embedding model indicates GPT-2's robustness in representing complex code features, even under less-than-ideal conditions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136">Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. To model graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool. However, existing GNN architectures encounter challenges in cross-graph learning where multiple graphs have different feature spaces. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with a textual description, which can be projected into a unified feature space using textual encoders. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed graph data, which is difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), leveraging large language models (LLMs) to convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information into LLMs to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating its applicability. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data in the absence of textual information.

<p>Abstract: We address unsupervised dependency parsing by building an ensemble of diverse existing models through post hoc aggregation of their output dependency parse structures. We observe that these ensembles often suffer from low robustness against weak ensemble components due to error accumulation. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient ensemble-selection approach that considers error diversity and avoids error accumulation. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms each individual model as well as previous ensemble techniques. Additionally, our experiments show that the proposed ensemble-selection method significantly enhances the performance and robustness of our ensemble, surpassing previously proposed strategies, which have not accounted for error diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study zero-sum games in the space of probability distributions over the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with entropy regularization, in the setting when the interaction function between the players is smooth and strongly convex-strongly concave. We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game. We also study the finite-particle approximation of the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We prove biased convergence guarantees for the continuous-time finite-particle min-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an explicit bias term which does not scale with the number of particles. We also prove biased convergence guarantees for the discrete-time finite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the step size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration complexity for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to approximately compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.</p>

<p>Abstract: While ML model training and inference are both GPU-intensive, CPU-based data processing is often the bottleneck. Distributed data processing systems based on the batch or stream processing models assume homogeneous resource requirements. They excel at CPU-based computation but either under-utilize heterogeneous resources or impose high overheads on failure and reconfiguration. We introduce the streaming batch model, a hybrid of the two models that enables efficient and fault-tolerant heterogeneous execution. The key idea is to execute one partition at a time to allow lineage-based recovery with dynamic resource allocation. This enables memory-efficient pipelining across heterogeneous resources, similar to stream processing, but also offers the elasticity and fault tolerance properties of batch processing. We present Ray Data, an implementation of the streaming batch model that improves throughput on heterogeneous batch inference pipelines by 3--8$\times$ compared to traditional batch and stream processing systems. When training Stable Diffusion, Ray Data matches the throughput of single-node ML data loaders while additionally leveraging distributed heterogeneous clusters to further improve training throughput by 31%.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633">Representation of Molecules via Algebraic Data Types : Advancing Beyond SMILES &amp; SELFIES</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Goldstein, Samuel March</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler types that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a representation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure meaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with sample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based representations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to chemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical output. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular constitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate data to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a general digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the string-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are based. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through representation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the representational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular Orbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key applications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through integration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules are made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning techniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different representations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an extension to model chemical reactions. After critiquing previous representations, we provide an open-source solution in Haskell - a type-safe, purely functional programming language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer</p>
<p>Abstract: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Herrera-Esposito, Johannes Burge</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Despite the availability of methods for learning complex non-linear features (e.g. Deep Learning), there is an enduring demand for dimensionality reduction methods that learn linear features due to their interpretability, low computational cost, and broad applicability. However, there is a gap between methods that optimize linear separability (e.g. LDA), and more flexible but computationally expensive methods that optimize over arbitrary class boundaries (e.g. metric-learning methods). Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a dimensionality reduction method for learning linear features that maximize the differences between class-conditional first- and second-order statistics, which allow for quadratic discrimination. SQFA exploits the information geometry of second-order statistics in the symmetric positive definite manifold. We show that SQFA features support quadratic discriminability in real-world problems. We also provide a theoretical link, based on information geometry, between SQFA and the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier.</p>

Specifically, we combine concepts from abduction, logic programming, and rule learning to create an efficient method that approaches full recall of dark vessels while requiring less search area than machine learning methods. We provide a logic-based paradigm for reasoning about maritime vessels, an abductive inference query method, an automatically extracted rule-based behavior model methodology, and a thorough suite of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Tao Chang, Shivaram Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p>

While this theoretical framework often assumes uniform reliability across all predictions, modern machine learning models can now provide instance-level uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this gap, demonstrating the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online job scheduling problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves optimal prediction-dependent performance and prove that, in high-variance settings, calibrated advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification. For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of calibration for algorithms with predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Pan, Yupei Zhang, Qiushi Yang, Tan Li, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently computer-aided diagnosis has demonstrated promising performance, effectively alleviating the workload of clinicians. However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Shou, Guyue Liu, Hao Nie, Huaiyu Meng, Yu Zhou, Yimin Jiang, Wenqing Lv, Yelong Xu, Yuanwei Lu, Zhang Chen, Yanbo Yu, Yichen Shen, Yibo Zhu, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfinitePOD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfinitePOD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfinitePOD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Qirun Dai, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training.
  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</p>
