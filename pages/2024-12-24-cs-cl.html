<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohom Ghosh, Arnab Maji, N Harsha Vardhan, Sudip Kumar Naskar</p>
<p>Abstract: With consistent growth in Indian Economy, Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) have become a popular avenue for investment. With the modern technology simplifying investments, more investors are interested in making data driven decisions while subscribing for IPOs. In this paper, we describe a machine learning and natural language processing based approach for estimating if an IPO will be successful. We have extensively studied the impact of various facts mentioned in IPO filing prospectus, macroeconomic factors, market conditions, Grey Market Price, etc. on the success of an IPO. We created two new datasets relating to the IPOs of Indian companies. Finally, we investigated how information from multiple modalities (texts, images, numbers, and categorical features) can be used for estimating the direction and underpricing with respect to opening, high and closing prices of stocks on the IPO listing day.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik Sivakoti</p>
<p>Abstract: While Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have achieved high performances on benchmark datasets, there are still concerns whether they truly capture the intended task, or largely exploit dataset artifacts. Through detailed analysis of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, we have uncovered complex patterns of various types of artifacts and their interactions, leading to the development of our novel structural debiasing approach. Our fine-grained analysis of 9,782 validation examples reveals four major categories of artifacts: length-based patterns, lexical overlap, subset relationships, and negation patterns. Our multi-head debiasing architecture achieves substantial improvements across all bias categories: length bias accuracy improved from 86.03% to 90.06%, overlap bias from 91.88% to 93.13%, subset bias from 95.43% to 96.49%, and negation bias from 88.69% to 94.64%. Overall, our approach reduces the error rate from 14.19% to 10.42% while maintaining high performance on unbiased examples. Analysis of 1,026 error cases shows significant improvement in handling neutral relationships, traditionally one of the most challenging areas for NLI systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16302">Decoding Linguistic Nuances in Mental Health Text Classification Using Expressive Narrative Stories</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwen Tang, Qiming Guo, Yunxin Zhao, Yi Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in NLP have spurred significant interest in analyzing social media text data for identifying linguistic features indicative of mental health issues. However, the domain of Expressive Narrative Stories (ENS)-deeply personal and emotionally charged narratives that offer rich psychological insights-remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap by utilizing a dataset sourced from Reddit, focusing on ENS from individuals with and without self-declared depression. Our research evaluates the utility of advanced language models, BERT and MentalBERT, against traditional models. We find that traditional models are sensitive to the absence of explicit topic-related words, which could risk their potential to extend applications to ENS that lack clear mental health terminology. Despite MentalBERT is design to better handle psychiatric contexts, it demonstrated a dependency on specific topic words for classification accuracy, raising concerns about its application when explicit mental health terms are sparse (P-value<0.05). In contrast, BERT exhibited minimal sensitivity to the absence of topic words in ENS, suggesting its superior capability to understand deeper linguistic features, making it more effective for real-world applications. Both BERT and MentalBERT excel at recognizing linguistic nuances and maintaining classification accuracy even when narrative order is disrupted. This resilience is statistically significant, with sentence shuffling showing substantial impacts on model performance (P-value<0.05), especially evident in ENS comparisons between individuals with and without mental health declarations. These findings underscore the importance of exploring ENS for deeper insights into mental health-related narratives, advocating for a nuanced approach to mental health text analysis that moves beyond mere keyword detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large-scale language models increasingly impact safety-critical domains, ensuring their reliable adherence to well-defined principles remains a fundamental challenge. We introduce Deliberative Alignment, a new paradigm that directly teaches the model safety specifications and trains it to explicitly recall and accurately reason over the specifications before answering. We used this approach to align OpenAI's o-series models, and achieved highly precise adherence to OpenAI's safety policies, without requiring human-written chain-of-thoughts or answers. Deliberative Alignment pushes the Pareto frontier by simultaneously increasing robustness to jailbreaks while decreasing overrefusal rates, and also improves out-of-distribution generalization. We demonstrate that reasoning over explicitly specified policies enables more scalable, trustworthy, and interpretable alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilanjana Das, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research on LLM vulnerabilities often relied on nonsensical adversarial prompts, which were easily detectable by automated methods. We address this gap by focusing on human-readable adversarial prompts, a more realistic and potent threat. Our key contributions are situation-driven attacks leveraging movie scripts to create contextually relevant, human-readable prompts that successfully deceive LLMs, adversarial suffix conversion to transform nonsensical adversarial suffixes into meaningful text, and AdvPrompter with p-nucleus sampling, a method to generate diverse, human-readable adversarial suffixes, improving attack efficacy in models like GPT-3.5 and Gemma 7B. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can be tricked by sophisticated adversaries into producing harmful responses with human-readable adversarial prompts and that there exists a scope for improvement when it comes to robust LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Robiul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: In this era of technological advancements, several cutting-edge techniques are being implemented to enhance Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on improving safety, efficiency, and adaptability in complex driving environments. However, AD still faces some problems including performance limitations. To address this problem, we conducted an in-depth study on implementing the Multi-modal Large Language Model. We constructed a Virtual Question Answering (VQA) dataset to fine-tune the model and address problems with the poor performance of MLLM on AD. We then break down the AD decision-making process by scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. Chain of Thought has been used to make the decision more perfectly. Our experiments and detailed analysis of Autonomous Driving give an idea of how important MLLM is for AD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shogo Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: This report presents a small language model (SLM) for Japanese clinical and medicine, named NCVC-slm-1. This 1B parameters model was trained using Japanese text classified to be of high-quality. Moreover, NCVC-slm-1 was augmented with respect to clinical and medicine content that includes the variety of diseases, drugs, and examinations. Using a carefully designed pre-processing, a specialized morphological analyzer and tokenizer, this small and light-weight model performed not only to generate text but also indicated the feasibility of understanding clinical and medicine text. In comparison to other large language models, a fine-tuning NCVC-slm-1 demonstrated the highest scores on 6 tasks of total 8 on JMED-LLM. According to this result, SLM indicated the feasibility of performing several downstream tasks in the field of clinical and medicine. Hopefully, NCVC-slm-1 will be contributed to develop and accelerate the field of clinical and medicine for a bright future.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16444">Effective Context Modeling Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong Tran Van, Thanh V. T. Tran, Van Nguyen, Truong Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) facilitates a deeper understanding of the emotions conveyed by speakers in each utterance within a conversation. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their strengths in capturing data relationships, particularly in contextual information modeling and multimodal fusion. However, existing methods often struggle to fully capture the complex interactions between multiple modalities and conversational context, limiting their expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose ConxGNN, a novel GNN-based framework designed to capture contextual information in conversations. ConxGNN features two key parallel modules: a multi-scale heterogeneous graph that captures the diverse effects of utterances on emotional changes, and a hypergraph that models the multivariate relationships among modalities and utterances. The outputs from these modules are integrated into a fusion layer, where a cross-modal attention mechanism is applied to produce a contextually enriched representation. Additionally, ConxGNN tackles the challenge of recognizing minority or semantically similar emotion classes by incorporating a re-weighting scheme into the loss functions. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16455">Research on Violent Text Detection System Based on BERT-fasttext Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongsheng Yang, Xiaoying Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital age of today, the internet has become an indispensable platform for people's lives, work, and information exchange. However, the problem of violent text proliferation in the network environment has arisen, which has brought about many negative effects. In view of this situation, it is particularly important to build an effective system for cutting off violent text. The study of violent text cutting off based on the BERT-fasttext model has significant meaning. BERT is a pre-trained language model with strong natural language understanding ability, which can deeply mine and analyze text semantic information; Fasttext itself is an efficient text classification tool with low complexity and good effect, which can quickly provide basic judgments for text processing. By combining the two and applying them to the system for cutting off violent text, on the one hand, it can accurately identify violent text, and on the other hand, it can efficiently and reasonably cut off the content, preventing harmful information from spreading freely on the network. Compared with the single BERT model and fasttext, the accuracy was improved by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Through this model, it is helpful to purify the network environment, maintain the health of network information, and create a positive, civilized, and harmonious online communication space for netizens, driving the development of social networking, information dissemination, and other aspects in a more benign direction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16464">Transducer-Llama: Integrating LLMs into Streamable Transducer-based Speech Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Keqi Deng, Jinxi Guo, Yingyi Ma, Niko Moritz, Philip C. Woodland, Ozlem Kalinli, Mike Seltzer</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR), the task of making the model streamable remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel model architecture, Transducer-Llama, that integrates LLMs into a Factorized Transducer (FT) model, naturally enabling streaming capabilities. Furthermore, given that the large vocabulary of LLMs can cause data sparsity issue and increased training costs for spoken language systems, this paper introduces an efficient vocabulary adaptation technique to align LLMs with speech system vocabularies. The results show that directly optimizing the FT model with a strong pre-trained LLM-based predictor using the RNN-T loss yields some but limited improvements over a smaller pre-trained LM predictor. Therefore, this paper proposes a weak-to-strong LM swap strategy, using a weak LM predictor during RNN-T loss training and then replacing it with a strong LLM. After LM replacement, the minimum word error rate (MWER) loss is employed to finetune the integration of the LLM predictor with the Transducer-Llama model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech and large-scale multi-lingual LibriSpeech corpora show that the proposed streaming Transducer-Llama approach gave a 17% relative WER reduction (WERR) over a strong FT baseline and a 32% WERR over an RNN-T baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Ung, Alicia Sun, Samuel J. Bell, Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Levent Sagun, Adina Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned for use on downstream tasks, though this can degrade capabilities learned during previous training. This phenomenon, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting, has important potential implications for the safety of deployed models. In this work, we first show that models trained on downstream tasks forget their safety tuning to a greater extent than models trained in the opposite order.Second, we show that forgetting disproportionately impacts safety information about certain groups. To quantify this phenomenon, we define a new metric we term biased forgetting. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the effects of task ordering on forgetting and apply mitigations that can help the model recover from the forgetting observed. We hope our findings can better inform methods for chaining the finetuning of LLMs in continual learning settings to enable training of safer and less toxic models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pervasive influence of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a double-edged sword, enhancing communication while simultaneously propagating misinformation. This \textit{Digital Infodemic} has highlighted the urgent need for automated tools capable of discerning and disseminating factual content. This study evaluates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) as innovative solutions for mitigating misinformation on platforms like Twitter. LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT and Meta's LLaMA, offer a pre-trained, adaptable approach that bypasses the extensive training and overfitting issues associated with traditional machine learning models. We assess the performance of LLMs in detecting and classifying COVID-19-related scientific claims, thus facilitating informed decision-making. Our findings indicate that LLMs have significant potential as automated fact-checking tools, though research in this domain is nascent and further exploration is required. We present a comparative analysis of LLMs' performance using a specialized dataset and propose a framework for their application in public health communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Zhao, Hao Shi, Chenrui Cui, Tianrui Wang, Hexin Liu, Zhaoheng Ni, Lingxuan Ye, Longbiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in human-LLM interactions remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and openness of dialogue processes. This paper introduces HammerBench, a novel benchmarking framework designed to assess the function-calling ability of LLMs more effectively in such interactions. We model a wide range of real-world user scenarios on mobile devices, encompassing imperfect instructions, diverse question-answer trajectories, intent/argument shifts, and the use of external individual information through pronouns. To construct the corresponding datasets, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that involves LLM-generated data and multiple rounds of human validation, ensuring high data quality. Additionally, we decompose the conversations into function-calling snapshots, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of each turn. We evaluate several popular LLMs using HammerBench and highlight different performance aspects. Our empirical findings reveal that errors in parameter naming constitute the primary factor behind conversation failures across different data types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisong Zhang, Yan Wang, Xinting Huang, Tianqing Fang, Hongming Zhang, Chenlong Deng, Shuaiyi Li, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, owing to their exceptional capabilities in context modeling. The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective mechanisms. Experiments on various tasks reveal that these methods effectively lower irregular attention entropy and narrow performance gaps. We hope this study can illuminate ways to enhance context modeling mechanisms.</p>

Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Fu, Xiaoyi Wang, Zaijiang Man, Caimei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As recursion has been underlying any linguistic work for the last 60 years, the acquisition of recursive structures by children during language learning has become a focal point of inquiry. This study delves into the developmental trajectory of Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of recursive possessives and locatives, assessing the impact of structural diversity on language acquisition. The research contrasts the comprehension of two-level recursive structures among children aged 3 to 7 years, employing answering question while seeing a picture task to elicit responses. The findings indicate that children do not attain adult-like proficiency in two-level recursion until the age of 6, and there exists a notable asymmetry in the acquisition of recursive possessives versus locatives. These results underscore the primacy of structural complexity and cognitive factors in the acquisition process, enhancing our comprehension of the cognitive foundations of language development and the pivotal role of recursion in child language acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxuan Zhang, Zhengxue Cheng, Yan Zhao, Shihao Wang, Dajiang Zhou, Guo Lu, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48\% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, \emph{L3TC} offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a $50\times$ reduction in model parameters. More importantly, \emph{L3TC} is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minda Hu, Qiyuan Zhang, Yufei Wang, Bowei He, Hongru Wang, Jingyan Zhou, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Chen Ma, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: As a crucial step to enhance LLMs alignment with human intentions, Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has a high demand on dataset quality. However, existing IFT datasets often contain knowledge that is inconsistent with LLMs' internal knowledge learned from the pre-training phase, which can greatly affect the efficacy of IFT. To address this issue, we introduce NILE (iNternal consIstency aLignmEnt) framework, aimed at optimizing IFT datasets to unlock LLMs' capability further. NILE operates by eliciting target pre-trained LLM's internal knowledge corresponding to instruction data. The internal knowledge is leveraged to revise the answer in IFT datasets. Additionally, we propose a novel Internal Consistency Filtering (ICF) method to filter training samples, ensuring its high consistency with LLM's internal knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that NILE-aligned IFT datasets sharply boost LLM performance across multiple LLM ability evaluation datasets, achieving up to 66.6% gain on Arena-Hard and 68.5% on Alpaca-Eval V2. Further analysis confirms that each component of the NILE}framework contributes to these substantial performance improvements, and provides compelling evidence that dataset consistency with pre-trained internal knowledge is pivotal for maximizing LLM potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aritra Kumar Lahiri, Qinmin Vivian Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to develop an open-domain and long-form Over-The-Top (OTT) Question-Answering (QA) dataset, DragonVerseQA, specifically oriented to the fantasy universe of "House of the Dragon" and "Game Of Thrones" TV series. Most existing QA datasets focus on short, fact-based answers sourced almost solely from Wikipedia articles, devoid of depth and contextual richness for sophisticated narrative understanding. We curate a dataset that combines full episode summaries sourced from HBO and fandom wiki websites, user reviews from sources like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, and high-quality, open-domain, legally admissible sources, and structured data from repositories like WikiData into one dataset. The dataset provides a multi-dimensional context, reflecting complex character dynamics and plot developments from these varied sources. That means, on equal footing, only after heavy data preprocessing and filtering methods will meaningful, non-spam unbiased reviews be available in this enriched dataset. The comprehensive insights are given through the long-form answers generated from this enriched context. This is what makes this valuable dataset for improving conversational AI, narrative analysis, sentiment analysis, summarization techniques, and relation extraction.
  A comparative analysis with state-of-the-art QA datasets such as SQuAD 2.0, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions brings to light the unique advantages of our dataset in terms of contextual complexity and answer length. Detailed reviews add layers to audience sentiment and narrative interpretation, raising the bar for domain-specific QA with a new quality benchmark. Our work also allows a deeper understanding of entertainment-industry content and opens the door to more knowledgeable and creative AI-driven interactions within digital media environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Fr\"ohling, Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini</p>
<p>Abstract: With the release of ever more capable large language models (LLMs), researchers in NLP and related disciplines have started to explore the usability of LLMs for a wide variety of different annotation tasks. Very recently, a lot of this attention has shifted to tasks that are subjective in nature. Given that the latest generations of LLMs have digested and encoded extensive knowledge about different human subpopulations and individuals, the hope is that these models can be trained, tuned or prompted to align with a wide range of different human perspectives. While researchers already evaluate the success of this alignment via surveys and tests, there is a lack of resources to evaluate the alignment on what oftentimes matters the most in NLP; the actual downstream tasks. To fill this gap we present SubData, a Python library that offers researchers working on topics related to subjectivity in annotation tasks a convenient way of collecting, combining and using a range of suitable datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin Ian Lo, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, Shane Mansfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and there is growing evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Li, Tianlong Xu, Kaiqi Yang, Yucheng Chu, Yanling Chen, Yichi Song, Qingsong Wen, Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for automatic error detection in education, particularly for math word problems (MWPs). While prior studies demonstrate the promise of LLMs as error detectors, they overlook the presence of multiple valid solutions for a single MWP. Our preliminary analysis reveals a significant performance gap between conventional and alternative solutions in MWPs, a phenomenon we term conformity bias in this work. To mitigate this bias, we introduce the Ask-Before-Detect (AskBD) framework, which generates adaptive reference solutions using LLMs to enhance error detection. Experiments on 200 examples of GSM8K show that AskBD effectively mitigates bias and improves performance, especially when combined with reasoning-enhancing techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirong Chen, Elizabeth Chason, Noah Mladenovski, Erin Wilson, Kristin Mullen, Stephen Martini, Meiyi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Yanzhao Zhang, Wen Xie, Mingxin Li, Ziqi Dai, Dingkun Long, Pengjun Xie, Meishan Zhang, Wenjie Li, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) aims to enable search across various modalities using a unified model, where queries and candidates can consist of pure text, images, or a combination of both. Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods. Last, we provide in-depth analyses of model scaling, training strategies, and perform ablation studies on both the model and synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can refine their responses based on feedback, enabling self-improvement through iterative training or test-time refinement. However, existing methods predominantly focus on refinement within the same reasoning format, which may lead to non-correcting behaviors. We propose CaP, a novel approach that uses external tools to refine chain-of-thought (CoT) responses generated by the same or other LLMs. CaP employs a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization with DPO variants. Our observations highlight the critical role of preference optimization in enabling effective refinement. Additionally, we compare several sampling strategies to leverage CoT and tools at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate CaP's potential for effective cross-reasoning refinement and efficient inference.</p>

Despite the Transformer architecture's typical preference for large parallel corpora, our results show that PBSMT achieves a BLEU score of 66.32, significantly exceeding the Transformer-NMT score of 53.7 on the same dataset. Additionally, we explore variations of the SMT architecture, including training on Romanized text and modifying the word order of Persian sentences to match the left-to-right (LTR) structure of Hindi. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing the right architecture based on language pair characteristics and advocate for SMT as a high-performing alternative, even in contexts commonly dominated by NMT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charitha Rathnayake, P. R. S. Thilakarathna, Uthpala Nethmini, Rishemjith Kaur, Surangika Ranathunga</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilingual lexicons play a crucial role in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, many low-resource languages (LRLs) do not have such lexicons, and due to the same reason, cannot benefit from the supervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) techniques. To address this, unsupervised BLI (UBLI) techniques were introduced. A prominent technique in this line is structure-based UBLI. It is an iterative method, where a seed lexicon, which is initially learned from monolingual embeddings is iteratively improved. There have been numerous improvements to this core idea, however they have been experimented with independently of each other. In this paper, we investigate whether using these techniques simultaneously would lead to equal gains. We use the unsupervised version of VecMap, a commonly used structure-based UBLI framework, and carry out a comprehensive set of experiments using the LRL pairs, English-Sinhala, English-Tamil, and English-Punjabi. These experiments helped us to identify the best combination of the extensions. We also release bilingual dictionaries for English-Sinhala and English-Punjabi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinheon Baek (GS), Sun Jae Lee (GS), Prakhar Gupta (GS),  Geunseob (GS),  Oh, Siddharth Dalmia, Prateek Kolhar</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is a technique by which language models make predictions based on examples provided in their input context. Previously, their context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be shown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the maximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that can be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL performance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample selection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs through extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we observe that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, we find that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL from that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting sufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain datasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context window; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data augmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite the encouraging results of previous studies, prior methods prompt LLMs to predict answers directly, neglecting intermediate thought processes. We argue that prior methods do not sufficiently activate the capacities of LLMs. We propose a framework called PLRH that Prompts LLMs with Rationale Heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. The PLRH prompts LLMs with Chain of Thought (CoT) to generate rationale heuristics, i.e., intermediate thought processes, and then leverages the rationale heuristics to inspire LLMs to predict answers. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing baselines by more than 2.2 and 2.1 on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study aims to improve the efficiency and quality of career interviews conducted by nursing managers. To this end, we have been developing a slot-filling dialogue system that engages in pre-interviews to collect information on staff careers as a preparatory step before the actual interviews. Conventional slot-filling-based interview dialogue systems have limitations in the flexibility of information collection because the dialogue progresses based on predefined slot sets. We therefore propose a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate new slots according to the flow of the dialogue, achieving more natural conversations. Furthermore, we incorporate abduction into the slot generation process to enable more appropriate and effective slot generation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a user simulator. The results suggest that the proposed method using abduction is effective in enhancing both information-collecting capabilities and the naturalness of the dialogue.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://github.com/Aiden0526/Aristotle.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) aims to assign one or more labels in the hierarchy for each text. Many methods represent this structure as a global hierarchy, leading to redundant graph structures. To address this, incorporating a text-specific local hierarchy is essential. However, existing approaches often model this local hierarchy as a sequence, focusing on explicit parent-child relationships while ignoring implicit correlations among sibling/peer relationships. In this paper, we first integrate local hierarchies into a manual depth-level prompt to capture parent-child relationships. We then apply Mixup to this hierarchical prompt tuning scheme to improve the latent correlation within sibling/peer relationships. Notably, we propose a novel Mixup ratio guided by local hierarchy correlation to effectively capture intrinsic correlations. This Local Hierarchy Mixup (LH-Mix) model demonstrates remarkable performance across three widely-used datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Named Entity Recognition has traditionally been a key task in natural language processing, aiming to identify and extract important terms from unstructured text data. However, a notable challenge for contemporary deep-learning NER models has been identifying discontinuous entities, which are often fragmented within the text. To date, methods to address Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition have not been explored using ensemble learning to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT in recent years, has shown significant effectiveness across many NLP tasks. Most existing approaches, however, have primarily utilized ChatGPT as a problem-solving tool rather than exploring its potential as an integrative element within ensemble learning algorithms. In this study, we investigated the integration of ChatGPT as an arbitrator within an ensemble method, aiming to enhance performance on DNER tasks. Our method combines five state-of-the-art NER models with ChatGPT using custom prompt engineering to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the ensemble algorithm. We conducted experiments on three benchmark medical datasets, comparing our method against the five SOTA models, individual applications of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and a voting ensemble method. The results indicate that our proposed fusion of ChatGPT with the ensemble learning algorithm outperforms the SOTA results in the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance NLP applications in the healthcare domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their robustness against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the robustness of GPT LLM family. We employ two distinct evaluation methods to assess their resilience. The first method introduce character-level text attack in input prompts, testing the models on three sentiment classification datasets: StanfordNLP/IMDB, Yelp Reviews, and SST-2. The second method involves using jailbreak prompts to challenge the safety mechanisms of the LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant variations in the robustness of these models, demonstrating their varying degrees of vulnerability to both character-level and semantic-level adversarial attacks. These findings underscore the necessity for improved adversarial training and enhanced safety mechanisms to bolster the robustness of LLMs.</p>

While this mechanism has been extensively studied in explainability research, particularly through the attention values obtained during the forward pass of LMs, the backward pass of attention has been largely overlooked. In this work, we study the mathematics of the backward pass of attention, revealing that it implicitly calculates an attention matrix we refer to as "Reversed Attention". We examine the properties of Reversed Attention and demonstrate its ability to elucidate the models' behavior and edit dynamics. In an experimental setup, we showcase the ability of Reversed Attention to directly alter the forward pass of attention, without modifying the model's weights, using a novel method called "attention patching". In addition to enhancing the comprehension of how LM configure attention layers during backpropagation, Reversed Attention maps contribute to a more interpretable backward pass.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lovisa Hagstr\"om, Sara Vera Marjanovi\'c, Haeun Yu, Arnav Arora, Christina Lioma, Maria Maistro, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps address the limitations of the parametric knowledge embedded within a language model (LM). However, investigations of how LMs utilise retrieved information of varying complexity in real-world scenarios have been limited to synthetic contexts. We introduce DRUID (Dataset of Retrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-understand contexts) with real-world queries and contexts manually annotated for stance. The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complex and diverse real-world context settings. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source. Overall, our work underscores the need for real-world aligned context utilisation studies to represent and improve performance in real-world RAG settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie He, Nan Hu, Wanqiu Long, Jiaoyan Chen, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks but face significant challenges with complex, knowledge-intensive multi-hop queries, particularly those involving new or long-tail knowledge. Existing benchmarks often fail to fully address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MINTQA (Multi-hop Question Answering on New and Tail Knowledge), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-hop reasoning across four critical dimensions: question handling strategy, sub-question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative or dynamic decomposition and retrieval. MINTQA comprises 10,479 question-answer pairs for evaluating new knowledge and 17,887 pairs for assessing long-tail knowledge, with each question equipped with corresponding sub-questions and answers. Our systematic evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art LLMs on MINTQA reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle complex knowledge base queries, particularly in handling new or unpopular knowledge. Our findings highlight critical challenges and offer insights for advancing multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The MINTQA benchmark is available at https://github.com/probe2/multi-hop/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Gao, Xiangliang Zhang, Preslav Nakov, Xiuying Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major security concern as it can deceive LLMs to generate harmful text. Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Ridder, Malte Schilling</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is critical for enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness. Most research focuses on hallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However, the opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the understanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have picked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets, or the information might have been changed or contradicted during further training. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed some limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Ye, Mingbao Lin, Hwee Tou Ng, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 71.8\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esther Shizgal, Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a computational approach to analyze character development along the narrative timeline. The analysis characterizes the inner and outer changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative, and the interplay between them. We consider transcripts of Holocaust survivor testimonies as a test case, each telling the story of an individual in first-person terms. We focus on the survivor's religious trajectory, examining the evolution of their disposition toward religious belief and practice along the testimony. Clustering the resulting trajectories in the dataset, we identify common sequences in the data. Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religiosity across the narratives: in terms of belief, most present a constant disposition, while for practice, most present an oscillating structure, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research. This work demonstrates the potential of natural language processing techniques for analyzing character evolution through thematic trajectories in narratives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyu Zhang, Zhiyuan You, Jize Wang, Xinyi Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Information Extraction (DIE) aims to extract structured information from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs). Previous full-training approaches have demonstrated strong performance but may struggle with generalization to unseen data. In contrast, training-free methods leverage powerful pre-trained models like Large Language Models (LLMs) to address various downstream tasks with only a few examples. Nonetheless, training-free methods for DIE encounter two primary challenges: (1) understanding the complex relationship between layout and textual elements in VRDs, and (2) providing accurate guidance to pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose Sample-centric In-context Learning (SAIL) for DIE. SAIL introduces a fine-grained entity-level textual similarity to facilitate in-depth text analysis by LLMs and incorporates layout similarity to enhance the analysis of layouts in VRDs. Additionally, SAIL formulates a unified In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt template for various sample-centric examples, enabling tailored prompts that deliver precise guidance to pre-trained models for each sample. Extensive experiments on FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE benchmarks with various base models (e.g., LLMs) indicate that our method outperforms training-free baselines, even closer to the full-training methods. The results show the superiority and generalization of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhigen Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rizhao Fan, Ye Wang, Jianfeng Li, Shaojun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Paraphrase generation is a longstanding NLP task and achieves great success with the aid of large corpora. However, transferring a paraphrasing model to another domain encounters the problem of domain shifting especially when the data is sparse. At the same time, widely using large pre-trained language models (PLMs) faces the overfitting problem when training on scarce labeled data. To mitigate these two issues, we propose, LAPA, an effective adapter for PLMs optimized by meta-learning. LAPA has three-stage training on three types of related resources to solve this problem: 1. pre-training PLMs on unsupervised corpora, 2. inserting an adapter layer and meta-training on source domain labeled data, and 3. fine-tuning adapters on a small amount of target domain labeled data. This method enables paraphrase generation models to learn basic language knowledge first, then learn the paraphrasing task itself later, and finally adapt to the target task. Our experimental results demonstrate that LAPA achieves state-of-the-art in supervised, unsupervised, and low-resource settings on three benchmark datasets. With only 2\% of trainable parameters and 1\% labeled data of the target task, our approach can achieve a competitive performance with previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content that is as persuasive as human-written text and appear capable of selectively producing deceptive outputs. These capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse and unintended consequences as these systems become more widely deployed. This review synthesizes recent empirical work examining LLMs' capacity and proclivity for persuasion and deception, analyzes theoretical risks that could arise from these capabilities, and evaluates proposed mitigations. While current persuasive effects are relatively small, various mechanisms could increase their impact, including fine-tuning, multimodality, and social factors. We outline key open questions for future research, including how persuasive AI systems might become, whether truth enjoys an inherent advantage over falsehoods, and how effective different mitigation strategies may be in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of hate speech has become increasingly important in combating online hostility and its real-world consequences. Despite recent advancements, there is limited research addressing hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages, where resources and tools are scarce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in language-related tasks, traditional fine-tuning approaches are often infeasible given the size of the models. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Efficient Fine tuning (PEFT) based solution for hate speech detection and target identification. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the Devanagari dataset provided by (Thapa et al., 2025), which contains annotated instances in 2 languages - Hindi and Nepali. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in handling Devanagari-scripted content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agentic AI systems use specialized agents to handle tasks within complex workflows, enabling automation and efficiency. However, optimizing these systems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the transformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in output quality, relevance, and actionability.

<p>Abstract: Speech brain-computer interfaces aim to decipher what a person is trying to say from neural activity alone, restoring communication to people with paralysis who have lost the ability to speak intelligibly. The Brain-to-Text Benchmark '24 and associated competition was created to foster the advancement of decoding algorithms that convert neural activity to text. Here, we summarize the lessons learned from the competition ending on June 1, 2024 (the top 4 entrants also presented their experiences in a recorded webinar). The largest improvements in accuracy were achieved using an ensembling approach, where the output of multiple independent decoders was merged using a fine-tuned large language model (an approach used by all 3 top entrants). Performance gains were also found by improving how the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) model was trained, including by optimizing learning rate scheduling and by using a diphone training objective. Improving upon the model architecture itself proved more difficult, however, with attempts to use deep state space models or transformers not yet appearing to offer a benefit over the RNN baseline. The benchmark will remain open indefinitely to support further work towards increasing the accuracy of brain-to-text algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emojis have become ubiquitous in online communication, serving as a universal medium to convey emotions and decorative elements. Their widespread use transcends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and fostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable insight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a universal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not been thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis to serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and cultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the sentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well emoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset collected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of LLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant potential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent trend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number of emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve as global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as cross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.

However, existing general-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture the complexity and subtle nuances of real-world judicial cognition and decision-making. Therefore, we propose LegalAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM Agents in the Chinese legal domain. LegalAgentBench includes 17 corpora from real-world legal scenarios and provides 37 tools for interacting with external knowledge. We designed a scalable task construction framework and carefully annotated 300 tasks. These tasks span various types, including multi-hop reasoning and writing, and range across different difficulty levels, effectively reflecting the complexity of real-world legal scenarios. Moreover, beyond evaluating final success, LegalAgentBench incorporates keyword analysis during intermediate processes to calculate progress rates, enabling more fine-grained evaluation. We evaluated eight popular LLMs, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement of existing models and methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Feng, Tianlong Gu, Xiaoli Liu, Liang Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unnatural text correction aims to automatically detect and correct spelling errors or adversarial perturbation errors in sentences. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning or adversarial training to correct errors, which have achieved significant success. However, these methods exhibit poor generalization performance due to the difference in data distribution between training data and real-world scenarios, known as the exposure bias problem. In this paper, we propose a self-correct adversarial training framework for \textbf{L}earn\textbf{I}ng from \textbf{MI}s\textbf{T}akes (\textbf{LIMIT}), which is a task- and model-independent framework to correct unnatural errors or mistakes. Specifically, we fully utilize errors generated by the model that are actively exposed during the inference phase, i.e., predictions that are inconsistent with the target. This training method not only simulates potential errors in real application scenarios, but also mitigates the exposure bias of the traditional training process. Meanwhile, we design a novel decoding intervention strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Extensive experimental results on Chinese unnatural text error correction datasets show that our proposed method can correct multiple forms of errors and outperforms the state-of-the-art text correction methods. In addition, extensive results on Chinese and English datasets validate that LIMIT can serve as a plug-and-play defense module and can extend to new models and datasets without further training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueqian Wang, Xiaojun Meng, Yuxuan Wang, Jianxin Liang, Qun Liu, Dongyan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal multi-party conversation (MMC) is a less studied yet important topic of research due to that it well fits real-world scenarios and thus potentially has more widely-used applications. Compared with the traditional multi-modal conversations, MMC requires stronger character-centered understanding abilities as there are many interlocutors appearing in both the visual and textual context. To facilitate the study of this problem, we present Friends-MMC in this paper, an MMC dataset that contains 24,000+ unique utterances paired with video context. To explore the character-centered understanding of the dialogue, we also annotate the speaker of each utterance, the names and bounding bboxes of faces that appear in the video. Based on this Friends-MMC dataset, we further study two fundamental MMC tasks: conversation speaker identification and conversation response prediction, both of which have the multi-party nature with the video or image as visual context. For conversation speaker identification, we demonstrate the inefficiencies of existing methods such as pre-trained models, and propose a simple yet effective baseline method that leverages an optimization solver to utilize the context of two modalities to achieve better performance. For conversation response prediction, we fine-tune generative dialogue models on Friend-MMC, and analyze the benefits of speaker information. The code and dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/yellow-binary-tree/Friends-MMC and thus we call for more attention on modeling speaker information when understanding conversations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Devatine, Louis Abraham</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the extent of human edits on texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to understanding the human-AI interactions and improving the quality of automated text generation systems. Existing edit distance metrics, such as Levenshtein, BLEU, ROUGE, and TER, often fail to accurately measure the effort required for post-editing, especially when edits involve substantial modifications, such as block operations. In this paper, we introduce a novel compression-based edit distance metric grounded in the Lempel-Ziv-77 algorithm, designed to quantify the amount of post-editing applied to LLM-generated texts. Our method leverages the properties of text compression to measure the informational difference between the original and edited texts. Through experiments on real-world human edits datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metric is highly correlated with actual edit time and effort. We also show that LLMs exhibit an implicit understanding of editing speed, that aligns well with our metric. Furthermore, we compare our metric with existing ones, highlighting its advantages in capturing complex edits with linear computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Lin, Jingyao Liu, Yan Gao, Ante Wang, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphor detection, a critical task in natural language processing, involves identifying whether a particular word in a sentence is used metaphorically. Traditional approaches often rely on supervised learning models that implicitly encode semantic relationships based on metaphor theories. However, these methods often suffer from a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes, which undermines the reliability of their predictions. Recent research indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant potential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are constrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit and explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor detection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from the aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our framework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more reliable predictions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of DMD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across widely-used datasets.</p>

This paper introduces a three-class sentiment classification method for Weibo comments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to discern positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. LSTM, as a deep learning model, excels at capturing long-distance dependencies in text data, providing significant advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. Through preprocessing and feature extraction from Weibo comment texts, our LSTM model achieves precise sentiment prediction. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% and an F1 score of 98.28%, notably outperforming conventional models and other deep learning methods. This underscores the effectiveness of LSTM in capturing nuanced sentiment information within text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Despite its strengths, the LSTM model faces challenges such as high computational complexity and slower processing times for lengthy texts. Moreover, complex emotional expressions like sarcasm and humor pose additional difficulties. Future work could explore combining pre-trained models or advancing feature engineering techniques to further improve both accuracy and practicality. Overall, this study provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis on Weibo comments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre Rusli, Makoto Shishido</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the performance of three popular tokenization tools: MeCab, Sudachi, and SentencePiece, when applied as a preprocessing step for sentiment-based text classification of Japanese texts. Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization, we evaluate two traditional machine learning classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The results reveal that Sudachi produces tokens closely aligned with dictionary definitions, while MeCab and SentencePiece demonstrate faster processing speeds. The combination of SentencePiece, TF-IDF, and Logistic Regression outperforms the other alternatives in terms of classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Jia, Siyu Ren, Ziheng Qin, Fuzhao Xue, Jinjie Ni, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Datasets nowadays are generally constructed from multiple sources and using different synthetic techniques, making data de-noising and de-duplication crucial before being used for post-training. In this work, we propose to perform instruction tuning by iterative data selection (\ApproachName{}). We measure the quality of a sample from complexity and diversity simultaneously. Instead of calculating the complexity score once for all before fine-tuning, we highlight the importance of updating this model-specific score during fine-tuning to accurately accommodate the dynamic changes of the model. On the other hand, the diversity score is defined on top of the samples' responses under the consideration of their informativeness. IterIT integrates the strengths of both worlds by iteratively updating the complexity score for the top-ranked samples and greedily selecting the ones with the highest complexity-diversity score. Experiments on multiple instruction-tuning data demonstrate consistent improvements of IterIT over strong baselines. Moreover, our approach also generalizes well to domain-specific scenarios and different backbone models. All resources will be available at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/IterIT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Song, Zhikai Xue, Guoxiu He, Jiawei Liu, Wei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods optimize large language models (LLMs) by modifying or introducing a small number of parameters to enhance alignment with downstream tasks. However, they can result in catastrophic forgetting, where LLMs prioritize new knowledge at the expense of comprehensive world knowledge. A promising approach to mitigate this issue is to recall prior memories based on the original knowledge. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic PEFT framework, IMSM, which Interweaves Memories of a Siamese Large Language Model. Specifically, our siamese LLM is equipped with an existing PEFT method. Given an incoming query, it generates two distinct memories based on the pre-trained and fine-tuned parameters. IMSM then incorporates an interweaving mechanism that regulates the contributions of both original and enhanced memories when generating the next token. This framework is theoretically applicable to all open-source LLMs and existing PEFT methods. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets, evaluating the performance of popular open-source LLMs using the proposed IMSM, in comparison to both classical and leading PEFT methods. Our findings indicate that IMSM maintains comparable time and space efficiency to backbone PEFT methods while significantly improving performance and effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawen Feng, Pu Zhao, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Qianli Ma, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress achieved by code large language models (LLMs), their remarkable abilities are largely dependent on fine-tuning on the high-quality data, posing challenges for data collection and annotation. To address this, current methods often design various data flywheels to gather complex code instructions, enabling models to handle more intricate tasks. However, these approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf datasets and data augmentation from the limited pool of proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT4, and so on), which limits the diversity of the constructed data and makes it prone to systemic biases. In this paper, we propose WarriorCoder which learns from expert battles to address these limitations. Specifically, we create an arena for current expert code LLMs, where each model challenges and responds to others' challenges, with evaluations conducted by uninvolved judge models. This competitive framework generates novel training data constructed from scratch, harnessing the strengths of all participants. Experimental results demonstrate that WarriorCoder achieves competitive performance compared to previous methods, even without relying on proprietary LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Reza Qorib, Qisheng Hu, Hwee Tou Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Given news articles about an entity, such as a public figure or organization, timeline summarization (TLS) involves generating a timeline that summarizes the key events about the entity. However, the TLS task is too underspecified, since what is of interest to each reader may vary, and hence there is not a single ideal or optimal timeline. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, called Constrained Timeline Summarization (CTLS), where a timeline is generated in which all events in the timeline meet some constraint. An example of a constrained timeline concerns the legal battles of Tiger Woods, where only events related to his legal problems are selected to appear in the timeline. We collected a new human-verified dataset of constrained timelines involving 47 entities and 5 constraints per entity. We propose an approach that employs a large language model (LLM) to summarize news articles according to a specified constraint and cluster them to identify key events to include in a constrained timeline. In addition, we propose a novel self-reflection method during summary generation, demonstrating that this approach successfully leads to improved performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address an important gap in creating children's stories for vocabulary enrichment, we investigate the automatic evaluation of how well stories convey the semantics of target vocabulary words, a task with substantial implications for generating educational content. We motivate this task, which we call measuring contextual informativeness in children's stories, and provide a formal task definition as well as a dataset for the task. We further propose a method for automating the task using a large language model (LLM). Our experiments show that our approach reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.4983 with human judgments of informativeness, while the strongest baseline only obtains a correlation of 0.3534. An additional analysis shows that the LLM-based approach is able to generalize to measuring contextual informativeness in adult-directed text, on which it also outperforms all baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17451">Diving into Self-Evolving Training for Multimodal Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Junlong Li, Xiwen Zhang, Fan Zhou, Yu Cheng, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning ability is essential for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In the absence of multimodal chain-of-thought annotated data, self-evolving training, where the model learns from its own outputs, has emerged as an effective and scalable approach for enhancing reasoning abilities. Despite its growing usage, a comprehensive understanding of self-evolving training, particularly in the context of multimodal reasoning, remains limited. In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning, pinpointing three key factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. We systematically examine each factor and explore how various configurations affect the training's effectiveness. Our analysis leads to a set of best practices for each factor, aimed at optimizing multimodal reasoning. Furthermore, we explore the Self-Evolution Dynamics during training and the impact of automatic balancing mechanisms in boosting performance. After all the investigations, we present a final recipe for self-evolving training in multimodal reasoning, encapsulating these design choices into a framework we call MSTaR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), which is universally effective for models with different sizes on various benchmarks, e.g., surpassing the pre-evolved model significantly on 5 multimodal reasoning benchmarks without using additional human annotations, as demonstrated on MiniCPM-V-2.5 (8B), Phi-3.5-Vision (4B) and InternVL2 (2B). We believe this study fills a significant gap in the understanding of self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning and offers a robust framework for future research. Our policy and reward models, as well as the collected data, is released to facilitate further investigation in multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-generative agent systems (MGASs) have become a research hotspot since the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, with the continuous influx of new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies.

We provide an overview of the various applications of MGAS in (i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii) evaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight several challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlong Deng, Zhisong Zhang, Kelong Mao, Shuaiyi Li, Xinting Huang, Dong Yu, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough investigation of gist-based context compression methods to improve long-context processing in large language models. We focus on two key questions: (1) How well can these methods replace full attention models? and (2) What potential failure patterns arise due to compression? Through extensive experiments, we show that while gist-based compression can achieve near-lossless performance on tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and long-document QA, it faces challenges in tasks like synthetic recall. Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way. To mitigate these issues, we propose two effective strategies: fine-grained autoencoding, which enhances the reconstruction of original token information, and segment-wise token importance estimation, which adjusts optimization based on token dependencies. Our work provides valuable insights into the understanding of gist token-based context compression and offers practical strategies for improving compression capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17498">DRT-o1: Optimized Deep Reasoning Translation via Long Chain-of-Thought</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore. Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness. The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Hao Li, Junda Zhu, Xinyuan Wang, Chengwei Pan, MinLie Huang, Lei Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful content when prompted with carefully crafted inputs, a vulnerability known as LLM jailbreaking. As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle Saunders, Steve DeNeefe</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models can be specialized by domain adaptation, often involving fine-tuning on a dataset of interest. This process risks catastrophic forgetting: rapid loss of generic translation quality. Forgetting has been widely observed, with many mitigation methods proposed. However, the causes of forgetting and the relationship between forgetting and adaptation data are under-explored.
  This paper takes a novel approach to understanding catastrophic forgetting during NMT adaptation by investigating the impact of the data. We provide a first investigation of what is forgotten, and why. We examine the relationship between forgetting and the in-domain data, and show that the amount and type of forgetting is linked to that data's target vocabulary coverage. Our findings pave the way toward better informed NMT domain adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning the Qwen2-1.5B model for Arabic language processing using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on a system with only 4GB VRAM. We detail the process of adapting this large language model to the Arabic domain, using diverse datasets including Bactrian, OpenAssistant, and Wikipedia Arabic corpora. Our methodology involves custom data preprocessing, model configuration, and training optimization techniques such as gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training. We address specific challenges in Arabic NLP, including morphological complexity, dialectal variations, and diacritical mark handling. Experimental results over 10,000 training steps show significant performance improvements, with the final loss converging to 0.1083. We provide comprehensive analysis of GPU memory usage, training dynamics, and model evaluation across various Arabic language tasks, including text classification, question answering, and dialect identification. The fine-tuned model demonstrates robustness to input perturbations and improved handling of Arabic-specific linguistic phenomena. This research contributes to multilingual AI by demonstrating a resource-efficient approach for creating specialized language models, potentially democratizing access to advanced NLP technologies for diverse linguistic communities. Our work paves the way for future research in low-resource language adaptation and efficient fine-tuning of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: \textit{Query Optimization} (QO) refers to techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency and quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and answering queries, especially complex ones in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, RAG mitigates the limitations of LLMs by dynamically retrieving and leveraging up-to-date relevant information, which provides a cost-effective solution to the challenge of LLMs producing plausible but potentially inaccurate responses. Recently, as RAG evolves and incorporates multiple components that influence its performance, QO has emerged as a critical element, playing a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of RAG's retrieval stage in accurately sourcing the necessary multiple pieces of evidence to answer queries correctly. In this paper, we trace the evolution of QO techniques by summarizing and analyzing significant studies. Through an organized framework and categorization, we aim to consolidate existing QO techniques in RAG, elucidate their technological foundations, and highlight their potential to enhance the versatility and applications of LLMs.</p>

We further refined the dataset through a human evaluation phase, addressing linguistic inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy in code-switching, phonetic representations, and synonym variability. The resulting dataset captures Roman Urdu's diverse linguistic features and serves as a critical resource for machine translation, sentiment analysis, and multilingual education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer architectures are increasingly effective at processing and generating very long chunks of texts, opening new perspectives for document-level machine translation (MT). In this work, we challenge the ability of MT systems to handle texts comprising up to several thousands of tokens. We design and implement a new approach designed to precisely measure the effect of length increments on MT outputs. Our experiments with two representative architectures unambiguously show that (a)~translation performance decreases with the length of the input text; (b)~the position of sentences within the document matters and translation quality is higher for sentences occurring earlier in a document. We further show that manipulating the distribution of document lengths and of positional embeddings only marginally mitigates such problems. Our results suggest that even though document-level MT is computationally feasible, it does not yet match the performance of sentence-based MT.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in scientific tasks, existing evaluation frameworks primarily assess their performance using rich contextual inputs, overlooking their ability to generate novel ideas from minimal information. We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores. These findings highlight the importance of specialized evaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the development of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories than traditional problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijbren van Vaals, Yevgen Matusevych, Frank Tsiwah</p>
<p>Abstract: Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia characterized by non-fluent, effortful and fragmented speech production with relatively good comprehension. Since traditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural language processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could potentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches. To address this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences. We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's aphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input utterances. Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing communication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other clinical populations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Richardson, Vivek Srikumar, Ashish Sabharwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic expression that characterizes its semantics? How do the semantics of two losses relate to each other? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful guidance to those working on human AI alignment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17701">From Models to Microtheories: Distilling a Model&#x27;s Topical Knowledge for Grounded Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Weir, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Orion Weller, Oyvind Tafjord, Sam Hornstein, Alexander Sabol, Peter Jansen, Benjamin Van Durme, Peter Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reasoning methods (e.g., chain-of-thought, entailment reasoning) help users understand how language models (LMs) answer a single question, but they do little to reveal the LM's overall understanding, or "theory," about the question's $\textit{topic}$, making it still hard to trust the model. Our goal is to materialize such theories - here called $\textit{microtheories}$ (a linguistic analog of logical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM's core knowledge about a topic. These statements systematically work together to entail answers to a $\textit{set}$ of questions to both engender trust and improve performance. Our approach is to first populate a knowledge store with (model-generated) sentences that entail answers to training questions and then distill those down to a core microtheory that is concise, general, and non-redundant. We show that, when added to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), microtheories can supply critical, topical information not necessarily present in the corpus, improving both a model's ability to ground its answers to verifiable knowledge (i.e., show how answers are systematically entailed by documents in the corpus, fully grounding up to +8% more answers), and the accuracy of those grounded answers (up to +8% absolute). We also show that, in a human evaluation in the medical domain, our distilled microtheories contain a significantly higher concentration of topically critical facts than the non-distilled knowledge store. Finally, we show we can quantify the coverage of a microtheory for a topic (characterized by a dataset) using a notion of $p$-relevance. Together, these suggest that microtheories are an efficient distillation of an LM's topic-relevant knowledge, that they can usefully augment existing corpora, and can provide both performance gains and an interpretable, verifiable window into the model's knowledge of a topic.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17727">Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.
  In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

<p>Abstract: Existing humor datasets and evaluations predominantly focus on English, leaving limited resources for culturally nuanced humor in non-English languages like Chinese. To address this gap, we construct Chumor, the first Chinese humor explanation dataset that exceeds the size of existing humor datasets. Chumor is sourced from Ruo Zhi Ba, a Chinese Reddit-like platform known for sharing intellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes. We test ten LLMs through direct and chain-of-thought prompting, revealing that Chumor poses significant challenges to existing LLMs, with their accuracy slightly above random and far below human. In addition, our analysis highlights that human-annotated humor explanations are significantly better than those generated by GPT-4o and ERNIE-4-turbo. We release Chumor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/dnaihao/Chumor, our project page is at https://dnaihao.github.io/Chumor-dataset/, our leaderboard is at https://huggingface.co/spaces/dnaihao/Chumor, and our codebase is at https://github.com/dnaihao/Chumor-dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective pre-training of large language models (LLMs) has been challenging due to the immense resource demands and the complexity of the technical processes involved. This paper presents a detailed technical report on YuLan-Mini, a highly capable base model with 2.42B parameters that achieves top-tier performance among models of similar parameter scale. Our pre-training approach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical contributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data schedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted data selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on 1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that require significantly more data.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17747">Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam</p>
<p>Abstract: Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: ARC Challenge appears more difficult than ARC Easy for modern LLMs primarily due to an evaluation setup that prevents direct comparison of answer choices rather than inherent complexity. Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haofei Yu, Zhaochen Hong, Zirui Cheng, Kunlun Zhu, Keyang Xuan, Jinwei Yao, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel A. Olowe, Danial Chitnis</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danush Venkateshperumal, Rahman Abdul Rafi, Shakil Ahmed, Ashfaq Khokhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency communication systems face disruptions due to packet loss, bandwidth constraints, poor signal quality, delays, and jitter in VoIP systems, leading to degraded real-time service quality. Victims in distress often struggle to convey critical information due to panic, speech disorders, and background noise, further complicating dispatchers' ability to assess situations accurately. Staffing shortages in emergency centers exacerbate delays in coordination and assistance. This paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by reconstructing incomplete speech, filling contextual gaps, and prioritizing calls based on severity. The system integrates real-time transcription with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextual responses, using Twilio and AssemblyAI APIs for seamless implementation. Evaluation shows high precision, favorable BLEU and ROUGE scores, and alignment with real-world needs, demonstrating the model's potential to optimize emergency response workflows and prioritize critical cases effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkatraman Manikandan, Suresh Neethirajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deciphering the acoustic language of chickens offers new opportunities in animal welfare and ecological informatics. Their subtle vocal signals encode health conditions, emotional states, and dynamic interactions within ecosystems. Understanding the semantics of these calls provides a valuable tool for interpreting their functional vocabulary and clarifying how each sound serves a specific purpose in social and environmental contexts. We apply advanced Natural Language Processing and transformer based models to translate bioacoustic data into meaningful insights. Our method integrates Wave2Vec 2.0 for raw audio feature extraction with a fine tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, pretrained on a broad corpus of animal sounds and adapted to poultry tasks. This pipeline decodes poultry vocalizations into interpretable categories including distress calls, feeding signals, and mating vocalizations, revealing emotional nuances often overlooked by conventional analyses. Achieving 92 percent accuracy in classifying key vocalization types, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of real time automated monitoring of flock health and stress. By tracking this functional vocabulary, farmers can respond proactively to environmental or behavioral changes, improving poultry welfare, reducing stress related productivity losses, and supporting more sustainable farm management. Beyond agriculture, this research enhances our understanding of computational ecology. Accessing the semantic foundation of animal calls may indicate biodiversity, environmental stressors, and species interactions, informing integrative ecosystem level decision making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce LSH-E, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. LSH-E quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, LSH-E makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, LSH-E is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that LSH-E can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current state-of-the-art video generative models can produce commercial-grade videos with highly realistic details. However, they still struggle to coherently present multiple sequential events in the stories specified by the prompts, which is foreseeable an essential capability for future long video generation scenarios. For example, top T2V generative models still fail to generate a video of the short simple story 'how to put an elephant into a refrigerator.' While existing detail-oriented benchmarks primarily focus on fine-grained metrics like aesthetic quality and spatial-temporal consistency, they fall short of evaluating models' abilities to handle event-level story presentation. To address this gap, we introduce StoryEval, a story-oriented benchmark specifically designed to assess text-to-video (T2V) models' story-completion capabilities. StoryEval features 423 prompts spanning 7 classes, each representing short stories composed of 2-4 consecutive events. We employ advanced vision-language models, such as GPT-4V and LLaVA-OV-Chat-72B, to verify the completion of each event in the generated videos, applying a unanimous voting method to enhance reliability. Our methods ensure high alignment with human evaluations, and the evaluation of 11 models reveals its challenge, with none exceeding an average story-completion rate of 50%. StoryEval provides a new benchmark for advancing T2V models and highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing next-generation solutions for coherent story-driven video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that has been widely adopted in various downstream applications of LLMs. Together with the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) technique, fine-tuning approaches have shown remarkable improvements in model capability. However, the coordination of multiple experts in existing studies solely relies on the weights assigned by the simple router function. Lack of communication and collaboration among experts exacerbate the instability of LLMs due to the imbalance load problem of MoE. To address this issue, we propose a novel MoE graph-based LLM fine-tuning framework GraphLoRA, in which a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts by graph neural networks (GNNs). GraphLoRA enables all experts to understand input knowledge and share information from neighbor experts by aggregating operations. Besides, to enhance each expert's capability and their collaborations, we design two novel coordination strategies: the Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy and the Normal distribution-based load balance strategy. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphLoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in the graph router of GraphLoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to the reliability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5. This paper presents Adversarial Robustness through Dynamic Ensemble Learning (ARDEL), a novel scheme designed to enhance the robustness of PLMs against such attacks. ARDEL leverages the diversity of multiple PLMs and dynamically adjusts the ensemble configuration based on input characteristics and detected adversarial patterns. Key components of ARDEL include a meta-model for dynamic weighting, an adversarial pattern detection module, and adversarial training with regularization techniques. Comprehensive evaluations using standardized datasets and various adversarial attack scenarios demonstrate that ARDEL significantly improves robustness compared to existing methods. By dynamically reconfiguring the ensemble to prioritize the most robust models for each input, ARDEL effectively reduces attack success rates and maintains higher accuracy under adversarial conditions. This work contributes to the broader goal of developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems for real-world NLP applications, offering a practical and scalable solution to enhance adversarial resilience in PLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have predominantly focused on maximizing accuracy and reasoning capabilities, often overlooking crucial computational efficiency considerations. While this approach has yielded impressive accuracy improvements, it has led to methods that may be impractical for real-world deployment due to computational overhead and latency constraints. This paper investigates the potential synergy between reasoning enhancement and computational efficiency by analyzing the integration of two contrasting approaches: Quiet-STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) and REBASE (REward BAlanced SEarch). Through comprehensive empirical analysis using the Mistral-7B model on the GSM8K dataset, we demonstrate that while each method excels in its primary objective-Quiet-STaR achieving superior accuracy (32.03%) despite high computational cost (554.66s runtime, 12.73T FLOPs), and REBASE providing exceptional efficiency (8.47s runtime, 2.35T FLOPs) while maintaining baseline-comparable accuracy (10.94%)-their integration reveals fundamental challenges in reconciling reasoning depth with computational efficiency. The combined approach unexpectedly results in degraded performance (9.38% accuracy, 143.66s runtime), highlighting critical insights about the complex interplay between reasoning enhancement and efficiency optimization in LLMs. Our findings illuminate the need for novel architectures and algorithms specifically designed to bridge the gap between these competing objectives, while providing concrete directions for future research in compute-efficient reasoning methods.</p>

While existing work with LLMs like GPT-4 has shown impressive results, real breakthroughs could arise from leveraging SLMs as they offer the advantage of being deployable locally, ensuring patient data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations. This study benchmarks several SLMs against LLMs for summarizing patient-reported Q\&A forms in the context of radiotherapy. Using various metrics, we evaluate their precision and reliability. The findings highlight both the promise and limitations of SLMs for high-stakes medical tasks, fostering more efficient and privacy-preserving AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid identification of medical emergencies through digital communication channels remains a critical challenge in modern healthcare delivery, particularly with the increasing prevalence of telemedicine. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering techniques for automated emergency detection in medical communications. We developed and evaluated a comprehensive system using multiple LLaMA model variants (1B, 3B, and 7B parameters) to classify medical scenarios as emergency or non-emergency situations. Our methodology incorporated both system prompts and in-prompt training approaches, evaluated across different hardware configurations. The results demonstrate exceptional performance, with the LLaMA 2 (7B) model achieving 99.7% accuracy and the LLaMA 3.2 (3B) model reaching 99.6% accuracy with optimal prompt engineering. Through systematic testing of training examples within the prompts, we identified that including 10 example scenarios in the model prompts yielded optimal classification performance. Processing speeds varied significantly between platforms, ranging from 0.05 to 2.2 seconds per request. The system showed particular strength in minimizing high-risk false negatives in emergency scenarios, which is crucial for patient safety. The code implementation and evaluation framework are publicly available on GitHub, facilitating further research and development in this crucial area of healthcare technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Zhou, Ruiyi Zhang, Yufan Zhou, Changyou Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models still struggle with text-rich images because of inadequate training data. Self-Instruct provides an annotation-free way for generating instruction data, but its quality is poor, as multimodal alignment remains a hurdle even for the largest models. In this work, we propose LLaVAR-2, to enhance multimodal alignment for text-rich images through hybrid instruction generation between human annotators and large language models. Specifically, it involves detailed image captions from human annotators, followed by the use of these annotations in tailored text prompts for GPT-4o to curate a dataset. It also implements several mechanisms to filter out low-quality data, and the resulting dataset comprises 424k high-quality pairs of instructions. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on this dataset exhibit impressive enhancements over those trained with self-instruct data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce REFA, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses more strongly, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA), naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. By contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA sets a new state-of-the-art among reference-free alignment methods, producing richer responses aligned more closely with human preferences. Compared to a base supervised fine-tuned (SFT) mistral-7b model that achieves 8.4% length-controlled win rate (LC-WR) and 6.2% win rate (WR), our best REFA configuration attains 21.62% LC-WR and 19.87% WR on the AlpacaEval v2 benchmark. This represents a substantial improvement over both the strongest multi-preference baseline, InfoNCA (16.82% LC-WR, 10.44% WR), and the strongest reference-free baseline, SimPO (20.01% LC-WR, 17.65% WR)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Sandoval, Mohammed Abuhamad, Patrick Furman, Mujtaba Nazari, Deborah L. Hall, Yasin N. Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media has revolutionized communication, allowing people worldwide to connect and interact instantly. However, it has also led to increases in cyberbullying, which poses a significant threat to children and adolescents globally, affecting their mental health and well-being. It is critical to accurately detect the roles of individuals involved in cyberbullying incidents to effectively address the issue on a large scale. This study explores the use of machine learning models to detect the roles involved in cyberbullying interactions. After examining the AMiCA dataset and addressing class imbalance issues, we evaluate the performance of various models built with four underlying LLMs (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT-2) for role detection. Our analysis shows that oversampling techniques help improve model performance. The best model, a fine-tuned RoBERTa using oversampled data, achieved an overall F1 score of 83.5%, increasing to 89.3% after applying a prediction threshold. The top-2 F1 score without thresholding was 95.7%. Our method outperforms previously proposed models. After investigating the per-class model performance and confidence scores, we show that the models perform well in classes with more samples and less contextual confusion (e.g., Bystander Other), but struggle with classes with fewer samples (e.g., Bystander Assistant) and more contextual ambiguity (e.g., Harasser and Victim). This work highlights current strengths and limitations in the development of accurate models with limited data and complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Ye, Ankan Dash, Wenpeng Yin, Guiling Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Flowcharts are typically presented as images, driving the trend of using vision-language models (VLMs) for end-to-end flowchart understanding. However, two key challenges arise: (i) Limited controllability--users have minimal influence over the downstream task, as they can only modify input images, while the training of VLMs is often out of reach for most researchers. (ii) Lack of explainability--it is difficult to trace VLM errors to specific causes, such as failures in visual encoding or reasoning. We propose TextFlow, addressing aforementioned issues with two stages: (i) Vision Textualizer--which generates textual representations from flowchart images; and (ii) Textual Reasoner--which performs question-answering based on the text representations. TextFlow offers three key advantages: (i) users can select the type of text representations (e.g., Graphviz, Mermaid, PlantUML), or further convert them into executable graph object to call tools, enhancing performance and controllability; (ii) it improves explainability by helping to attribute errors more clearly to visual or textual processing components; and (iii) it promotes the modularization of the solution, such as allowing advanced LLMs to be used in the Reasoner stage when VLMs underperform in end-to-end fashion. Experiments on the FlowVQA and FlowLearn benchmarks demonstrate TextFlow's state-of-the-art performance as well as its robustness. All code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Zhuo Zhang, Yi Zhang, Yuanzhao Zhai, Hanyang Peng, Yu Lei, Yue Yu, Hui Wang, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in AI alignment techniques have significantly improved the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with static human preferences. However, the dynamic nature of human preferences can render some prior training data outdated or even erroneous, ultimately causing LLMs to deviate from contemporary human preferences and societal norms. Existing methodologies, whether they involve the curation of new data for continual alignment or the manual correction of outdated data for re-alignment, demand costly human resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, Large Language Model Behavior Correction with Influence Function Recall and Post-Training (LANCET), which requires no human involvement. LANCET consists of two phases: (1) using influence functions to identify the training data that significantly impact undesirable model outputs, and (2) applying an Influence function-driven Bregman Optimization (IBO) technique to adjust the model's behavior based on these influence distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that LANCET effectively and efficiently correct inappropriate behaviors of LLMs. Furthermore, LANCET can outperform methods that rely on collecting human preferences, and it enhances the interpretability of learning human preferences within LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shao-Syuan Huang, Kuan-Po Huang, Andy T. Liu, Hung-yi Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to recognize and transcribe speech from multiple languages within a single system. Whisper, one of the most advanced ASR models, excels in this domain by handling 99 languages effectively, leveraging a vast amount of data and incorporating language tags as prefixes to guide the recognition process. However, despite its success, Whisper struggles with unseen languages, those not included in its pre-training. Motivated by the observation that many languages share linguistic characteristics, we propose methods that exploit these relationships to enhance ASR performance on unseen languages. Specifically, we introduce a weighted sum method, which computes a weighted sum of the embeddings of language tags, using Whisper's predicted language probabilities. In addition, we develop a predictor-based approach that refines the weighted sum embedding to more closely approximate the true embedding for unseen languages. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR performance, both in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Our proposed methods outperform baseline approaches, providing an effective solution for addressing unseen languages in multilingual ASR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanjim Bin Faruk</p>
<p>Abstract: The vast majority of cybersecurity information is unstructured text, including critical data within databases such as CVE, NVD, CWE, CAPEC, and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. These databases are invaluable for analyzing attack patterns and understanding attacker behaviors. Creating a knowledge graph by integrating this information could unlock significant insights. However, processing this large amount of data requires advanced deep-learning techniques. A crucial step towards building such a knowledge graph is developing a robust mechanism for automating the extraction of answers to specific questions from the unstructured text. Question Answering (QA) systems play a pivotal role in this process by pinpointing and extracting precise information, facilitating the mapping of relationships between various data points. In the cybersecurity context, QA systems encounter unique challenges due to the need to interpret and answer questions based on a wide array of domain-specific information. To tackle these challenges, it is necessary to develop a cybersecurity-specific dataset and train a machine learning model on it, aimed at enhancing the understanding and retrieval of domain-specific information. This paper presents a novel dataset and describes a machine learning model trained on this dataset for the QA task. It also discusses the model's performance and key findings in a manner that maintains a balance between formality and accessibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Do June Min, Karel Mundnich, Andy Lapastora, Erfan Soltanmohammadi, Srikanth Ronanki, Kyu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Goncalves, Prashant Mathur, Xing Niu, Brady Houston, Chandrashekhar Lavania, Srikanth Vishnubhotla, Lijia Sun, Anthony Ferritto</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation typically prioritizes improving translation quality and naturalness. However, an equally critical aspect in audio-visual content is lip-synchrony-ensuring that the movements of the lips match the spoken content-essential for maintaining realism in dubbed videos. Despite its importance, the inclusion of lip-synchrony constraints in AVS2S models has been largely overlooked. This study addresses this gap by integrating a lip-synchrony loss into the training process of AVS2S models. Our proposed method significantly enhances lip-synchrony in direct audio-visual speech-to-speech translation, achieving an average LSE-D score of 10.67, representing a 9.2% reduction in LSE-D over a strong baseline across four language pairs. Additionally, it maintains the naturalness and high quality of the translated speech when overlaid onto the original video, without any degradation in translation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao-Chi Chen, Chin-Yuan Yeh, Hsi-Wen Chen, De-Nian Yang, Ming-Syan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts (kNoT): a prompt scheme that advances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond existing paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT). The key innovation of kNoT is the LLM Workflow Template (LWT), which allows for an executable plan to be specified by LLMs for LLMs. LWT allows these plans to be arbitrary networks, where single-step LLM operations are nodes, and edges correspond to message passing between these steps. Furthermore, LWT supports selection of individual elements through indexing, facilitating kNoT to produce intricate plans where each LLM operation can be limited to elementary operations, greatly enhancing reliability over extended task sequences. We demonstrate that kNoT significantly outperforms the state of the art on six use cases, while reducing the need for extensive prompt engineering. For instance, kNoT finds 92% accuracy for sorting 32 numbers over 12% and 31% for ToT and GoT, while utilizing up to 84.4% and 87.3% less task-specific prompts, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Yashima, Ryosuke Korekata, Komei Sugiura</p>
<p>Abstract: Growing labor shortages are increasing the demand for domestic service robots (DSRs) to assist in various settings. In this study, we develop a DSR that transports everyday objects to specified pieces of furniture based on open-vocabulary instructions. Our approach focuses on retrieving images of target objects and receptacles from pre-collected images of indoor environments. For example, given an instruction "Please get the right red towel hanging on the metal towel rack and put it in the white washing machine on the left," the DSR is expected to carry the red towel to the washing machine based on the retrieved images. This is challenging because the correct images should be retrieved from thousands of collected images, which may include many images of similar towels and appliances. To address this, we propose RelaX-Former, which learns diverse and robust representations from among positive, unlabeled positive, and negative samples. We evaluated RelaX-Former on a dataset containing real-world indoor images and human annotated instructions including complex referring expressions. The experimental results demonstrate that RelaX-Former outperformed existing baseline models across standard image retrieval metrics. Moreover, we performed physical experiments using a DSR to evaluate the performance of our approach in a zero-shot transfer setting. The experiments involved the DSR to carry objects to specific receptacles based on open-vocabulary instructions, achieving an overall success rate of 75%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the recent advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, most retrieval methodologies are often developed for factual retrieval, which assumes query and positive documents are semantically similar. In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks. Our codes, models, and datasets are available on https://github.com/flyfree5/LaHoRe.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly being deployed as conversational assistants capable of performing complex real-world tasks through tool integration. This enhanced ability to interact with external systems and process various data sources, while powerful, introduces significant security vulnerabilities. In particular, indirect prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat, where malicious instructions embedded within external data sources can manipulate agents to deviate from user intentions. While existing defenses based on rule constraints, source spotlighting, and authentication protocols show promise, they struggle to maintain robust security while preserving task functionality. We propose a novel and orthogonal perspective that reframes agent security from preventing harmful actions to ensuring task alignment, requiring every agent action to serve user objectives. Based on this insight, we develop Task Shield, a test-time defense mechanism that systematically verifies whether each instruction and tool call contributes to user-specified goals. Through experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark, we demonstrate that Task Shield reduces attack success rates (2.07\%) while maintaining high task utility (69.79\%) on GPT-4o.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have flourished the development of highly adept Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate diverse data types to empower decision-making. Among these, Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications are promising for their capability to combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including biomedical research. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG pipeline tool for biomedical research use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's disease from PubMed articles. Our pipeline incorporates multimodal fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Preliminary experimental results against benchmarks, such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have returned improved results in information retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also demonstrate a case study with our RAG pipeline across different Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination. Overall, a reduction in cognitive task load is observed, which allows researchers to gain multimodal insights, improving understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce KALL-E, a novel autoregressive (AR) language modeling approach with next-distribution prediction for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models and predicts the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text without relying on VAE- or diffusion-based components. Specifically, we use WaveVAE to extract continuous speech distributions from waveforms instead of using discrete speech tokens. A single AR language model predicts these continuous speech distributions from text, with a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as the constraint. Experimental results show that KALL-E outperforms open-source implementations of YourTTS, VALL-E, NaturalSpeech 2, and CosyVoice in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS scenarios. Moreover, KALL-E demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities in emotion and accent cloning. Importantly, KALL-E presents a more straightforward and effective paradigm for using continuous speech representations in TTS.

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives. However, by default, they tend to generate "average" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - "PsychAdapter" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology.</p>

We explore a speech-based transfer learning approach that uses a lightweight encoder and that transfers only the encoder weights, enabling a simplified run-time model. Our study uses a large data set containing roughly two orders of magnitude more speakers and sessions than used in prior work. The large data set enables reliable estimation of improvement from transfer learning. Results for the prediction of PHQ-8 labels show up to 27% relative performance gains for binary classification; these gains are statistically significant with a p-value close to zero. Improvements were also found for regression. Additionally, the gain from transfer learning does not appear to require strong source task performance. Results suggest that this approach is flexible and offers promise for efficient implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur, Kesha A. Patel, Audrey Poon, Shuqi Cui, Nazif Azizi, Rishika Shah, Riyan Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Community Sentiment and Engagement Index (CSEI), developed to capture nuanced public sentiment and engagement variations on social media, particularly in response to major events related to COVID-19. Constructed with diverse sentiment indicators, CSEI integrates features like engagement, daily post count, compound sentiment, fine-grain sentiments (fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral), readability, offensiveness, and domain diversity. Each component is systematically weighted through a multi-step Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based framework, prioritizing features according to their variance contributions across temporal sentiment shifts. This approach dynamically adjusts component importance, enabling CSEI to precisely capture high-sensitivity shifts in public sentiment. The development of CSEI showed statistically significant correlations with its constituent features, underscoring internal consistency and sensitivity to specific sentiment dimensions. CSEI's responsiveness was validated using a dataset of 4,510,178 Reddit posts about COVID-19. The analysis focused on 15 major events, including the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the first reported cases of COVID-19 across different countries, national lockdowns, vaccine developments, and crucial public health measures. Cumulative changes in CSEI revealed prominent peaks and valleys aligned with these events, indicating significant patterns in public sentiment across different phases of the pandemic. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed a statistically significant relationship between CSEI daily fluctuations and these events (p = 0.0428), highlighting the capacity of CSEI to infer and interpret shifts in public sentiment and engagement in response to major events related to COVID-19.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zheng, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Peng Yu, Qingwei Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for sequential recommendation, which predicts users' future interactions based on their past behavior. We introduce a new concept, "Integrating Recommendation Systems as a New Language in Large Models" (RSLLM), which combines the strengths of traditional recommenders and LLMs. RSLLM uses a unique prompting method that combines ID-based item embeddings from conventional recommendation models with textual item features. It treats users' sequential behaviors as a distinct language and aligns the ID embeddings with the LLM's input space using a projector. We also propose a two-stage LLM fine-tuning framework that refines a pretrained LLM using a combination of two contrastive losses and a language modeling loss. The LLM is first fine-tuned using text-only prompts, followed by target domain fine-tuning with unified prompts. This trains the model to incorporate behavioral knowledge from the traditional sequential recommender into the LLM. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanqia Cai, Yijun Yang, Zhifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1\% on GSM8K and 32.5\% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander von Recum, Christoph Schnabl, Gabor Hollbeck, Silas Alberti, Philip Blinde, Marvin von Hagen</p>
<p>Abstract: Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs.
  We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification.
  Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hankun Wang, Haoran Wang, Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Chenpeng Du, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangbo Yu, Jinhua Zhao, Luis Miranda-Moreno, Matthew Korp</p>
<p>Abstract: Surveys and interviews (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured) are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by large language models (LLMs). However, as public investments and policies on infrastructure and services often involve substantial public stakes and environmental risks, there is a need for a rigorous, transparent, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient development framework tailored for such major decision-making processes. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resultant parameterized process for designing conversational agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic in the proposed approach. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) transportation expert consultation about future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript post-processing. The results show the effectiveness of this modular approach and how it addresses key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns, setting the stage for the next-generation surveys and interviews.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieving semantically relevant documents in niche domains poses significant challenges for traditional TF-IDF-based systems, often resulting in low similarity scores and suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing an iterative and semi-automated query refinement methodology tailored to Humber College's career services webpages. Initially, generic queries related to interview preparation yield low top-document similarities (approximately 0.2--0.3). To enhance retrieval effectiveness, we implement a two-fold approach: first, domain-aware query refinement by incorporating specialized terms such as resources-online-learning, student-online-services, and career-advising; second, the integration of structured educational descriptors like "online resume and interview improvement tools." Additionally, we automate the extraction of domain-specific keywords from top-ranked documents to suggest relevant terms for query expansion. Through experiments conducted on five baseline queries, our semi-automated iterative refinement process elevates the average top similarity score from approximately 0.18 to 0.42, marking a substantial improvement in retrieval performance. The implementation details, including reproducible code and experimental setups, are made available in our GitHub repositories \url{https://github.com/Elipei88/HumberChatbotBackend} and \url{https://github.com/Nisarg851/HumberChatbot}. We also discuss the limitations of our approach and propose future directions, including the integration of advanced neural retrieval models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of speech temporal dynamics in application to automatic speaker verification and speaker voice anonymization tasks. We propose several metrics to perform automatic speaker verification based only on phoneme durations. Experimental results demonstrate that phoneme durations leak some speaker information and can reveal speaker identity from both original and anonymized speech. Thus, this work emphasizes the importance of taking into account the speaker's speech rate and, more importantly, the speaker's phonetic duration characteristics, as well as the need to modify them in order to develop anonymization systems with strong privacy protection capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanessa Su, Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a data-driven analysis of COVID-19 discourse on YouTube, examining the sentiment, toxicity, and thematic patterns of video content published between January 2023 and October 2024. The analysis involved applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with VADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32% of video descriptions were positive, 36.63% were neutral, and 14.05% were negative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in pandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91% of content as toxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed two main themes, with 66.74% of the videos covering general health information and pandemic-related impacts and 33.26% focused on news and real-time updates, highlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system was also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by sentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned video recommendations. This system achieved 69% aggregate coverage, with monthly coverage rates consistently above 85%, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed coverage reaching 69% for five video recommendations and 79% for ten video recommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for understanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that supports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content related to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about machine-generated text (MGT), including ethical and practical issues like plagiarism and misinformation. Building a robust and highly generalizable MGT detection system has become increasingly important. This work investigates the generalization capabilities of MGT detectors in three aspects: First, we construct MGTAcademic, a large-scale dataset focused on academic writing, featuring human-written texts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with an extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we investigate the transferability of detectors across domains and LLMs, leveraging fine-grained datasets to reveal insights into domain transferring and implementing few-shot techniques to improve the performance by roughly 13.2%. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models must adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data and benchmark detectors. We implement several adapting techniques to improve the performance by roughly 10% and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zeng, Yuzhen Huang, Lulu Zhao, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks, self-improvement -- where models are trained on their own outputs -- has emerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. However, the critical factors underlying the mechanism of these iterative self-improving methods remain poorly understood, such as under what conditions self-improvement is effective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations. In this work, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors in this iterative process: (1) the model's ability to generate sufficiently diverse responses (exploration); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in distinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones (exploitation). Using mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a quantitative analysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering that a model's exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations, and the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well. Motivated by these findings, we introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning framework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance exploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that B-STaR not only enhances the model's exploratory capabilities throughout training but also achieves a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to superior performance.</p>

GitHub issue resolving is a key challenge among these tasks. While recent approaches have made progress on this task, they focus on textual data within issues, neglecting visual data. However, this visual data is crucial for resolving issues as it conveys additional knowledge that text alone cannot. We propose CodeV, the first approach to leveraging visual data to enhance the issue-resolving capabilities of LLMs. CodeV resolves each issue by following a two-phase process: data processing and patch generation. To evaluate CodeV, we construct a benchmark for visual issue resolving, namely Visual SWE-bench. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeV, as well as provide valuable insights into leveraging visual data to resolve GitHub issues.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how infants perceive speech sounds and language structures is still an open problem. Previous research in artificial neural networks has mainly focused on large dataset-dependent generative models, aiming to replicate language-related phenomena such as ''perceptual narrowing''. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using a small-sized generative neural network equipped with a continual learning mechanism based on predictive coding for mono-and bilingual speech sound learning (referred to as language sound acquisition during ''critical period'') and a compositional optimization mechanism for generation where no learning is involved (later infancy sound imitation). Our model prioritizes interpretability and demonstrates the advantages of online learning: Unlike deep networks requiring substantial offline training, our model continuously updates with new data, making it adaptable and responsive to changing inputs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that if second language acquisition occurs during later infancy, the challenges associated with learning a foreign language after the critical period amplify, replicating the perceptual narrowing effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ege Yi\u{g}it \c{C}elik, Selma Tekir</p>
<p>Abstract: Citations are essential building blocks in scientific writing. The scientific community is longing for support in their generation. Citation generation involves two complementary subtasks: Determining the citation worthiness of a context and, if it's worth it, proposing the best candidate papers for the citation placeholder. The latter subtask is called local citation recommendation (LCR). This paper proposes CiteBART, a custom BART pre-training based on citation token masking to generate citations to achieve LCR. In the base scheme, we mask the citation token in the local citation context to make the citation prediction. In the global one, we concatenate the citing paper's title and abstract to the local citation context to learn to reconstruct the citation token. CiteBART outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the citation recommendation benchmarks except for the smallest FullTextPeerRead dataset. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv. We present a qualitative analysis and an ablation study to provide insights into the workings of CiteBART. Our analyses confirm that its generative nature brings about a zero-shot capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales show that, within varying context windows, FoPE can maintain a more stable perplexity and a more consistent accuracy in a needle-in-haystack task compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world repository-level code translation benchmark with an automatically executable test suite. We conduct experiments on RepoTransBench to evaluate the translation performance of 11 advanced LLMs. We find that the Success@1 score (test success in one attempt) of the best-performing LLM is only 7.33%. To further explore the potential of LLMs for repository-level code translation, we provide LLMs with error-related feedback to perform iterative debugging and observe an average 7.09% improvement on Success@1. However, even with this improvement, the Success@1 score of the best-performing LLM is only 21%, which may not meet the need for reliable automatic repository-level code translation. Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmiao Yu, Xiaocheng Feng, Yun Li, Minghui Liao, Ya-Qi Yu, Xiachong Feng, Weihong Zhong, Ruihan Chen, Mengkang Hu, Jihao Wu, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising reasoning capabilities on text-rich images from charts, tables, and documents. However, the abundant text within such images may increase the model's sensitivity to language. This raises the need to evaluate LVLM performance on cross-lingual text-rich visual inputs, where the language in the image differs from the language of the instructions. To address this, we introduce XT-VQA (Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Question Answering), a benchmark designed to assess how LVLMs handle language inconsistency between image text and questions. XT-VQA integrates five existing text-rich VQA datasets and a newly collected dataset, XPaperQA, covering diverse scenarios that require faithful recognition and comprehension of visual information despite language inconsistency. Our evaluation of prominent LVLMs on XT-VQA reveals a significant drop in performance for cross-lingual scenarios, even for models with multilingual capabilities. A mutual information analysis suggests that this performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately activate relevant visual information. To mitigate this issue, we propose MVCL-MI (Maximization of Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information), where a visual-text cross-lingual alignment is built by maximizing mutual information between the model's outputs and visual information. This is achieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher. Experimental results on the XT-VQA demonstrate that MVCL-MI effectively reduces the visual-text cross-lingual performance disparity while preserving the inherent capabilities of LVLMs, shedding new light on the potential practice for improving LVLMs. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Stardust-y/XTVQA.git</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadra Sabouri, Elnaz Rahmati, Soroush Gooran, Hossein Sameti</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance in low and mid-resource languages, such as Farsi, still lags behind resource-rich languages like English. To address this gap, we introduce naab, the largest publicly available, cleaned, and ready-to-use Farsi textual corpus. naab consists of 130GB of data, comprising over 250 million paragraphs and 15 billion words. Named after the Farsi word NAAB (meaning "pure" or "high-grade"), this corpus is openly accessible via Hugging Face, offering researchers a valuable resource for Farsi NLP tasks. In addition to naab, we provide naab-raw, an unprocessed version of the dataset, along with a pre-processing toolkit that allows users to clean their custom corpora. These resources empower NLP researchers and practitioners, particularly those focusing on low-resource languages, to improve the performance of LLMs in their respective domains and bridge the gap between resource-rich and resource-poor languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Davies, Jize Jiang, ChengXiang Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent successes of large, pretrained neural language models (LLMs), comparatively little is known about the representations of linguistic structure they learn during pretraining, which can lead to unexpected behaviors in response to prompt variation or distribution shift. To better understand these models and behaviors, we introduce a general model analysis framework to study LLMs with respect to their representation and use of human-interpretable linguistic properties. Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), is designed to investigate LLM competence in the context of specific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of different linguistic properties using causal probing, and measuring models' alignment under these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task. We also develop a new approach for performing causal probing interventions using gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range of properties and representations than prior techniques. Finally, we carry out a case study of CALM using these interventions to analyze and compare LLM competence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM can be used to explain behaviors across these tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianpeng Zhou, Wanjun Zhong, Yanlin Wang, Jiahai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability in handling reasoning tasks. However, unlike humans who can instinctively adapt their problem-solving strategies to the complexity of task, most LLM-based methods adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. These methods employ consistent models, sample sizes, prompting methods and levels of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. The inflexibility of these methods can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver (AS) framework tha dynamically adapts solving strategies to suit various problems, enabling the flexible allocation of test-time computational resources. The framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the reliability of the current solution using answer consistency. If the solution is deemed unreliable, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, various types of adaptation strategies are employed collaboratively. Through such dynamic and multi-faceted adaptations, our framework can help reduce computational consumption and improve performance. Experimental results from complex reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method can significantly reduce API costs (up to 85%) while maintaining original performance. Alternatively, it achieves up to 4.5% higher accuracy compared to the baselines at the same cost. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/john1226966735/Adaptive-Solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Yilong Chen, Wenyuan Zhang, Tianyun Liu, Siqi Wang, Tingwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread of generative artificial intelligence has heightened concerns about the potential harms posed by AI-generated texts, primarily stemming from factoid, unfair, and toxic content. Previous researchers have invested much effort in assessing the harmlessness of generative language models. However, existing benchmarks are struggling in the era of large language models (LLMs), due to the stronger language generation and instruction following capabilities, as well as wider applications. In this paper, we propose FFT, a new benchmark with 2116 elaborated-designed instances, for LLM harmlessness evaluation with factuality, fairness, and toxicity. To investigate the potential harms of LLMs, we evaluate 9 representative LLMs covering various parameter scales, training stages, and creators. Experiments show that the harmlessness of LLMs is still under-satisfactory, and extensive analysis derives some insightful findings that could inspire future research for harmless LLM research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zhang, Yuhua Zhao, Hang Gao, Mengting Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) serves as a fundamental task in natural language understanding, bearing direct implications for web content analysis, search engines, and information retrieval systems. Fine-tuned NER models exhibit satisfactory performance on standard NER benchmarks. However, due to limited fine-tuning data and lack of knowledge, it performs poorly on unseen entity recognition. As a result, the usability and reliability of NER models in web-related applications are compromised. Instead, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 possess extensive external knowledge, but research indicates that they lack specialty for NER tasks. Furthermore, non-public and large-scale weights make tuning LLMs difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that combines small fine-tuned models with LLMs (LinkNER) and an uncertainty-based linking strategy called RDC that enables fine-tuned models to complement black-box LLMs, achieving better performance. We experiment with both standard NER test sets and noisy social media datasets. LinkNER enhances NER task performance, notably surpassing SOTA models in robustness tests. We also quantitatively analyze the influence of key components like uncertainty estimation methods, LLMs, and in-context learning on diverse NER tasks, offering specific web-related recommendations.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce "CosmoAgent," an innovative artificial intelligence framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations, with a special emphasis on Stephen Hawking's cautionary advice about not sending radio signals haphazardly into the universe. The goal is to assess the feasibility of peaceful coexistence while considering potential risks that could threaten well-intentioned civilizations. Employing mathematical models and state transition matrices, our approach quantitatively evaluates the development trajectories of civilizations, offering insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among various civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLMs with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research provides a new way to understand complex inter-civilizational dynamics, expanding our perspective while pioneering novel strategies for conflict resolution, which are crucial for preventing interstellar conflicts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Kewei Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of large language models, applying techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation can better address Open-Domain Question-Answering problems. Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to covering longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder language model that effectively encodes contexts, and the encoding applies cross-attention with origin inputs. With our method, the origin language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that after fine-tuning, there is improved performance across two held-in datasets, four held-out datasets, and also in two In Context Learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Rosenthal, Avirup Sil, Radu Florian, Salim Roukos</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular application for large language models. It is preferable that successful RAG systems provide accurate answers that are supported by being grounded in a passage without any hallucinations. While considerable work is required for building a full RAG pipeline, being able to benchmark performance is also necessary. We present ClapNQ, a benchmark Long-form Question Answering dataset for the full RAG pipeline. ClapNQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The ClapNQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, meaning that the answer is composed fluently, often by integrating multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous. RAG models must adapt to these properties to be successful at ClapNQ. We present baseline experiments and analysis for ClapNQ that highlight areas where there is still significant room for improvement in grounded RAG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Franco-S\'anchez, Arnau Mart\'i-Llobet, Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho</p>
<p>Abstract: Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron J. Li, Satyapriya Krishna, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Abstract: A language model (LM) is a mapping from a linguistic context to an output token. However, much remains to be known about this mapping, including how its geometric properties relate to its function. We take a high-level geometric approach to its analysis, observing, across five pre-trained transformer-based LMs and three input datasets, a distinct phase characterized by high intrinsic dimensionality. During this phase, representations (1) correspond to the first full linguistic abstraction of the input; (2) are the first to viably transfer to downstream tasks; (3) predict each other across different LMs. Moreover, we find that an earlier onset of the phase strongly predicts better language modelling performance. In short, our results suggest that a central high-dimensionality phase underlies core linguistic processing in many common LM architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Weijieying Ren, Lu Jiang, Dongjie Wang, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) gain substantial reasoning and decision-making capabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of Thought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due to the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and inadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it challenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive logical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that considers both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step of the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT performs planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential reasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLM's ability to assess overall strategy. Through this combination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts and integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising branches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances the model's coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making, and thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable inferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of experiments on different types of tasks showcases that the RATT structure significantly outperforms existing methods in factual correctness and logical coherence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are increasingly being deployed across diverse industries and research domains. Developers and end-users interact with these systems through the use of prompting and prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence. We establish a structured understanding of prompt engineering by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their applications. We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs such as ChatGPT. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Fang, Dongzhe Fan, Sirui Ding, Ninghao Liu, Qiaoyu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are represented by textual descriptions, is crucial for textual and relational knowledge systems and recommendation systems. Currently, state-of-the-art embedding methods for TAGs primarily focus on fine-tuning language models (e.g., BERT) using structure-aware training signals. While effective, these methods are tailored for individual TAG and cannot generalize across various graph scenarios. Given the shared textual space, leveraging multiple TAGs for joint fine-tuning, aligning text and graph structure from different aspects, would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Unified Graph Language Model (UniGLM) framework, the first graph embedding model that generalizes well to both in-domain and cross-domain TAGs. Specifically, UniGLM is trained over multiple TAGs with different domains and scales using self-supervised contrastive learning. UniGLM includes an adaptive positive sample selection technique for identifying structurally similar nodes and a lazy contrastive module that is devised to accelerate training by minimizing repetitive encoding calculations. Extensive empirical results across 9 benchmark TAGs demonstrate UniGLM's efficacy against leading embedding baselines in terms of generalization (various downstream tasks and backbones) and transfer learning (in and out of domain scenarios).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arian Askari, Christian Poelitz, Xinye Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-correction in text-to-SQL is the process of prompting large language model (LLM) to revise its previously incorrectly generated SQL, and commonly relies on manually crafted self-correction guidelines by human experts that are not only labor-intensive to produce but also limited by the human ability in identifying all potential error patterns in LLM responses. We introduce MAGIC, a novel multi-agent method that automates the creation of the self-correction guideline. MAGIC uses three specialized agents: a manager, a correction, and a feedback agent. These agents collaborate on the failures of an LLM-based method on the training set to iteratively generate and refine a self-correction guideline tailored to LLM mistakes, mirroring human processes but without human involvement. Our extensive experiments show that MAGIC's guideline outperforms expert human's created ones. We empirically find out that the guideline produced by MAGIC enhances the interpretability of the corrections made, providing insights in analyzing the reason behind the failures and successes of LLMs in self-correction. All agent interactions are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MAGIC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Treutlein, Dami Choi, Jan Betley, Samuel Marks, Cem Anil, Roger Grosse, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to censor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the explicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various training documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing together these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we study inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in which LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a suite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further experiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs $(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses. While OOCR succeeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to "connect the dots" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Edge-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies are increasingly prevalent in the development of intelligent and personalized assistants. However, resource-constrained ASR models face significant challenges in adaptivity, incrementality, and inclusivity when faced with a diverse population. To tackle those challenges, we propose PI-Whisper, a novel ASR system that adaptively enhances recognition capabilities by identifying speakers' characteristics in real-time. In this work, we show how the design of PI-Whisper allows for incremental adaptation of new characteristics without the need for repetitive retraining, enhances recognition capabilities, and improves equity and fairness across diverse speaker groups. PI-Whisper demonstrates these advantages by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing the word error rate (WER) by up to 13.7% relative to baselines while scaling linearly to computing resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dancheng Liu, Amir Nassereldine, Ziming Yang, Chenhui Xu, Yuting Hu, Jiajie Li, Utkarsh Kumar, Changjae Lee, Ruiyang Qin, Yiyu Shi, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their exceptional abilities in various natural language processing tasks, but they suffer from hallucinations that will cause performance degradation. One promising solution to improve the LLMs' performance is to ask LLMs to revise their answer after generation, a technique known as self-correction. Among the two types of self-correction, intrinsic self-correction is considered a promising direction because it does not utilize external knowledge. However, recent works doubt the validity of LLM's ability to conduct intrinsic self-correction. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the intrinsic self-correction capabilities of LLMs through theoretical analyses and empirical experiments. In addition, we identify two critical factors for successful self-correction: zero temperature and fair prompts. Leveraging these factors, we demonstrate that intrinsic self-correction ability is exhibited across multiple existing LLMs. Our findings offer insights into the fundamental theories underlying the self-correction behavior of LLMs and remark on the importance of unbiased prompts and zero temperature settings in harnessing their full potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show superior performance in various tasks. Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their lack of controllability remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this challenge, we propose Planning-based Conversational Agents (PCA), a novel dialogue framework aimed at enhancing the controllability of LLM-driven agents. Specifically, our approach introduces Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow. To enable PCA to learn SOP, we curate a dataset comprising SOP-annotated multi-scenario dialogues, generated using a semi-automated role-playing system with GPT-4o and validated through strict manual quality control. Additionally, we propose a novel method that integrates Chain of Thought reasoning with supervised fine-tuning for SOP prediction and utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal action planning during dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, such as achieving a 27.95% improvement in action accuracy compared to baseline models based on GPT-3.5 and also showing notable gains for open-source models. Dataset and codes are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxu Zhu, Jinlin Xiao, Yuhang Wang, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to being misled by false premise questions (FPQs), leading to errors in factual knowledge, know as factuality hallucination. Existing benchmarks that assess this vulnerability primarily rely on manual construction, resulting in limited scale and lack of scalability. In this work, we introduce an automated, scalable pipeline to create FPQs based on knowledge graphs (KGs). The first step is modifying true triplets extracted from KGs to create false premises. Subsequently, utilizing the state-of-the-art capabilities of GPTs, we generate semantically rich FPQs. Based on the proposed method, we present a comprehensive benchmark, the Knowledge Graph-based False Premise Questions (KG-FPQ), which contains approximately 178k FPQs across three knowledge domains, at six levels of confusability, and in two task formats. Using KG-FPQ, we conduct extensive evaluations on several representative LLMs and provide valuable insights. The KG-FPQ dataset and code are available at~https://github.com/yanxuzhu/KG-FPQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Tong, Xiwen Zhang, Rui Wang, Ruidong Wu, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving mathematical problems requires advanced reasoning abilities and presents notable challenges for large language models. Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries. Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we propose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4. We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called DART-MATH. In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, DART-MATH outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hukai Huang, Shenghui Lu, Yahui Shan, He Qu, Fengrun Zhang, Wenhao Guan, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model is a promising approach for handling code-switching speech recognition (CS-ASR) tasks. However, the existing CS-ASR work on MoE has yet to leverage the advantages of MoE's parameter scaling ability fully. This work proposes DLG-MoE, a Dynamic Language Group-based MoE, which can effectively handle the CS-ASR task and leverage the advantages of parameter scaling. DLG-MoE operates based on a hierarchical routing mechanism. First, the language router explicitly models the language attribute and dispatches the representations to the corresponding language expert groups. Subsequently, the unsupervised router within each language group implicitly models attributes beyond language and coordinates expert routing and collaboration. DLG-MoE outperforms the existing MoE methods on CS-ASR tasks while demonstrating great flexibility. It supports different top-$k$ inference and streaming capabilities and can also prune the model parameters flexibly to obtain a monolingual sub-model. The code has been released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Wu, Ziwei Gong, Lin Ai, Pengyuan Shi, Kaan Donbekci, Julia Hirschberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in speech is a challenging multimodal task that requires understanding both verbal content and vocal nuances. This paper introduces a novel approach to emotion detection using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding. To overcome the inherent limitation of LLMs in processing audio inputs, we propose SpeechCueLLM, a method that translates speech characteristics into natural language descriptions, allowing LLMs to perform multimodal emotion analysis via text prompts without any architectural changes. Our method is minimal yet impactful, outperforming baseline models that require structural modifications. We evaluate SpeechCueLLM on two datasets: IEMOCAP and MELD, showing significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy, particularly for high-quality audio data. We also explore the effectiveness of various feature representations and fine-tuning strategies for different LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating speech descriptions yields a more than 2% increase in the average weighted F1 score on IEMOCAP (from 70.111% to 72.596%).</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capability and influence, ensuring their security and preventing harmful outputs has become crucial. A promising approach to address these concerns involves training models to automatically generate adversarial prompts for red teaming. However, the evolving subtlety of vulnerabilities in LLMs challenges the effectiveness of current adversarial methods, which struggle to specifically target and explore the weaknesses of these models. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the $\mathbf{S}\text{elf-}\mathbf{E}\text{volving }\mathbf{A}\text{dversarial }\mathbf{S}\text{afety }\mathbf{(SEAS)}$ optimization framework, which enhances security by leveraging data generated by the model itself. SEAS operates through three iterative stages: Initialization, Attack, and Adversarial Optimization, refining both the Red Team and Target models to improve robustness and safety. This framework reduces reliance on manual testing and significantly enhances the security capabilities of LLMs. Our contributions include a novel adversarial framework, a comprehensive safety dataset, and after three iterations, the Target model achieves a security level comparable to GPT-4, while the Red Team model shows a marked increase in attack success rate (ASR) against advanced models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Li, Yike Zhang, Tengyu Pan, Yutao Sun, Zhichao Duan, Junjie Fang, Rong Han, Zixuan Wang, Jianyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Empowering LLMs with the ability to precisely understand long contexts is crucial for many downstream applications. However, handling long contexts with conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. Existing context condensing methods cannot accurately understand the full context, as there is a considerable amount of information loss in the condensing process. To address these issues, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the fixed context length of any decoder-only LLM, allowing the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM first divides long text input into chunks based on the model's original context length. It then employs the dynamic condensing process to distill crucial information from each chunk. Ultimately, through the novel parallel decoding mechanism, FocusLLM can integrate the extracted information into its local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length and with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

<p>Abstract: Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain as black-box systems. Understanding the reasoning bottlenecks of LLMs has become a critical challenge, as these limitations are deeply tied to their internal architecture. Among these, attention heads have emerged as a focal point for investigating the underlying mechanics of LLMs. In this survey, we aim to demystify the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by systematically exploring the roles and mechanisms of attention heads. We first introduce a novel four-stage framework inspired by the human thought process: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation. Using this framework, we comprehensively review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads. Additionally, we analyze the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free and Modeling-Required methods. We further summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honggen Zhang, Xufeng Zhao, Igor Molybog, June Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human feedback. The response pair annotation process is the most labor-intensive and costly part of the alignment pipeline, and improving its efficiency and annotation quality would have a meaningful impact on AI development. We propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the most informative response pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on embedding responses independently of prompts. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned on dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error to improve the efficiency of LLM alignment, saving up to 65% of annotators' work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler A. Chang, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Tolga Bolukbasi, Lucas Dixon, Ian Tenney</p>
<p>Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to attribute model outputs back to specific training examples, and the application of these methods to large language model (LLM) outputs could significantly advance model transparency and data curation. However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods to the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing gradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve influential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining corpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our method combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a task-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to be critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact tracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence model predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25 still perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant facts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution* and causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find that influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we examine different types of examples identified as influential by our method, finding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the same output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and names. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based visualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an 8B-parameter LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyuan Shi, Zexin Lu, Xiaoyu Dong, Wenlong Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yujie Feng, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) through fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Therefore, understanding what LLMs learn during the alignment process is crucial. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To delve deeper into LLM alignment, we propose to identify which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process, thereby uncovering how alignment influences model behavior at a granular level. We propose a novel approach to identify the important layers for LLM alignment (ILA). It involves learning a binary mask for each incremental weight matrix in the LoRA algorithm, indicating the significance of each layer. ILA consistently identifies important layers across various alignment datasets, with nearly 90% overlap even with substantial dataset differences, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. Experimental results indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. The implemented framework is denoted as \textbf{STILL-1}. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain specific question answering is an evolving field that requires specialized solutions to address unique challenges. In this paper, we show that a hybrid approach combining a fine-tuned dense retriever with keyword based sparse search methods significantly enhances performance. Our system leverages a linear combination of relevance signals, including cosine similarity from dense retrieval, BM25 scores, and URL host matching, each with tunable boost parameters. Experimental results indicate that this hybrid method outperforms our single-retriever system, achieving improved accuracy while maintaining robust contextual grounding. These findings suggest that integrating multiple retrieval methodologies with weighted scoring effectively addresses the complexities of domain specific question answering in enterprise settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Chen, Xiaoye Zhu, Tianyang Liu, Ying Chen, Xinhui Chen, Yiwen Yuan, Chak Tou Leong, Zuchao Li, Tang Long, Lei Zhang, Chenyu Yan, Guanghao Mei, Jie Zhang, Lefei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, making detecting machine-generated text increasingly challenging. Although past methods have achieved good performance on detecting pure machine-generated text, those detectors have poor performance on distinguishing machine-revised text (rewriting, expansion, and polishing), which can have only minor changes from its original human prompt. As the content of text may originate from human prompts, detecting machine-revised text often involves identifying distinctive machine styles, e.g., worded favored by LLMs. However, existing methods struggle to detect machine-style phrasing hidden within the content contributed by humans. We propose the "Imitate Before Detect" (ImBD) approach, which first imitates the machine-style token distribution, and then compares the distribution of the text to be tested with the machine-style distribution to determine whether the text has been machine-revised. To this end, we introduce style preference optimization (SPO), which aligns a scoring LLM model to the preference of text styles generated by machines. The aligned scoring model is then used to calculate the style-conditional probability curvature (Style-CPC), quantifying the log probability difference between the original and conditionally sampled texts for effective detection. We conduct extensive comparisons across various scenarios, encompassing text revisions by six LLMs, four distinct text domains, and three machine revision types. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our method yields a 13% increase in AUC for detecting text revised by open-source LLMs, and improves performance by 5% and 19% for detecting GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o revised text, respectively. Notably, our method surpasses the commercially trained GPT-Zero with just $1,000$ samples and five minutes of SPO, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Chris Hinze, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works as a backbone for interacting with an enterprise's own data via Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA). In a RAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a question, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM) for generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems today suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain their raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both retrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain answer generation typically rely only on similarity between the answer and the retrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal explanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies the above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and surrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal explanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is determined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by removing that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark ConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in English and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and answers from 215 public Confluence pages. These documents are typical of enterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE on ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves RAG performance, and counterfactual explanations outperform standard attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hangeul was created as a phonetic alphabet and is known to have the best 1:1 correspondence between letters and pronunciation among existing alphabets. In this paper, we examine the possibility of modifying the basic form of Hangeul and using it as a kind of phonetic symbol. The core concept of this approach is to preserve the basic form of the alphabet, modifying only the shape of a stroke rather than the letter itself. To the best of our knowledge, no previous attempts in any language have been made to express pronunciations of an alphabet different from the original simply by changing the shape of the alphabet strokes, and this paper is probably the first attempt in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minlie Huang, Yingkang Wang, Shiyao Cui, Pei Ke, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: We have witnessed superhuman intelligence thanks to the fast development of large language models and multimodal language models. As the application of such superhuman models becomes more and more popular, a critical question arises here: how can we ensure superhuman models are still safe, reliable and aligned well to human values? In this position paper, we discuss the concept of superalignment from the learning perspective to answer this question by outlining the learning paradigm shift from large-scale pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, to alignment training. We define superalignment as designing effective and efficient alignment algorithms to learn from noisy-labeled data (point-wise samples or pair-wise preference data) in a scalable way when the task becomes very complex for human experts to annotate and the model is stronger than human experts. We highlight some key research problems in superalignment, namely, weak-to-strong generalization, scalable oversight, and evaluation. We then present a conceptual framework for superalignment, which consists of three modules: an attacker which generates adversary queries trying to expose the weaknesses of a learner model; a learner which will refine itself by learning from scalable feedbacks generated by a critic model along with minimal human experts; and a critic which generates critics or explanations for a given query-response pair, with a target of improving the learner by criticizing. We discuss some important research problems in each component of this framework and highlight some interesting research ideas that are closely related to our proposed framework, for instance, self-alignment, self-play, self-refinement, and more. Last, we highlight some future research directions for superalignment, including identification of new emergent risks and multi-dimensional alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshan Deshpande, Selvan Sunitha Ravi, Sky CH-Wang, Bartosz Mielczarek, Anand Kannappan, Rebecca Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: The LLM-as-judge paradigm is increasingly being adopted for automated evaluation of model outputs. While LLM judges have shown promise on constrained evaluation tasks, closed source LLMs display critical shortcomings when deployed in real world applications due to challenges of fine grained metrics and explainability, while task specific evaluation models lack cross-domain generalization. We introduce GLIDER, a powerful 3B evaluator LLM that can score any text input and associated context on arbitrary user defined criteria. GLIDER shows higher Pearson's correlation than GPT-4o on FLASK and greatly outperforms prior evaluation models, achieving comparable performance to LLMs 17x its size. GLIDER supports fine-grained scoring, multilingual reasoning, span highlighting and was trained on 685 domains and 183 criteria. Extensive qualitative analysis shows that GLIDER scores are highly correlated with human judgments, with 91.3% human agreement. We have open-sourced GLIDER to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lulu Zhao, Weihao Zeng, Xiaofeng Shi, Hua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, both closed-source LLMs and open-source communities have made significant strides, outperforming humans in various general domains. However, their performance in specific professional domains such as medicine, especially within the open-source community, remains suboptimal due to the complexity of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose CareBot, a bilingual medical LLM, which leverages a comprehensive approach integrating continuous pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Our novel two-stage CPT method, comprising Stable CPT and Boost CPT, effectively bridges the gap between general and domain-specific data, facilitating a smooth transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and enhancing domain knowledge progressively. We also introduce DataRater, a model designed to assess data quality during CPT, ensuring that the training data is both accurate and relevant. For SFT, we develope a large and diverse bilingual dataset, along with ConFilter, a metric to enhance multi-turn dialogue quality, which is crucial to improving the model's ability to handle more complex dialogues. The combination of high-quality data sources and innovative techniques significantly improves CareBot's performance across a range of medical applications. Our rigorous evaluations on Chinese and English benchmarks confirm CareBot's effectiveness in medical consultation and education. These advancements not only address current limitations in medical LLMs but also set a new standard for developing effective and reliable open-source models in the medical domain. We will open-source the datasets and models later, contributing valuable resources to the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reagan J. Lee, Samarth Goel, Kannan Ramchandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models are crucial for tasks in Information Retrieval (IR) and semantic similarity measurement, yet their handling of longer texts and associated positional biases remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, irrespective of their positional encoding mechanisms, disproportionately prioritize the beginning of an input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3\% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity. We hypothesize that this effect arises from pre-processing strategies and chosen positional encoding techniques. These findings quantify the sensitivity of retrieval systems and suggest a new lens towards embedding model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant safety concerns have emerged. Fundamentally, the safety of large language models is closely linked to the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and clarity of their understanding of safety knowledge, particularly in domains such as law, policy and ethics. This factuality ability is crucial in determining whether these models can be deployed and applied safely and compliantly within specific regions. To address these challenges and better evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short questions, we introduce the Chinese SafetyQA benchmark. Chinese SafetyQA has several properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate, Safety-related, Harmless). Based on Chinese SafetyQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing LLMs and analyze how these capabilities relate to LLM abilities, e.g., RAG ability and robustness against attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmin Lee, Woo-Jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Ahuja, Amin Mansouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of sequence-to-sequence models can be studied from the lens of two crucial forms of generalization: length generalization -- the ability to generalize to longer sequences than ones seen during training, and compositional generalization: the ability to generalize to token combinations not seen during training. In this work, we provide first provable guarantees on length and compositional generalization for common sequence-to-sequence models -- deep sets, transformers, state space models, and recurrent neural nets -- trained to minimize the prediction error. We show that limited capacity versions of these different architectures achieve both length and compositional generalization provided the training distribution is sufficiently diverse. In the first part, we study structured limited capacity variants of different architectures and arrive at the generalization guarantees with limited diversity requirements on the training distribution. In the second part, we study limited capacity variants with less structural assumptions and arrive at generalization guarantees but with more diversity requirements on the training distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Regression is a powerful tool to accurately predict the outcome metric of a system given a set of parameters, but has traditionally been restricted to methods which are only applicable to a specific task. In this paper, we propose OmniPred, a framework for training language models as universal end-to-end regressors over $(x,y)$ data from arbitrary formats. Using data sourced from Google Vizier, one of the largest proprietary blackbox optimization databases in the world, our extensive experiments demonstrate that language models are capable of very precise numerical regression using only textual representations of mathematical parameters and values, and if given the opportunity to train at scale over multiple tasks, can significantly outperform traditional regression models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Liu, Xiuying Chen, Xiaoqing Zhang, Xing Gao, Ji Zhang, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital era, the rapid propagation of fake news and rumors via social networks brings notable societal challenges and impacts public opinion regulation. Traditional fake news modeling typically forecasts the general popularity trends of different groups or numerically represents opinions shift. However, these methods often oversimplify real-world complexities and overlook the rich semantic information of news text. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides the possibility of modeling subtle dynamics of opinion. Consequently, in this work, we introduce a Fake news Propagation Simulation framework (FPS) based on LLM, which studies the trends and control of fake news propagation in detail. Specifically, each agent in the simulation represents an individual with a distinct personality. They are equipped with both short-term and long-term memory, as well as a reflective mechanism to mimic human-like thinking. Every day, they engage in random opinion exchanges, reflect on their thinking, and update their opinions. Our simulation results uncover patterns in fake news propagation related to topic relevance, and individual traits, aligning with real-world observations. Additionally, we evaluate various intervention strategies and demonstrate that early and appropriately frequent interventions strike a balance between governance cost and effectiveness, offering valuable insights for practical applications. Our study underscores the significant utility and potential of LLMs in combating fake news.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejas Kasetty, Divyat Mahajan, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Alexandre Drouin, Dhanya Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system. As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial. A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions. Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention. We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning. These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts. We evaluate six LLMs on the benchmarks, finding that GPT models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Feng, Jun Zhang, Tianhui Liu, Xin Zhang, Tianjian Ouyang, Junbo Yan, Yuwei Du, Siqi Guo, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) with extensive general knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities have seen rapid development and widespread application. A systematic and reliable evaluation of LLMs or vision-language model (VLMs) is a crucial step in applying and developing them for various fields. There have been some early explorations about the usability of LLMs for limited urban tasks, but a systematic and scalable evaluation benchmark is still lacking. The challenge in constructing a systematic evaluation benchmark for urban research lies in the diversity of urban data, the complexity of application scenarios and the highly dynamic nature of the urban environment. In this paper, we design CityBench, an interactive simulator based evaluation platform, as the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks in urban research. First, we build CityData to integrate the diverse urban data and CitySimu to simulate fine-grained urban dynamics. Based on CityData and CitySimu, we design 8 representative urban tasks in 2 categories of perception-understanding and decision-making as the CityBench. With extensive results from 30 well-known LLMs and VLMs in 13 cities around the world, we find that advanced LLMs and VLMs can achieve competitive performance in diverse urban tasks requiring commonsense and semantic understanding abilities, e.g., understanding the human dynamics and semantic inference of urban images. Meanwhile, they fail to solve the challenging urban tasks requiring professional knowledge and high-level reasoning abilities, e.g., geospatial prediction and traffic control task. These observations provide valuable perspectives for utilizing and developing LLMs in the future. Codes are openly accessible via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JiaYing Zheng, HaiNan Zhang, LingXiang Wang, WangJie Qiu, HongWei Zheng, ZhiMing Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Private data, being larger and quality-higher than public data, can greatly improve large language models (LLM). However, due to privacy concerns, this data is often dispersed in multiple silos, making its secure utilization for LLM training a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is an ideal solution for training models with distributed private data, but traditional frameworks like FedAvg are unsuitable for LLM due to their high computational demands on clients. An alternative, split learning, offloads most training parameters to the server while training embedding and output layers locally, making it more suitable for LLM. Nonetheless, it faces significant challenges in security and efficiency. Firstly, the gradients of embeddings are prone to attacks, leading to potential reverse engineering of private data. Furthermore, the server's limitation of handle only one client's training request at a time hinders parallel training, severely impacting training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Federated Learning framework for LLM, named FL-GLM, which prevents data leakage caused by both server-side and peer-client attacks while improving training efficiency. Specifically, we first place the input block and output block on local client to prevent embedding gradient attacks from server. Secondly, we employ key-encryption during client-server communication to prevent reverse engineering attacks from peer-clients. Lastly, we employ optimization methods like client-batching or server-hierarchical, adopting different acceleration methods based on the actual computational capabilities of the server. Experimental results on NLU and generation tasks demonstrate that FL-GLM achieves comparable metrics to centralized chatGLM model, validating the effectiveness of our federated learning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojian Jiang, Yi Jing, Tianhao Shen, Tong Wu, Qing Yang, Deyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is paramount, yet identifying potential vulnerabilities is challenging. While manual red teaming is effective, it is time-consuming, costly and lacks scalability. Automated red teaming (ART) offers a more cost-effective alternative, automatically generating adversarial prompts to expose LLM vulnerabilities. However, in current ART efforts, a robust framework is absent, which explicitly frames red teaming as an effectively learnable task. To address this gap, we propose Automated Progressive Red Teaming (APRT) as an effectively learnable framework. APRT leverages three core modules: an Intention Expanding LLM that generates diverse initial attack samples, an Intention Hiding LLM that crafts deceptive prompts, and an Evil Maker to manage prompt diversity and filter ineffective samples. The three modules collectively and progressively explore and exploit LLM vulnerabilities through multi-round interactions. In addition to the framework, we further propose a novel indicator, Attack Effectiveness Rate (AER) to mitigate the limitations of existing evaluation metrics. By measuring the likelihood of eliciting unsafe but seemingly helpful responses, AER aligns closely with human evaluations. Extensive experiments with both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrate the effectiveness of ARPT across both open- and closed-source LLMs. Specifically, APRT effectively elicits 54% unsafe yet useful responses from Meta's Llama-3-8B-Instruct, 50% from GPT-4o (API access), and 39% from Claude-3.5 (API access), showcasing its robust attack capability and transferability across LLMs (especially from open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murdock Aubry, Haoming Meng, Anton Sugolov, Vardan Papyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we trace the trajectories of individual tokens as they pass through transformer blocks, and linearize the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these Jacobians, we uncover a $\textbf{transformer block coupling}$ phenomenon in a variety of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling $\textit{positively correlates}$ with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters, namely parameter budget, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate the emergence of these properties through training, noting the development of coupling, as well as an increase in linearity and layer-wise exponential growth in the token trajectories. These collective insights provide a novel perspective on the interactions between token embeddings, and prompt further approaches to study training and generalization in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitian Gao, Yihao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojun Shi, Suyu Ye, Xinyu Fang, Chuanyang Jin, Leyla Isik, Yen-Ling Kuo, Tianmin Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Canby, Adam Davies, Chirag Rastogi, Julia Hockenmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we formally define and quantify two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons of the reliability of different families of causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear or counterfactual vs. nullifying interventions). We find that: (1) there is an inherent tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) no leading probing method is able to consistently satisfy both criteria at once; (3) methods with more favorable tradeoffs have a more consistent impact on LLM behavior; and (4) nullifying interventions are far less complete than counterfactual interventions, suggesting that nullifying methods may not be an effective approach to causal probing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qidong Liu, Xian Wu, Wanyu Wang, Yejing Wang, Yuanshao Zhu, Xiangyu Zhao, Feng Tian, Yefeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS), which model a user's interaction history to predict the next item of interest, are widely used in various applications. However, existing SRS often struggle with low-popularity items, a challenge known as the long-tail problem. This issue leads to reduced serendipity for users and diminished profits for sellers, ultimately harming the overall system. Large Language Model (LLM) has the ability to capture semantic relationships between items, independent of their popularity, making it a promising solution to this problem. In this paper, we introduce LLMEmb, a novel method leveraging LLM to generate item embeddings that enhance SRS performance. To bridge the gap between general-purpose LLM and the recommendation domain, we propose a Supervised Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCFT) approach. This approach includes attribute-level data augmentation and a tailored contrastive loss to make LLM more recommendation-friendly. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating collaborative signals into LLM-generated embeddings, for which we propose Recommendation Adaptation Training (RAT). This further refines the embeddings for optimal use in SRS. The LLMEmb-derived embeddings can be seamlessly integrated with any SRS models, underscoring the practical value. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMEmb significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple SRS models. The code for our method is released online https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/LLMEmb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Zhou, Jiangtao Yan, Shibo He, Wenchao Meng, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot (ZS) 3D anomaly detection is a crucial yet unexplored field that addresses scenarios where target 3D training samples are unavailable due to practical concerns like privacy protection. This paper introduces PointAD, a novel approach that transfers the strong generalization capabilities of CLIP for recognizing 3D anomalies on unseen objects. PointAD provides a unified framework to comprehend 3D anomalies from both points and pixels. In this framework, PointAD renders 3D anomalies into multiple 2D renderings and projects them back into 3D space. To capture the generic anomaly semantics into PointAD, we propose hybrid representation learning that optimizes the learnable text prompts from 3D and 2D through auxiliary point clouds. The collaboration optimization between point and pixel representations jointly facilitates our model to grasp underlying 3D anomaly patterns, contributing to detecting and segmenting anomalies of unseen diverse 3D objects. Through the alignment of 3D and 2D space, our model can directly integrate RGB information, further enhancing the understanding of 3D anomalies in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show the superiority of PointAD in ZS 3D anomaly detection across diverse unseen objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Liu, Yang Li, Jiang Li, Shan Yang, Yunshi Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in zero-shot Relation Extraction (RE) has focused on using Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their impressive zero-shot capabilities. However, current methods often perform suboptimally, mainly due to a lack of detailed, context-specific prompts needed for understanding various sentences and relations. To address this, we introduce the Self-Prompting framework, a novel method designed to fully harness the embedded RE knowledge within LLMs. Specifically, our framework employs a three-stage diversity approach to prompt LLMs, generating multiple synthetic samples that encapsulate specific relations from scratch. These generated samples act as in-context learning samples, offering explicit and context-specific guidance to efficiently prompt LLMs for RE. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show our approach outperforms existing LLM-based zero-shot RE methods. Additionally, our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our generation pipeline in producing high-quality synthetic data that enhances performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqi Duan, Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Hicks, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student's code submission passes each test case and 2) the student's open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for enhancing privacy and security in deep learning models, particularly in large multimodal language models (MLLMs), by removing specific private or hazardous information. While MU has made significant progress in textual and visual modalities, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains significantly underexplored, partially due to the absence of a suitable open-source benchmark. To address this, we introduce CLEAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate MMU methods. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We assess 10 MU methods, adapting them for MMU, and highlight new challenges specific to multimodal forgetting. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/therem/CLEAR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Koh, Jang Han Yoon, MinHyung Lee, Youngjin Song, Jaegwan Cho, Jaehyun Kang, Taehyeon Kim, Se-young Yun, Youngjae Yu, Bongshin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. $\langle \text{instruction}, \text{data}, \text{code} \rangle$ triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, C$^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). The results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperform nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, a study of LLM users revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at chartsquared.github.io, with ample qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anup Singh, Kris Demuynck, Vipul Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Spoken term detection (STD) is often hindered by reliance on frame-level features and the computationally intensive DTW-based template matching, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that encodes speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens. This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms. Our approach focuses on generating consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term. We also propose a bidirectional state space modeling within the Mamba encoder, trained in a self-supervised learning framework, to learn contextual frame-level features that are further encoded into discrete tokens. Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks. Empirical evaluation on LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases indicates that our method outperforms existing STD baselines while being more efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks. These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions. These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an ``imitate, explore, and self-improve'' framework, denoted as \textbf{STILL-2}, as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems on these benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Luo, Linghang Shi, Yihao Li, Aobo Zhuang, Yeyun Gong, Ling Liu, Chen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reliably avoids harmful behaviors is a critical challenge, especially for systems with high autonomy or in safety-critical domains. Despite various safety assurance proposals and extreme risk warnings, comprehensive guidelines balancing AI safety and capability remain lacking. In this position paper, we propose the \textit{AI-\textbf{$45^{\circ}$} Law} as a guiding principle for a balanced roadmap toward trustworthy AGI, and introduce the \textit{Causal Ladder of Trustworthy AGI} as a practical framework. This framework provides a systematic taxonomy and hierarchical structure for current AI capability and safety research, inspired by Judea Pearl's ``Ladder of Causation''. The Causal Ladder comprises three core layers: the Approximate Alignment Layer, the Intervenable Layer, and the Reflectable Layer. These layers address the key challenges of safety and trustworthiness in AGI and contemporary AI systems. Building upon this framework, we define five levels of trustworthy AGI: perception, reasoning, decision-making, autonomy, and collaboration trustworthiness. These levels represent distinct yet progressive aspects of trustworthy AGI. Finally, we present a series of potential governance measures to support the development of trustworthy AGI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mobile sensing application - life journaling - designed to generate semantic descriptions of users' daily lives. We present AutoLife, an automatic life journaling system based on commercial smartphones. AutoLife only inputs low-cost sensor data (without photos or audio) from smartphones and can automatically generate comprehensive life journals for users. To achieve this, we first derive time, motion, and location contexts from multimodal sensor data, and harness the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enriched with commonsense knowledge about human lives, to interpret diverse contexts and generate life journals. To manage the task complexity and long sensing duration, a multilayer framework is proposed, which decomposes tasks and seamlessly integrates LLMs with other techniques for life journaling. This study establishes a real-life dataset as a benchmark and extensive experiment results demonstrate that AutoLife produces accurate and reliable life journals.</p>
