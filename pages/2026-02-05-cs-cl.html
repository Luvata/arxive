<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elgaar, Hadi Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Saule, Kalpathi Subramanian, Razvan Bunescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Professional societies often publish curriculum guidelines to help programs align their content to international standards. In Computer Science, the primary standard is published by ACM and IEEE and provide detailed guidelines for what should be and could be included in a Computer Science program.
  While very helpful, it remains difficult for program administrators to assess how much of the guidelines is being covered by a CS program. This is in particular due to the extensiveness of the guidelines, containing thousands of individual items. As such, it is time consuming and cognitively demanding to audit every course to confidently mark everything that is actually being covered. Our preliminary work indicated that it takes about a day of work per course.
  In this work, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques to accelerate the process. We explore two kinds of techniques, the first relying on traditional tools for parsing, tagging, and embeddings, while the second leverages the power of Large Language Models. We evaluate the application of these techniques to classify a corpus of pedagogical materials and show that we can meaningfully classify documents automatically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Kwiatkowski, Natasha Butt, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vsevolod Kapatsinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04033">On the Credibility of Evaluating LLMs using Survey Questions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jind\v{r}ich Libovick\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04081">Abstraction Induces the Brain Alignment of Language and Speech Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Cheng, Aditya R. Vaidya, Richard Antonello</p>
<p>Abstract: Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models and speech audio models predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04105">Expert Selections In MoE Models Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Nuriyev, Gabriel Kulp</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangnan Yang, Junjie Chen, Fei Wang, Yiqi Nie, Yuxin Liu, Zhangling Duan, Jie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychological counseling is a fundamentally multimodal cognitive process in which clinicians integrate verbal content with visual and vocal cues to infer clients' mental states and respond empathically. However, most existing language-model-based counseling systems operate on text alone and rely on implicit mental state inference. We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sercan Karaka\c{s}, Yusuf \c{S}im\c{s}ek</p>
<p>Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexin Zhang, Yida Lu, Junfeng Fang, Junxiao Yang, Shiyao Cui, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04197">From Helpfulness to Toxic Proactivity: Diagnosing Behavioral Misalignment in LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Wang, Yuanhe Zhang, Zhengshuo Gong, Haoran Gao, Fanyu Meng, Zhenhong Zhou, Li Sun, Yang Liu, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsien-Jyh Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic fluency but struggle to reliably complete long-horizon tasks under explicit procedural constraints. In legal cross-examination, purely proba-bilistic generation often maintains behavioral coherence while failing to ensure procedural advancement. We characterize this failure as procedural stagnation and propose Soft-FSM, a neuro-symbolic architecture that enforces monotonic progress over accumulated Key Information Units (KIUs) via an external deterministic state controller. Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy. These results suggest that, in such domains, reliable task completion cannot be guaranteed by emergent LLM behavior alone, and can be reliably enforced through explicit and verifiable external state control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael A. Lepori, Tal Linzen, Ann Yuan, Katja Filippova</p>
<p>Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuo Xu, Ahrii Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangwei Zhu, Zhifang Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.</p>

To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Cheng, Xingyu Zhu, Haoyu Zhao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Zheng, Xinyu Li, Qian Liu, Xiachong Feng, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhuang Sun, Ruitong Liu, Yuxia Zhu, Xiaohan Xu, Jingxuan Wei, Xiangxiang Zhang, Bihui Yu, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Wang, Shuaishuai Yang, Jingjing He, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04297">Revisiting Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models for Text Classification: The Role of Prompt Underspecification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Michal Spiegel, Robert Belanec, Jan Cegin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kahee Lim, Soyeon Kim, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichu Liang, Hongyu Zhu, Wenwen Wang, Deyu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Deng, Hanshuang Tong, Jun Li, Shining Liang, Ning Wu, Hongzhi Li, Yutao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isabel Tsintsiper, Sheng Wong, Beth Albert, Shaun P Brennecke, Gabriel Davis Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04398">Bi-directional Bias Attribution: Debiasing Large Language Models without Modifying Prompts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Lin, Kunquan Li, Yixuan Liao, Xiaoxin Chen, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Xinchen Li, Jialei Zhou, Hongnan Ma, Zhongwei Wan, Yiwei Shi, Duoqian Miao, Qi Zhang, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglong Yang, Zhilin Peng, Zhanzhan Liu, Haochen Shi, Sheng-Jun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Feng, Tianjiao Li, Zixiao Zhu, Hanzhang Zhou, Junlang Qian, Li Zhang, Jia Jim Deryl Chua, Lee Onn Mak, Gee Wah Ng, Kezhi Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaya Tsunokake, Yuta Koreeda, Terufumi Morishita, Koichi Nagatsuka, Hikaru Tomonari, Yasuhiro Sogawa</p>
<p>Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Ma, Yu Zhang, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yuwei Wang, Zeming Liu, Jun Yu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.</p>

We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Afzoon, MohammadHossein Ahmadi, Usman Naseem, Amin Beheshti</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeontaek Hwang, Nguyen Dinh Son, Daeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.</p>

Although these models perform well on LSC benchmarks, their results are often difficult to interpret. We explore an alternative approach that relies solely on frame semantics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kasliwal, Pratinav Seth, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-{\Delta}{\theta}: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update {\Delta}{\theta}C supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying {\Delta}{\theta}C yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Lin, Dongfang Li, Zhuoen Chen, Yukun Shi, Xuhui Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliezer Shlomi, Ido Levy, Eilam Shapira, Michael Katz, Guy Uziel, Segev Shlomov, Nir Mashkif, Roi Reichart, Sarah Keren</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04570">Can LLMs capture stable human-generated sentence entropy measures?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Estrella Pivel-Villanueva, Elisabeth Frederike Sterner, Franziska Knolle</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Phillips, Sean Wu, Boyan Gao, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.</p>

For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04604">Beyond Holistic Scores: Automatic Trait-Based Quality Scoring of Argumentative Essays</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucile Favero, Juan Antonio P\'erez-Ortiz, Tanja K\"aser, Nuria Oliver</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Bajaj, Anuj Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixiao Yang, Yuanhe Tian, Xu Yang, Huiqi Li, Yan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhang, Thales Bertaglia</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yike Sun, Haotong Yang, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei-Yueh Chen, Lateef Adeleke, C. M. Downey</p>
<p>Abstract: Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04729">&quot;Be My Cheese?&quot;: Cultural Nuance Benchmarking for Machine Translation in Multilingual LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Madison Van Doren, Casey Ford, Jennifer Barajas, Cory Holland</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameh Khattab, Jean-Philippe Corbeil, Osman Alperen Kora\c{s}, Amin Dada, Julian Friedrich, Fran\c{c}ois Beaulieu, Paul Vozila, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04739">Alignment Drift in Multimodal LLMs: A Two-Phase, Longitudinal Evaluation of Harm Across Eight Model Releases</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Casey Ford, Madison Van Doren, Emily Dix</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04750">Exploiting contextual information to improve stance detection in informal political discourse with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arman Engin Sucu, Yixiang Zhou, Mario A. Nascimento, Tony Mullen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04755">When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhou, Chang Jin, Carsten Eickhoff, Zhijiang Guo, Seyed Ali Bahrainian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04764">Beyond Many-Shot Translation: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations For Low-Resource Machine Translation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Frentzen Salim, Esteban Carlin, Alexandre Morinvil, Xi Ai, Lun-Wei Ku</p>
<p>Abstract: Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Yuan, Tailin Jin, Weize Chen, Zeyuan Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Madhwal, Lyuxin David Zhang, Dan Roth, Tomer Wolfson, Vivek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Tong, Chunlin Gong, Yiping Zhang, Qiang Liu, Xingcheng Xu, Shu Wu, Haichao Shi, Xiao-Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangzheng Li, Jianmo Ni, Chen Qu, Ian Miao, Liu Yang, Xingyu Fu, Muhao Chen, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p>

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandrashekar M S, Vineet Singh, Lakshmi Pedapudi</p>
<p>Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joel Wester, Samuel Rhys Cox, Henning Pohl, Niels van Berkel</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite growing recognition that responsible AI requires domain knowledge, current work on conversational AI primarily draws on clinical expertise that prioritises diagnosis and intervention. However, much of everyday emotional support needs occur in non-clinical contexts, and therefore requires different conversational approaches. We examine how chaplains, who guide individuals through personal crises, grief, and reflection, perceive and engage with conversational AI. We recruited eighteen chaplains to build AI chatbots. While some chaplains viewed chatbots with cautious optimism, the majority expressed limitations of chatbots' ability to support everyday well-being. Our analysis reveals how chaplains perceive their pastoral care duties and areas where AI chatbots fall short, along the themes of Listening, Connecting, Carrying, and Wanting. These themes resonate with the idea of attunement, recently highlighted as a relational lens for understanding the delicate experiences care technologies provide. This perspective informs chatbot design aimed at supporting well-being in non-clinical contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Jang, Orevaoghene Ahia, Nazif Tamer, Sachin Kumar, Yulia Tsvetkov, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Music understanding is a complex task that often requires reasoning over both structural and semantic elements of audio. We introduce BASS, designed to evaluate music understanding and reasoning in audio language models across four broad categories: structural segmentation, lyric transcription, musicological analysis, and artist collaboration. BASS comprises 2658 questions spanning 12 tasks, 1993 unique songs and covering over 138 hours of music from a wide range of genres and tracks, crafted to assess musicological knowledge and reasoning in real-world scenarios. We evaluate 14 open-source and frontier multimodal LMs, finding that even state-of-the-art models struggle on higher-level reasoning tasks such as structural segmentation and artist collaboration, while performing best on lyric transcription. Our analysis reveals that current models leverage linguistic priors effectively but remain limited in reasoning over musical structure, vocal, and musicological attributes. BASS provides an evaluation framework with widespread applications in music recommendation and search and has the potential to guide the development of audio LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Lin, Sirou Zhu, Yilei Chen, Mingyu Chen, Hejian Sang, Ioannis Paschalidis, Zhipeng Wang, Aldo Pacchiano, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04099">Rethinking Perplexity: Revealing the Impact of Input Length on Perplexity Evaluation in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Cheng, Junyan Wang, Yan Gao, Elliott Wen, Ting Dang, Hong Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Li, Chengsong Huang, Langlin Huang, Shaoyang Xu, Haolin Liu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiaxin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takanori Ashihara, Shota Horiguchi, Kohei Matsuura, Tsubasa Ochiai, Marc Delcroix</p>
<p>Abstract: Discretized representations of speech signals are efficient alternatives to continuous features for various speech applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech language models. However, these representations, such as semantic or phonetic tokens derived from clustering outputs of self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, are susceptible to environmental noise, which can degrade backend task performance. In this work, we introduce a frontend system that estimates clean speech tokens from noisy speech and evaluate it on an ASR backend using semantic tokens. We consider four types of enhancement models based on their input/output domains: wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL features-to-token, and wave-to-token. These models are trained independently of ASR backends. Experiments on the CHiME-4 dataset demonstrate that wave-to-token enhancement achieves the best performance among the frontends. Moreover, it mostly outperforms the ASR system based on continuous SSL features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeming Wei, Qiaosheng Zhang, Xia Hu, Xingcheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved tremendous success with their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet also face safety issues similar to those of basic language models. In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Lu, Haoyuan Huang, Yulin Zhou, Chen Li, Ningxin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Zhu, Zhanghao Hu, Qinglin Zhu, Yuxi Hong, Yijun Liu, Jingyong Su, Yulan He, Lin Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chien-Chun Wang, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang, Berlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SeungWon Seo, SooBin Lim, SeongRae Noh, Haneul Kim, HyeongYeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyi Chen, Eun Cheol Choi, Yingjia Luo, Xinyi Wang, Yulei Xiao, Aizi Yang, Luca Luceri</p>
<p>Abstract: People increasingly seek advice online from both human peers and large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and classifying user personas is critical for delivering effective personalization. While persona information offers valuable insights, its full potential is realized only when contextualized, linking user characteristics with situational context to enable more precise and meaningful service provision. Existing systems often treat persona and context as separate inputs, limiting their ability to generate nuanced, adaptive interactions. To address this gap, we present PersoPilot, an agentic AI-Copilot that integrates persona understanding with contextual analysis to support both end users and analysts. End users interact through a transparent, explainable chat interface, where they can express preferences in natural language, request recommendations, and receive information tailored to their immediate task. On the analyst side, PersoPilot delivers a transparent, reasoning-powered labeling assistant, integrated with an active learning-driven classification process that adapts over time with new labeled data. This feedback loop enables targeted service recommendations and adaptive personalization, bridging the gap between raw persona data and actionable, context-aware insights. As an adaptable framework, PersoPilot is applicable to a broad range of service personalization scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Kramer, Henrich R. Greve, Moritz von Zahn, Hayagreeva Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Conspiracy theories can threaten society by spreading misinformation, deepening polarization, and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameh Khattab, Marie Bauer, Lukas Heine, Till Rostalski, Jens Kleesiek, Julian Friedrich</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has rapidly increased the need for high-quality, curated information retrieval datasets. These datasets, however, are currently created with off-the-shelf annotation tools that make the annotation process complex and inefficient. To streamline this process, we developed a specialized annotation tool - AIANO. By adopting an AI-augmented annotation workflow that tightly integrates human expertise with LLM assistance, AIANO enables annotators to leverage AI suggestions while retaining full control over annotation decisions. In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO. AIANO nearly doubled annotation speed compared to the baseline while being easier to use and improving retrieval accuracy. These results demonstrate that AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and enhances dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, advancing annotation capabilities in retrieval-intensive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianbiao Qi, Marco Chen, Jiaquan Ye, Yelin He, Rong Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eun Cheol Choi, Lindsay E. Young, Emilio Ferrara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haina Zhu, Yao Xiao, Xiquan Li, Ziyang Ma, Jianwei Yu, Bowen Zhang, Mingqi Yang, Xie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the fine-grained text-to-audio (T2A) generation task. While recent models can synthesize high-quality audio from text descriptions, they often lack precise control over attributes such as loudness, pitch, and sound events. Unlike prior approaches that retrain models for specific control types, we propose to train ControlNet models on top of pre-trained T2A backbones to achieve controllable generation over loudness, pitch, and event roll. We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Miller, Florent Draye, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengru Wang, Zhenqian Xu, Junfeng Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Molly Apsel, Michael N. Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'at\'e Gedeon, P\'eter Mihajlik</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816">Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqing Yuan (Fanny), Lichao Sun (Fanny),  Yanfang (Fanny),  Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishaq Aden-Ali, Noah Golowich, Allen Liu, Abhishek Shetty, Ankur Moitra, Nika Haghtalab</p>
<p>Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Qi, Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offensive speech detection is a key component of content moderation. However, what is offensive can be highly subjective. This paper investigates how machine and human moderators disagree on what is offensive when it comes to real-world social web political discourse. We show that (1) there is extensive disagreement among the moderators (humans and machines); and (2) human and large-language-model classifiers are unable to predict how other human raters will respond, based on their political leanings. For (1), we conduct a noise audit at an unprecedented scale that combines both machine and human responses. For (2), we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset of vicarious offense. Our noise audit reveals that moderation outcomes vary wildly across different machine moderators. Our experiments with human moderators suggest that political leanings combined with sensitive issues affect both first-person and vicarious offense.

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive conversational capabilities, their proficiency in delivering personalized responses remains unclear. Although recent benchmarks automatically evaluate persona consistency in role-playing contexts using LLM-based judgment, the evaluation of personalization in response generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present an automated benchmarking pipeline, PersoBench, to evaluate the personalization ability of LLMs in persona-aware dialogue generation within a zero-shot setting. Our framework employs a structured pipeline comprising speaker-aware annotation, task-specific and context-driven prompt construction, response post-processing, and automated evaluation across multiple dimensions of generation quality. In particular, the pipeline performs text preprocessing and speaker labeling, constructs structured prompts with task instructions and LLM roles, validates response format, and evaluates valid outputs across fluency, personalization, diversity, and coherence. We assess the performance of four open-source and four closed-source LLMs using well-known datasets and a range of explicit metrics. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel at generating fluent and diverse responses, they are far from satisfactory in delivering personalized and coherent responses, considering both the conversation context and the provided personas.</p>

<p>Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to improve text quality and readability. Previous work on the task focused primarily on high-resource languages, while low-resource languages lack robust tools. To address this shortcoming, we present a study on GEC for Zarma, a language spoken by over five million people in West Africa. We compare three approaches: rule-based methods, machine translation (MT) models, and large language models (LLMs). We evaluated GEC models using a dataset of more than 250,000 examples, including synthetic and human-annotated data. Our results showed that the MT-based approach using M2M100 outperforms others, with a detection rate of 95.82% and a suggestion accuracy of 78.90% in automatic evaluations (AE) and an average score of 3.0 out of 5.0 in manual evaluation (ME) from native speakers for grammar and logical corrections. The rule-based method was effective for spelling errors but failed on complex context-level errors. LLMs -- Gemma 2b and MT5-small -- showed moderate performance. Our work supports use of MT models to enhance GEC in low-resource settings, and we validated these results with Bambara, another West African language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Shuhaib Mehri, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Beyond the concern of how LLMs persuade others, their own susceptibility to persuasion poses a critical alignment challenge, raising questions about robustness, safety, and adherence to ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasiveness and susceptibility to persuasion in multi-agent interactions. Our framework offers a scalable alternative to the costly and time-intensive human annotation process typically used to study persuasion in LLMs. PMIYC automatically conducts multi-turn conversations between Persuader and Persuadee agents, measuring both the effectiveness of and susceptibility to persuasion. Our comprehensive evaluation spans a diverse set of LLMs and persuasion settings (e.g., subjective and misinformation scenarios). We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and demonstrate alignment with human assessments from prior studies. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p>

Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Yang, Yikang Shen, Kaiyue Wen, Shawn Tan, Mayank Mishra, Liliang Ren, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH improves upon RoPE and other recent baselines. Finally, we show that we can convert pretrained RoPE transformers into PaTH with continued pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuekun Yao, Yupei Du, Dawei Zhu, Michael Hahn, Alexander Koller</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Jinlong Ma, Yongshuai Hou, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Jun Yu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success on complex multi-modal tasks. However, it remains insufficiently explored whether they exhibit $\textbf{modality preference}$, a tendency to favor one modality over another when processing multi-modal contexts. To study this question, we introduce $\textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}}$ benchmark, which constructs controlled evidence-conflict scenarios to systematically evaluate modality preference in decision-making. Extensive experiments reveal that all 20 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate clear modality preferences, and such preferences can serve as a useful indicator of downstream task performance of MLLMs. Further analysis shows that modality preference can be controlled by instruction guidance and captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on these insights, we propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to explicitly control modality preference without requiring additional fine-tuning. This method effectively amplifies modality preference toward a desired direction and demonstrates promising improvements across multiple multi-modal understanding and reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaotian Weng, Haoxuan Li, Xin Eric Wang, Kuan-Hao Huang, Jieyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance. Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for future work on causal understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in clinical decision support, yet current evaluations rarely reveal whether their outputs reflect genuine medical reasoning or superficial correlations. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework that probes fine-grained clinical understanding through controlled counterfactuals. Using intensive care unit (ICU) discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, we construct both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) variants with single-variable perturbations in demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate eight LLMs, spanning general-purpose and medical variants, under zero-shot setting. Model behavior is analyzed through (1) input-level sensitivity, capturing how counterfactuals alter perplexity, and (2) downstream reasoning, measuring their effect on predicted ICU length-of-stay and mortality. Overall, our results show that standard task metrics obscure clinically relevant differences in model behavior, with models differing substantially in how consistently and proportionally they adjust predictions to counterfactual perturbations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components: document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28 languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.</p>

Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods.

The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.

<p>Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. Furthermore, ASR-derived utterance timestamps provide access to pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. Yet, their added value beyond semantic measures remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we evaluated a scalable multimodal framework that integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY), and dream narratives (PsyCL). Pause-related features were evaluated alongside established coherence measures using support vector regression to predict clinical FTD scores. Models using pause features alone robustly predict manually rated FTD severity consistently across datasets. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to coherence-only models, with late fusion yielding the most robust and consistent gains in all three datasets. On average across datasets, Spearman correlation increased from \r{ho} = 0.413 for semantic-only models to \r{ho} = 0.455 with late fusion. The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of the most informative pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that both pause dynamics and semantic coherence reflect complementary aspects of thought disorganization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariya Mukherjee-Gandhi, Oliver Muellerklein</p>
<p>Abstract: Artists occupy a paradoxical position in generative AI: their work trains the models reshaping creative labor. We tested whether their concerns achieve proportional representation in public discourse shaping AI governance. Analyzing public AI-art discourse (news, podcasts, legal filings, research; 2013--2025) and projecting 1,259 survey-derived artist statements into this semantic space, we find stark compression: 95% of artist concerns cluster in 4 of 22 discourse topics, while 14 topics (62% of discourse) contain no artist perspective. This compression is selective - governance concerns (ownership, transparency) are 7x underrepresented; affective themes (threat, utility) show only 1.4x underrepresentation after style controls. The pattern indicates semantic, not stylistic, marginalization. These findings demonstrate a measurable representational gap: decision-makers relying on public discourse as a proxy for stakeholder priorities will systematically underweight those most affected. We introduce a consensus-based semantic projection methodology that is currently being validated across domains and generalizes to other stakeholder-technology contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dara Bahri, John Wieting</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woongkyu Lee, Junhee Cho, Jungwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation from single-function tasks to competitive-programming problems, but existing multi-agent solutions either rely on costly large-scale (>30B) models or collapse when downsized to small open-source models. We present MapCoder-Lite, a framework for distilling the complex reasoning of large, multi-agent coding systems into a single 7B model. Our contribution is a novel, three-pillar methodology that synergistically generates, refines, and encodes multi-agent knowledge: (i) pass-based trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and reduces failures in debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction with global feedback strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from 13.2% to 28.3%), eliminates all format failures, while reducing GPU memory and token-generation time by 4x compared to a 32B model. It also achieves over 10% gains on simpler coding benchmarks, demonstrating broad improvements beyond competitive programming. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.

<p>Abstract: Progress in large language models is increasingly constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: benchmarks must be built and models run before iteration can begin. We investigate whether evaluation outcomes can be forecast before any experiments are conducted. Specifically, we study text-only performance prediction, where models estimate performance from task descriptions and experimental configurations alone, without access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a test split using papers published after the evaluated models' knowledge cutoff. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve a non-trivial forecasting skill reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high-confidence thresholds. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Lin, Xiaohan Wang, Jie Cao, Jiajun Chai, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies, yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards. Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by $4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaorui Shi, Yuxin Chen, Siyuan Wang, Sihang Li, Hengxing Cai, Qi Gu, Xiang Wang, An Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering, where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens. Existing works equip large language models with a memory buffer that is dynamically updated via a linear document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from pruning of latent evidence, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, which integrates the mechanism of memory retrieval into the memory update process, enabling the agent to selectively callback historical memories for non-linear reasoning. To further strengthen training, we propose a multi-level reward design, which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support complex multi-hop reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMemR1 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-context question answering while incurring negligible computational overhead, validating its ability to trade marginal cost for robust long-context reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on diverse tasks, their trustworthiness is limited by erratic behavior that is unfaithful to their internal knowledge. In particular, LLMs often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) even if they encode correct answers in their hidden representations, revealing a misalignment between internal knowledge and output behavior. We investigate and mitigate this knowledge-prediction gap on MCQs through a three-step analysis of hidden representations. First, we quantify the prevalence and magnitude of the gap across models and datasets. Second, we provide a geometric interpretation by identifying distinct knowledge and prediction subspaces in the residual stream. Third, we introduce KAPPA, a lightweight inference-time intervention that aligns the two subspaces within the residual stream to reduce the knowledge-prediction gap. Our results provide a geometric and interpretable explanation of the knowledge-prediction gap in LLMs. Furthermore, KAPPA effectively reduces the gap across diverse MCQ benchmarks and models, and generalizes to free-form settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Lee, Cheol Jun Cho, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijun Zhu, Ning Yang, Baoliang Tian, Jiayu Wei, Weihao Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Pin Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Yang, Yuxuan Fan, Songning Lai, Shengen Wu, Jiaqi Tang, Chun Kang, Zhijiang Guo, Yutao Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight, we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that canonical search agents trained via Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) -- including SearchR1 and ReSearch -- have significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS(Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve better task performance compared to the baselines trained against pure outcome-based reward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Gurgurov, Tanja Baeumel, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit substantial performance disparities across languages, particularly between high- and low-resource settings. We propose a framework for improving performance in underrepresented languages while preserving general-purpose capabilities via targeted fine-tuning of sparse, language-associated subnetworks. Our approach identifies language-relevant neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE), an information-theoretic metric that reliably captures language-specific activation patterns, and fine-tunes only the corresponding weights. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages show that our method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA, IA^3, and random-subset baselines while updating only 0.2-1% of model parameters. We further show that sparse, neuron-targeted fine-tuning can inject new language capabilities without catastrophic forgetting, with potential applicability to other model capabilities. Mechanistic analyses of weight updates and internal representations reveal asymmetric roles of FFN projections in language adaptation and improved cross-lingual alignment. Finally, we release language neuron sets for over 100 languages together with our adaptation pipeline, enabling a cost-effective path for extending LLMs to underrepresented languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Giarrusso, Olga E. Sorokoletova, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize risk categories rather than jailbreaking techniques. To advance the understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a structured red-teaming challenge. The outcomes of our experiments are fourfold. First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of jailbreak strategies that systematically consolidates techniques previously studied in isolation and harmonizes existing, partially overlapping classifications with explicit cross-references to prior categorizations. The taxonomy organizes jailbreak strategies into seven mechanism-oriented families: impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we benchmarked GPT-5 as a judge for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues, annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Ruixuan Tu, Chengtao Dai, Smit Vasani, You Li, Binwei Yao, Michael Henry Tessler, Sijia Yang, Dhavan Shah, Robert Hawkins, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for understanding and mitigating polarization, misinformation, and societal conflict. Recent work simulates opinion dynamics with role-playing LLM agents (RPLAs), but multi-agent simulations often display unnatural group behavior (e.g., premature convergence) and lack empirical benchmarks for assessing alignment with real human group interactions. We introduce DEBATE, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of opinion dynamics in multi-agent RPLA simulations. DEBATE contains 36,383 messages from 2,832 U.S.-based participants across 708 groups and 107 topics, with both public messages and private Likert-scale beliefs, enabling evaluation at the utterance and group levels (and supporting future individual-level analyses). We instantiate "digital twin" RPLAs with seven LLMs and evaluate across two settings: next-message prediction and full conversation rollout, using stance-alignment and opinion-convergence metrics. In zero-shot settings, RPLA groups exhibit strong opinion convergence relative to human groups. Post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves stance alignment and brings group-level convergence closer to human behavior, though discrepancies in opinion change and belief updating remain. DEBATE enables rigorous benchmarking of simulated opinion dynamics and supports future research on aligning multi-agent RPLAs with realistic human interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yair Elboher, Yuval Pinter</p>
<p>Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task. In this work, we present DiVRit, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set, conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DiVRit is its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model to process diacritized candidates as images, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within their vector representations while the surrounding context remains tokenization-based. Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates, DiVRit achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities. These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Li, Ruocheng Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Wu, Hai Wang, Jiajia Wu, Jinxiang Ou, Keyao Wang, Weile Chen, Zihao Zheng, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.</p>

First, we describe the rationale and the methodology for creating the synthetic corpus. Second, we examine expressions of agency, modality, and information flow across four clinical genres (Assessments, Correspondence, Referrals and Care plans) with the aim to understand how LLMs grammatically construct medical authority and patient agency through linguistic choices. While LLMs produce coherent, terminology-appropriate texts that approximate clinical practice, systematic divergences remain, including registerial shifts, insufficient clinical specificity, and inaccuracies in medication use and diagnostic procedures. The results show both the potential and limitations of synthetic corpora for enabling large-scale linguistic research otherwise impossible with genuine patient records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakir Hasan, Shrestha Datta, Md Saiful Islam, Shubhashis Roy Dipta, Ameya Debnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its widespread use, Bengali lacks a robust automated International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription system that effectively supports both standard language and regional dialectal texts. Existing approaches struggle to handle regional variations, numerical expressions, and generalize poorly to previously unseen words. To address these limitations, we propose BanglaIPA, a novel IPA generation system that integrates a character-based vocabulary with word-level alignment. The proposed system accurately handles Bengali numerals and demonstrates strong performance across regional dialects. BanglaIPA improves inference efficiency by leveraging a precomputed word-to-IPA mapping dictionary for previously observed words. The system is evaluated on the standard Bengali and six regional variations of the DUAL-IPA dataset. Experimental results show that BanglaIPA outperforms baseline IPA transcription models by 58.4-78.7% and achieves an overall mean word error rate of 11.4%, highlighting its robustness in phonetic transcription generation for the Bengali language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haorui Yu, Ramon Ruiz-Dolz, Xuehang Wen, Fengrui Zhang, Qiufeng Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual perception, yet their ability to interpret cultural meaning in art remains under-validated. However, cultural understanding and interpretability are often overlooked when evaluating these models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a tri-tier evaluation framework for cross-cultural art-critique assessment. Tier I provides a series of automated metrics indicating cultural coverage. Tier II leverages theory-informed template-based scoring using a single primary judge across five evaluation dimensions (Coverage, Alignment, Depth, Accuracy, Quality), each rated on a 1--5 scale. Tier III then calibrates the aggregated scores from Tier II via isotonic regression. The proposed evaluation framework is validated with a large-scale experiment covering 15 different VLMs on 294 evaluation art-critique pairs spanning six different cultural traditions. Our findings reveal that (i) automated metrics are unreliable for cultural depth analysis, (ii) Western samples score higher than non-Western samples under our sampling and evaluation template, highlighting potential model biases, and (iii) VLMs exhibit a consistent performance gap, performing well in visual description but underperforming in cultural interpretation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Naveed Mahmood, Md. Rezaur Rahman Bhuiyan, Tasfia Zaman, Jareen Tasneem Khondaker, Md. Sameer Sakib, K. M. Shadman Wadith, Nazia Tasnim, Farig Sadeque</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baktash Ansari, Elias Martin, Afra Mashhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglong Cao, Yuntian Chen, Chao Ma, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biswesh Mohapatra, Marcely Zanon Boito, Ioan Calapodescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Xiaoqing Tan, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Jing Xu, Ping Yu, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Olga Golovneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dani Roytburg, Matthew Bozoukov, Matthew Nguyen, Mackenzie Puig-Hall, Narmeen Oozeer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) favor their own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

Beyond the standard attention mechanism, ROSA-Tuning leverages in parallel a CPU-based ROSA (RWKV Online Suffix Automaton) retrieval module, which efficiently locates historical positions in long contexts that are relevant to the current query, and injects the retrieved information into the model state in a trainable manner; subsequent weighted fusion can then be handled by range-restricted attention. To enable end-to-end training, we employ the binary discretization strategy and the counterfactual gradient algorithm, and further optimize overall execution efficiency via an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline. Systematic evaluations on Qwen3-Base-1.7B show that ROSA-Tuning substantially restores the long-context modeling ability of windowed-attention models, achieving performance close to and in some cases matching global attention on benchmarks such as LongBench, while maintaining computational efficiency and GPU memory usage that are nearly comparable to windowed-attention methods, offering a new technical path for efficient long-context processing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Polina Tsvilodub, Karl Mulligan, Todd Snider, Robert D. Hawkins, Michael Franke</p>
<p>Abstract: When deciding how to act under uncertainty, agents may choose to act to reduce uncertainty or they may act despite that uncertainty. In communicative settings, an important way of reducing uncertainty is by asking clarification questions (CQs). We predict that the decision to ask a CQ depends on both contextual uncertainty and the cost of alternative actions, and that these factors interact: uncertainty should matter most when acting incorrectly is costly. We formalize this interaction in a computational model based on expected regret: how much an agent stands to lose by acting now rather than with full information. We test these predictions in two experiments, one examining purely linguistic responses to questions and another extending to choices between clarification and non-linguistic action. Taken together, our results suggest a rational tradeoff: humans tend to seek clarification proportional to the risk of substantial loss when acting under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitao Gao, Jie Ma, Xuhong Li, Pengyu Li, Ning Qu, Yaqiang Wu, Hui Liu, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in complex reasoning but remain bottlenecked by reliance on expert-annotated data and external verifiers. While existing self-evolution paradigms aim to bypass these constraints, they often fail to identify the optimal learning zone and risk reinforcing collective hallucinations and incorrect priors through flawed internal feedback. To address these challenges, we propose \underline{A}utonomous \underline{E}volutionary \underline{R}easoning \underline{O}ptimization (AERO), an unsupervised framework that achieves autonomous reasoning evolution by internalizing self-questioning, answering, and criticism within a synergistic dual-loop system. Inspired by the \textit{Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)} theory, AERO utilizes entropy-based positioning to target the ``solvability gap'' and employs Independent Counterfactual Correction for robust verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Staggered Training Strategy to synchronize capability growth across functional roles and prevent curriculum collapse. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmarks spanning three domains demonstrate that AERO achieves average performance improvements of 4.57\% on Qwen3-4B-Base and 5.10\% on Qwen3-8B-Base, outperforming competitive baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Shi, Jialong Shi, Jiayi Wang, Ye Fan, Jianyong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Operations Research (OR) relies on expert-driven modeling-a slow and fragile process ill-suited to novel scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs. We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-horizon omnimodal question answering answers questions by reasoning over text, images, audio, and video. Despite recent progress on OmniLLMs, low-resource long audio-video QA still suffers from costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, limited proactive planning, and no clear end-to-end optimization.To address these issues, we propose OmniRAG-Agent, an agentic omnimodal QA method for budgeted long audio-video reasoning. It builds an image-audio retrieval-augmented generation module that lets an OmniLLM fetch short, relevant frames and audio snippets from external banks. Moreover, it uses an agent loop that plans, calls tools across turns, and merges retrieved evidence to answer complex queries. Furthermore, we apply group relative policy optimization to jointly improve tool use and answer quality over time. Experiments on OmniVideoBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show that OmniRAG-Agent consistently outperforms prior methods under low-resource settings and achieves strong results, with ablations validating each component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Dong, Shaowei Wang, Dayi Lin, Boyuan Chen, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings. Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megha Srivastava, Cedric Colas, Dorsa Sadigh, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like generalization, interpretability, and inter-operability with human users. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the high-level strategies underlying rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a *rule generation* step guided by language models, and an *update* step where agents learn new policies guided by rules, even when a rule is insufficient to describe an entire complex policy. Across five diverse tasks, including a two-player signaling game, maze navigation, image reconstruction, and robot grasp planning, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination. We provide source code for our experiments at https://github.com/meghabyte/bottleneck .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Brice Magdalou, John Lambert, Ehsan Amid, Richard Nock, Andrew Hard</p>
<p>Abstract: Normative theories allow one to elicit key parts of a ML algorithm from first principles, which is crucial at a time of championed scrutiny for ML work. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) cleverly bypasses reward modeling by making an explicit link with a specific normative model of human choice. Our paper elevates this connection to the full generality of DPO's normative framework. Getting there requires reworking human choice theory's textbook path for a better RLHF/ML fit. It elevates the connection to a remarkably broad viewpoint on preference optimization, considering the current panorama of DPO follow-ups. It also unveils unexpected riches for ML, chief among which the support for non-convex losses, the fact that any compliant ML analytical choice can be embedded with any human choice model, and a normative framework's umbrella wide enough to safeguard DPO's extensions (margins, length correction, ...). A toy experiment ``far away'' from the DPO crowd is given.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple ``futures'' may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation. We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying MCL to language modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with experiments on visual and audio captioning, as well as machine translation, that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs. The accompanying code and a general-purpose package for applying LoRA-MCL to a wide range of language models are made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Ximing Lu, Mingjie Liu, Yi Dong, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing LLMs' capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows, thereby improving precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the limits of RLVR. We examine how RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves \texttt{pass@1}, \textit{the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets}, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, it results in greater uncertainty at each generation step and declining answer-level entropy. This indicates that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, we reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash requires future innovations that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, traditionally requiring high-quality large-scale data and extensive training. Recent works reveal a very appealing Less-Is-More phenomenon where very small, carefully curated high-quality datasets match resource-intensive approaches. In this work, we further systematically relax their quality constraints by adding controlled noise via persona context relevance and comparing datasets of different qualities. Counterintuitively, we find that mixing relevant and irrelevant contexts consistently across training and inference stages yields optimal results -- a phenomenon we term training-testing co-design. Dataset quality comparisons show that high-quality data benefits weaker models on easy questions, while low-quality data achieves higher scores on hard questions with capable models. Across our experiments, reasoning performance is linked to reasoning efficiency. We, for the first time, found adding noisy and irrelevant contexts into queries can improve reasoning efficiency without any prices and targeted designs. Building on these insights, we propose Input-Time Scaling: applying small, low-quality data to capable models with training-testing co-design. This maintains Less-Is-More while further removing labor-intensive quality curation and improving reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, making the approach more applicable and affordable. Our method achieves 76.7% pass@1 on AIME24/25 using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and 90.0%/80.0% with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B -- state-of-the-art among Qwen2.5-32B variants. We are open-sourcing our datasets, pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: While virtual reality (VR) excels at simulating physical environments, its effectiveness for training complex interpersonal skills is limited by a lack of psychologically plausible virtual humans. This gap is particularly critical in medical education, where communication is a core clinical competency. This paper introduces a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into immersive VR to create medically coherent virtual patients with distinct, consistent personalities, based on a modular architecture that decouples personality from clinical data. We evaluated the system in a mixed-methods, within-subjects study with licensed physicians conducting simulated consultations. Results suggest that the approach is feasible and perceived as a rewarding and effective training enhancement. Our analysis highlights key design principles, including a "realism-verbosity paradox" and the importance of challenges being perceived as clinically authentic to support learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Vincent Tu, Chih-Lun Lee, Jiachen Yang, Ang Li, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their performance on long-horizon, complex problems remains unreliable. Single-rollout execution is brittle, with small errors compounding over time and leading to high variance in outcomes. While prior work has attempted to scale within a single rollout, such approaches have yielded limited gains. Scaling over multiple rollouts offers a more promising alternative but doing so effectively is challenging due to the difficulty of evaluating and selecting among long-horizon agent behaviors. We introduce Behavior Judge (BJudge), which addresses this challenge by representing agent executions as behavior narratives and comparing candidate behaviors at this level, substantially improving robustness and success rates. Using multiple rollouts, BJudge establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) in OSWorld at 72.6%, significantly outperforming prior methods and surpassing human-level performance at 72.36%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the strong effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and BJudge provides a practical framework to achieve this.</p>

Our approach leverages a Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW) encoder to extract target-speaker embeddings, which are concatenated into a single representation and passed to a shared decoder. This enables the model to transcribe overlapping speech as a serialized output stream with speaker tags and timestamps. In contrast to target-speaker ASR systems such as DiCoW, which decode each speaker separately, our approach performs joint decoding, allowing the decoder to condition on the context of all speakers simultaneously. Experiments show that the model outperforms existing SOT-based approaches and surpasses DiCoW on multi-talker mixtures (e.g., LibriMix).</p>

<p>Abstract: Online fake news profoundly distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social platforms. While existing detectors achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets, they remain notably vulnerable to malicious comments designed specifically to induce misclassification. This evolving threat landscape necessitates detection systems that simultaneously prioritize predictive accuracy and structural robustness. However, current detectors often fail to generalize across diverse and novel comment attack patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose AdComment, an adaptive adversarial training framework for robustness enhancement against diverse malicious comments. Based on cognitive psychology, we categorize adversarial comments into Fact Distortion, Logical Confusion, and Emotional Manipulation, and leverage LLMs to synthesize diverse, category-specific perturbations. Central to our framework is an InfoDirichlet Resampling (IDR) mechanism that dynamically adjusts malicious comment proportions during training, thereby steering optimization toward the model's most susceptible regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, improving the F1 scores by 17.9%, 14.5% and 9.0%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Aggazzotti, Ashi Garg, Zexin Cai, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose a new approach that performs a contextual rewriting of the transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility. Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure anonymity in long-form audio.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable inference-time improvements through parallel thinking. However, existing methods rely on redundant sampling of reasoning trajectories, failing to effectively explore the reasoning space to uncover high-quality solutions. To address these limitations, we propose Decoding Tree Sketching (DTS), a plug-and-play decoding framework for structural multi-trajectory exploration and reasoning selection. For reasoning exploration, DTS sketches a backbone tree of the reasoning space by selectively branching at decision tokens. For reasoning selection, guided by length-accuracy anti-correlation, DTS designs an early termination to prioritize short and reliable trajectories during decoding. Experimental results across four LRMs and datasets demonstrate that DTS significantly enhances accuracy by 14% and reduces repetitive generation by 8% on average. Notably, DTS enables smaller models to outperform larger models with 10$\times$ the size, highlighting its potential to strengthen reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embodied assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of positional embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential generation to simultaneously think, listen, and write outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning: it allows models to generate accurate thinking-augmented answers while reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to ${\le}$ 5s and the overall real-time delays by up to $12{\times}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg Grynets, Vasyl Lyashkevych, Dmytro Baran, Maksym Orliansky, Taras Zelenyy, Markiian Leshchyshyn</p>
<p>Abstract: The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Audio-LLMs and Omni-models, spoken dialogue systems have evolved significantly, progressively narrowing the gap between human-machine and human-human interactions. Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present EvasionBench, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting evasive responses in corporate earnings call question-and-answer sessions. Drawing from 22.7 million Q&A pairs extracted from S&P Capital IQ transcripts, we construct a rigorously filtered dataset and introduce a three-level evasion taxonomy: direct, intermediate, and fully evasive. Our annotation pipeline employs a Multi-Model Consensus (MMC) framework, combining dual frontier LLM annotation with a three-judge majority voting mechanism for ambiguous cases, achieving a Cohen's Kappa of 0.835 on human inter-annotator agreement. We release: (1) a balanced 84K training set, (2) a 1K gold-standard evaluation set with expert human labels, and (3) [Eva-4B], a 4-billion parameter classifier fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B that achieves 84.9% Macro-F1, outperforming Claude 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 Flash. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-model consensus labeling over single-model annotation. EvasionBench fills a critical gap in financial NLP by providing the first large-scale benchmark specifically targeting managerial communication evasion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Yuling Shi, Mo Yang, Rongrui Zhang, Shilin He, Heng Lian, Yuting Chen, Siyu Ye, Kai Cai, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified while even improving success rates, and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixian Zhao, Wenjie Tian, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiecong Wang, Hao Peng, Chunyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ni, Weijia Zhang, Fei Wang, Zezhi Shao, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective numerical-visual modality integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien Dang, The-Hai Nguyen, Dinh Mai Phuong, Nguyen Minh Phuong, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Le-Minh Nguyen, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ed Li, Junyu Ren, Cat Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +16.7pp while quality metrics improve by up to 47%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent systems on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxin Guo, Jingwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiliang Song, Hongjun An, Jiangong Xiao, Haofei Zhao, Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.</p>
