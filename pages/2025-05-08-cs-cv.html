<p><b>Authors:</b> Gracjan G\'oral, Alicja Ziarko, Piotr Mi{\l}o\'s, Micha{\l} Nauman, Maciej Wo{\l}czyk, Micha{\l} Kosi\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform visual perspective taking using a novel set of visual tasks inspired by established human tests. Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which a single humanoid minifigure is paired with a single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both bird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests a gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minji Kang, Seongho Kim, Eunseo Go, Donghyeon Paek, Geon Lim, Muyoung Kim, Soyeun Kim, Sung Kyu Jang, Min Sup Choi, Woo Seok Kang, Jaehyun Kim, Jaekwang Kim, Hyeong-U Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise monitoring of etch depth and the thickness of insulating materials, such as Silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, is critical to ensuring device performance and yield in semiconductor manufacturing. While conventional ex-situ analysis methods are accurate, they are constrained by time delays and contamination risks. To address these limitations, this study proposes a non-contact, in-situ etch depth prediction framework based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Two scenarios are explored. In the first scenario, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to predict average etch depth from process parameters, achieving a significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) compared to a linear baseline model. The approach is then extended to incorporate variability from repeated measurements using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Coverage analysis confirms the BNN's capability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In the second scenario, we demonstrate the feasibility of using RGB data from digital image colorimetry (DIC) as input for etch depth prediction, achieving strong performance even in the absence of explicit process parameters. These results suggest that the integration of DIC and ML offers a viable, cost-effective alternative for real-time, in-situ, and non-invasive monitoring in plasma etching processes, contributing to enhanced process stability, and manufacturing efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread availability of video recording through smartphones and digital devices has made video-based evidence more accessible than ever. Surveillance footage plays a crucial role in security, law enforcement, and judicial processes. However, with the rise of advanced video editing tools, tampering with digital recordings has become increasingly easy, raising concerns about their authenticity. Ensuring the integrity of surveillance videos is essential, as manipulated footage can lead to misinformation and undermine judicial decisions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing forensic techniques used to detect video forgery, focusing on their effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of surveillance recordings. Various methods, including compression-based analysis, frame duplication detection, and machine learning-based approaches, are explored. The findings highlight the growing necessity for more robust forensic techniques to counteract evolving forgery methods. Strengthening video forensic capabilities will ensure that surveillance recordings remain credible and admissible as legal evidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechao Wang, Sven Nomm, Junqing Huang, Kadri Medijainen, Aaro Toomela, Michael Ruzhansky</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown potential in analyzing digitized hand-drawn signals for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, the lack of clear interpretability in existing diagnostic methods presents a challenge to clinical trust. In this paper, we propose PointExplainer, an explainable diagnostic strategy to identify hand-drawn regions that drive model diagnosis. Specifically, PointExplainer assigns discrete attribution values to hand-drawn segments, explicitly quantifying their relative contributions to the model's decision. Its key components include: (i) a diagnosis module, which encodes hand-drawn signals into 3D point clouds to represent hand-drawn trajectories, and (ii) an explanation module, which trains an interpretable surrogate model to approximate the local behavior of the black-box diagnostic model. We also introduce consistency measures to further address the issue of faithfulness in explanations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a newly constructed dataset show that PointExplainer can provide intuitive explanations with no diagnostic performance degradation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03837">Explainable Face Recognition via Improved Localization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashik Shadman, Daqing Hou, Faraz Hussain, M G Sarwar Murshed</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric authentication has become one of the most widely used tools in the current technological era to authenticate users and to distinguish between genuine users and imposters. Face is the most common form of biometric modality that has proven effective. Deep learning-based face recognition systems are now commonly used across different domains. However, these systems usually operate like black-box models that do not provide necessary explanations or justifications for their decisions. This is a major disadvantage because users cannot trust such artificial intelligence-based biometric systems and may not feel comfortable using them when clear explanations or justifications are not provided. This paper addresses this problem by applying an efficient method for explainable face recognition systems. We use a Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based discriminative localization (very narrow/specific localization) technique called Scaled Directed Divergence (SDD) to visually explain the results of deep learning-based face recognition systems. We perform fine localization of the face features relevant to the deep learning model for its prediction/decision. Our experiments show that the SDD Class Activation Map (CAM) highlights the relevant face features very specifically compared to the traditional CAM and very accurately. The provided visual explanations with narrow localization of relevant features can ensure much-needed transparency and trust for deep learning-based face recognition systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangsheng Wang, Yuhang Li, Chengwei Ye, Yufei Lin, Huanzhen Zhang, Bohan Hu, Linuo Xu, Shuyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Apparent personality analysis from short videos poses significant chal-lenges due to the complex interplay of visual, auditory, and textual cues. In this paper, we propose GAME, a Graph-Augmented Multimodal Encoder designed to robustly model and fuse multi-source features for automatic personality prediction. For the visual stream, we construct a facial graph and introduce a dual-branch Geo Two-Stream Network, which combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) with attention mechanisms to capture both structural and appearance-based facial cues. Complementing this, global context and iden-tity features are extracted using pretrained ResNet18 and VGGFace back-bones. To capture temporal dynamics, frame-level features are processed by a BiGRU enhanced with temporal attention modules. Meanwhile, audio representations are derived from the VGGish network, and linguistic se-mantics are captured via the XLM-Roberta transformer. To achieve effective multimodal integration, we propose a Channel Attention-based Fusion module, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression head for predicting personality traits. Extensive experiments show that GAME con-sistently outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, vali-dating its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03848">Advanced Clustering Framework for Semiconductor Image Analytics Integrating Deep TDA with Self-Supervised and Transfer Learning Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Janhavi Giri, Attila Lengyel, Don Kent, Edward Kibardin</p>
<p>Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing generates vast amounts of image data, crucial for defect identification and yield optimization, yet often exceeds manual inspection capabilities. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with high-dimensional, unlabeled data, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns. This paper introduces an advanced clustering framework that integrates deep Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with self-supervised and transfer learning techniques, offering a novel approach to unsupervised image clustering. TDA captures intrinsic topological features, while self-supervised learning extracts meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing reliance on labeled datasets. Transfer learning enhances the framework's adaptability and scalability, allowing fine-tuning to new datasets without retraining from scratch. Validated on synthetic and open-source semiconductor image datasets, the framework successfully identifies clusters aligned with defect patterns and process variations. This study highlights the transformative potential of combining TDA, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning, providing a scalable solution for proactive process monitoring and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing and other domains with large-scale image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tin Mi\v{s}i\'c, Karlo Koledi\'c, Fabio Bonsignorio, Ivan Petrovi\'c, Ivan Markovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to selectively attend to relevant stimuli while filtering out distractions is essential for agents that process complex, high-dimensional sensory input. This paper introduces a model of covert and overt visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy. The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03896">Novel Extraction of Discriminative Fine-Grained Feature to Improve Retinal Vessel Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Zeng, Chee Hong Lee, Micky C Nnamdi, Wenqi Shi, J Ben Tamo, Lei Zhu, Hangzhou He, Xinliang Zhang, Qian Chen, May D. Wang, Yanye Lu, Qiushi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is a vital early detection method for several severe ocular diseases. Despite significant progress in retinal vessel segmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still challenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to predict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary focus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more discriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on minimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label, but ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the encoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped Kolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we implement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model sensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model interpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also design a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our proposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing between foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are conducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF and our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%, 80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and 66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for retinal vessel segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our AttUKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing retinal vessel segmentation methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03974">Deep Learning Framework for Infrastructure Maintenance: Crack Detection and High-Resolution Imaging of Infrastructure Surfaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil M. Pawar, Jorge A. Prozzi, Feng Hong, Surya Sarat Chandra Congress</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an impetus for the application of cutting-edge data collection platforms such as drones mounted with camera sensors for infrastructure asset management. However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video event detection has become an essential component of sports analytics, enabling automated identification of key moments and enhancing performance analysis, viewer engagement, and broadcast efficiency. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly improved accuracy and efficiency in Temporal Action Localization (TAL), Action Spotting (AS), and Precise Event Spotting (PES). This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these three key tasks, emphasizing their differences, applications, and the evolution of methodological approaches. We thoroughly review and categorize existing datasets and evaluation metrics specifically tailored for sports contexts, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. Furthermore, we analyze state-of-the-art techniques, including multi-modal approaches that integrate audio and visual information, methods utilizing self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation, and approaches aimed at generalizing across multiple sports. Finally, we discuss critical open challenges and outline promising research directions toward developing more generalized, efficient, and robust event detection frameworks applicable to diverse sports.

<p>Abstract: The unique vascularized anatomy of the human eye, encased in the retina, provides an opportunity to act as a window for human health. The retinal structure assists in assessing the early detection, monitoring of disease progression and intervention for both ocular and non-ocular diseases. The advancement in imaging technology leveraging Artificial Intelligence has seized this opportunity to bridge the gap between the eye and human health. This track paves the way for unveiling systemic health insight from the ocular system and surrogating non-invasive markers for timely intervention and identification. The new frontiers of oculomics in ophthalmology cover both ocular and systemic diseases, and getting more attention to explore them. In this survey paper, we explore the evolution of retinal imaging techniques, the dire need for the integration of AI-driven analysis, and the shift of retinal imaging from classical techniques to oculomics. We also discuss some hurdles that may be faced in the progression of oculomics, highlighting the research gaps and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ervin Wang, Yuhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately tracking food consumption is crucial for nutrition and health monitoring. Traditional approaches typically require specific camera angles, non-occluded images, or rely on gesture recognition to estimate intake, making assumptions about bite size rather than directly measuring food volume. We propose the FoodTrack framework for tracking and measuring the volume of hand-held food items using egocentric video which is robust to hand occlusions and flexible with varying camera and object poses. FoodTrack estimates food volume directly, without relying on intake gestures or fixed assumptions about bite size, offering a more accurate and adaptable solution for tracking food consumption. We achieve absolute percentage loss of approximately 7.01% on a handheld food object, improving upon a previous approach that achieved a 16.40% mean absolute percentage error in its best case, under less flexible conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Xiao, Hongbin Xu, Guocan Zhao, Wenxiong Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the unique target described by natural languages in 3D scenes. The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the perception of referred objects. We propose a novel 2D-assisted 3D visual grounding framework that constructs semantic-spatial scene graphs with referred object discrimination for relationship perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that utilizes 2D pre-trained attributes to guide the multi-modal object encoding. Furthermore, our cross-modal interaction module uses graph attention to facilitate relationship-oriented information fusion. The enhanced object representation and iterative relational learning enable the model to establish effective alignment between 3D vision and referential descriptions. Experimental results on the popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in addressing the challenges of multiple similar distractors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Hu, Yichun Hu, Ling-Yu Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance model robustness against distribution shifts through rapid model adaptation during inference. While existing TTA methods often rely on entropy-based unsupervised training and achieve promising results, the common practice of a single round of entropy training is typically unable to adequately utilize reliable samples, hindering adaptation efficiency. In this paper, we discover augmentation strategies can effectively unleash the potential of reliable samples, but the rapidly growing computational cost impedes their real-time application. To address this limitation, we propose a novel TTA approach named Single-step Ensemble of Vicinal Augmentations (SEVA), which can take advantage of data augmentations without increasing the computational burden. Specifically, instead of explicitly utilizing the augmentation strategy to generate new data, SEVA develops a theoretical framework to explore the impacts of multiple augmentations on model adaptation and proposes to optimize an upper bound of the entropy loss to integrate the effects of multiple rounds of augmentation training into a single step. Furthermore, we discover and verify that using the upper bound as the loss is more conducive to the selection mechanism, as it can effectively filter out harmful samples that confuse the model. Combining these two key advantages, the proposed efficient loss and a complementary selection strategy can simultaneously boost the potential of reliable samples and meet the stringent time requirements of TTA. The comprehensive experiments on various network architectures across challenging testing scenarios demonstrate impressive performances and the broad adaptability of SEVA. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shang Zhang, Huanbin Zhang, Dali Feng, Yujie Cui, Ruoyan Xiong, Cen He</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking often suffers from challenges such as target occlusion, motion blur, and background clutter, which significantly degrade the performance of trackers. To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Zhang, Hao Wang, Shuchang Ye, Michael Fulham, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Patient motion during medical image acquisition causes blurring, ghosting, and distorts organs, which makes image interpretation challenging.Current state-of-the-art algorithms using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods with their ability to learn the mappings between corrupted images and their ground truth via Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss effectively generate motion-free images. However, we identified the following limitations: (i) they mainly focus on global structural characteristics and therefore overlook localized features that often carry critical pathological information, and (ii) the SSIM loss function struggles to handle images with varying pixel intensities, luminance factors, and variance. In this study, we propose Motion-Aware Image SYnthesis (MAISY) which initially characterize motion and then uses it for correction by: (a) leveraging the foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), to dynamically learn spatial patterns along anatomical boundaries where motion artifacts are most pronounced and, (b) introducing the Variance-Selective SSIM (VS-SSIM) loss which adaptively emphasizes spatial regions with high pixel variance to preserve essential anatomical details during artifact correction. Experiments on chest and head CT datasets demonstrate that our model outperformed the state-of-the-art counterparts, with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) increasing by 40%, SSIM by 10%, and Dice by 16%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengya Liu, Siyuan Li, Ajad Chhatkuli, Prune Truong, Luc Van Gool, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D object pose estimation remains challenging for many applications due to dependencies on complete 3D models, multi-view images, or training limited to specific object categories. These requirements make generalization to novel objects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be available. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture from a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that require multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiang Ai, Zichen Liu, Yuanhang Lei, Zhenyu Cui, Xu Zou, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained 3D vision models have gained significant attention for their promising performance on point cloud data. However, fully fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is computationally expensive and storage-intensive. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, which focus primarily on input token prompting, struggle to achieve competitive performance due to their limited ability to capture the geometric information inherent in point clouds. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometry-Aware Point Cloud Prompt (GAPrompt) that leverages geometric cues to enhance the adaptability of 3D vision models. First, we introduce a Point Prompt that serves as an auxiliary input alongside the original point cloud, explicitly guiding the model to capture fine-grained geometric details. Additionally, we present a Point Shift Prompter designed to extract global shape information from the point cloud, enabling instance-specific geometric adjustments at the input level. Moreover, our proposed Prompt Propagation mechanism incorporates the shape information into the model's feature extraction process, further strengthening its ability to capture essential geometric characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GAPrompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods and achieves competitive results compared to full fine-tuning on various benchmarks, while utilizing only 2.19% of trainable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiang Ai, Zichen Liu, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision GNN (ViG) demonstrates superior performance by representing images as graph structures, providing a more natural way to capture irregular semantic patterns beyond traditional grid or sequence-based representations. To efficiently adapt ViG to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompting become increasingly essential. However, existing prompting methods are primarily designed for Transformer-based models, neglecting the rich topological relationships among nodes and edges in graph-based representations, limiting their capacity to model complex semantics. In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties. Building on this observation, we introduce a semantic low-rank prompting method that decomposes low-rank semantic features and integrates them with prompts on vision graph topologies, capturing both global structural patterns and fine-grained semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly improves ViG's transfer performance on diverse downstream tasks, achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning while maintaining parameter efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixing Niu, Jiapeng Li, Xingping Yu, Shu Wang, Ruining Feng, Bo Wu, Ping Wei, Yisen Wang, Lifeng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: "Read the room" is a significant social reasoning capability in human daily life. Humans can infer others' mental states from subtle social cues. Previous social reasoning tasks and datasets lack complexity (e.g., simple scenes, basic interactions, incomplete mental state variables, single-step reasoning, etc.) and fall far short of the challenges present in real-life social interactions. In this paper, we contribute a valuable, high-quality, and comprehensive video dataset named R^3-VQA with precise and fine-grained annotations of social events and mental states (i.e., belief, intent, desire, and emotion) as well as corresponding social causal chains in complex social scenarios. Moreover, we include human-annotated and model-generated QAs. Our task R^3-VQA includes three aspects: Social Event Understanding, Mental State Estimation, and Social Causal Reasoning. As a benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the social reasoning capabilities and consistencies of current state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). Comprehensive experiments show that (i) LVLMs are still far from human-level consistent social reasoning in complex social scenarios; (ii) Theory of Mind (ToM) prompting can help LVLMs perform better on social reasoning tasks. We provide some of our dataset and codes in supplementary material and will release our full dataset and codes upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yamaoka or Weng Ian Chan, Shigeto Seno, Soichiro Fukada, Hideo Matsuda</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naphat Nithisopa, Teerapong Panboonyuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text recognition in natural images remains a challenging yet essential task, with broad applications spanning computer vision and natural language processing. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines ResNet and Vision Transformer backbones with advanced methodologies, including Deformable Convolutions, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). These innovations collectively enhance feature representation and improve Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance. Specifically, the framework substitutes standard convolution layers in the third and fourth blocks with Deformable Convolutions, leverages adaptive dropout for regularization, and incorporates CRF for more refined sequence modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets IC13, IC15, SVT, IIIT5K, SVTP, and CUTE80 validate the proposed method's efficacy, achieving notable accuracies: 97.32% on IC13, 58.26% on IC15, 88.10% on SVT, 74.13% on IIIT5K, 82.17% on SVTP, and 66.67% on CUTE80, resulting in an average accuracy of 77.77%. These results establish a new state-of-the-art for text recognition, demonstrating the robustness of the approach across diverse and challenging datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D models from 2D sketches is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and sparsity of sketch data. In this paper, we present S3D, a novel framework that converts simple hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D models. Our method utilizes a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture to convert sketches into face segmentation masks, which are then used to generate a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel views. To ensure robust consistency between the sketch domain and the 3D output, we introduce a novel style-alignment loss that aligns the U-Net bottleneck features with the initial encoder outputs of the 3D generation module, significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity. To further enhance the network's robustness, we apply augmentation techniques to the sketch dataset. This streamlined framework demonstrates the effectiveness of S3D in generating high-quality 3D models from sketch inputs.

<p>Abstract: We present VideoPath-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, single patch images, automatically keyframe-extracted clips, and manually segmented video pathology images, to mimic the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, VideoPath-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning.
  Central to our approach is the VideoPath-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. VideoPath-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Cheng, Jinan Xu, Jialing Chen, Wenjuan Han</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of integrating tactile sensing into intelligent systems for multimodal reasoning, particularly in enabling commonsense reasoning about the open-ended physical world. We identify two key challenges: modality discrepancy, where existing large touch-language models often treat touch as a mere sub-modality of language, and open-ended tactile data scarcity, where current datasets lack the diversity, open-endness and complexity needed for reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SToLa, a Self-Adaptive Touch-Language framework. SToLa utilizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) to dynamically process, unify, and manage tactile and language modalities, capturing their unique characteristics. Crucially, we also present a comprehensive tactile commonsense reasoning dataset and benchmark featuring free-form questions and responses, 8 physical properties, 4 interactive characteristics, and diverse commonsense knowledge. Experiments show SToLa exhibits competitive performance compared to existing models on the PhysiCLeAR benchmark and self-constructed datasets, proving the effectiveness of the Mixture of Experts architecture in multimodal management and the performance advantages for open-scenario tactile commonsense reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Yurdakul, \c{S}akir Tasdemir</p>
<p>Abstract: Potholes cause vehicle damage and traffic accidents, creating serious safety and economic problems. Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is crucial. Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and cannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this paper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and an improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and pothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was used to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a PothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable for segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg architecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure more accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps with high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision, 85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to 93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in precision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model performs pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high accuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model complexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in deep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.</p>

<p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of key-value information from handwritten documents is a key challenge in document analysis. A reliable extraction is a prerequisite for the mass digitization efforts of many archives. Large Vision Language Models (LVLM) are a promising technology to tackle this problem especially in scenarios where little annotated training data is available. In this work, we present a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs. The CM1 documents are a historic collection of forms with handwritten entries created in Europe to administer the Care and Maintenance program after World War Two. The dataset establishes three benchmarks on extracting name and birthdate information and, furthermore, considers different training set sizes. We provide baseline results for two different LVLMs and compare performances to an established full-page extraction model. While the traditional full-page model achieves highly competitive performances, our experiments show that when only a few training samples are available the considered LVLMs benefit from their size and heavy pretraining and outperform the classical approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of labeled high-resolution imagery have long challenged remote sensing applications, particularly in low-income regions where high-resolution data are scarce. In this study, we propose a weak supervision framework that estimates parking lot occupancy using 3m resolution satellite imagery. By leveraging coarse temporal labels -- based on the assumption that parking lots of major supermarkets and hardware stores in Germany are typically full on Saturdays and empty on Sundays -- we train a pairwise comparison model that achieves an AUC of 0.92 on large parking lots. The proposed approach minimizes the reliance on expensive high-resolution images and holds promise for scalable urban mobility analysis. Moreover, the method can be adapted to assess transit patterns and resource allocation in vulnerable communities, providing a data-driven basis to improve the well-being of those most in need.</p>

<p>Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to advance text-to-3D generation but neglects multi-view correlations, being prone to geometric inconsistencies and multi-face artifacts in the generated 3D content. In this work, we propose Coupled Score Distillation (CSD), a framework that couples multi-view joint distribution priors to ensure geometrically consistent 3D generation while enabling the stable and direct optimization of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a multi-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule that effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across different viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets. Additionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically consistent 3D content. We further employ a deformable tetrahedral grid, initialized from 3D-GS and refined through CSD, to produce high-quality, refined meshes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and competitive quality of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Egocentric video grounding is a crucial task for embodied intelligence applications, distinct from exocentric video moment localization. Existing methods primarily focus on the distributional differences between egocentric and exocentric videos but often neglect key characteristics of egocentric videos and the fine-grained information emphasized by question-type queries. To address these limitations, we propose OSGNet, an Object-Shot enhanced Grounding Network for egocentric video. Specifically, we extract object information from videos to enrich video representation, particularly for objects highlighted in the textual query but not directly captured in the video features. Additionally, we analyze the frequent shot movements inherent to egocentric videos, leveraging these features to extract the wearer's attention information, which enhances the model's ability to perform modality alignment. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that OSGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

<p>Abstract: We propose HDiffTG, a novel 3D Human Pose Estimation (3DHPE) method that integrates Transformer, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and diffusion model into a unified framework. HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design.

This integration enhances the model's ability to handle pose estimation under occlusions and in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce lightweight optimizations to the integrated model and refine the objective function design to reduce computational overhead without compromising performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Jiangnan Xia, Jianghan Cheng, Qilong Wu, Junwei Li, Yibin Tian, Hui Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel Two-Stage Diffusion Model (TS-Diff) for enhancing extremely low-light RAW images. In the pre-training stage, TS-Diff synthesizes noisy images by constructing multiple virtual cameras based on a noise space. Camera Feature Integration (CFI) modules are then designed to enable the model to learn generalizable features across diverse virtual cameras. During the aligning stage, CFIs are averaged to create a target-specific CFI$^T$, which is fine-tuned using a small amount of real RAW data to adapt to the noise characteristics of specific cameras. A structural reparameterization technique further simplifies CFI$^T$ for efficient deployment. To address color shifts during the diffusion process, a color corrector is introduced to ensure color consistency by dynamically adjusting global color distributions. Additionally, a novel dataset, QID, is constructed, featuring quantifiable illumination levels and a wide dynamic range, providing a comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluation under extreme low-light conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including QID, SID, and ELD, excelling in denoising, generalization, and color consistency across various cameras and illumination levels. These findings highlight the robustness and versatility of TS-Diff, making it a practical solution for low-light imaging applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiannan Fan, Zhuoyang Li, Jitong Li, Chenyang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous impact of epidemics, people have become accustomed to wearing masks. However, most current occluded face recognition (OFR) algorithms lack prior knowledge of occlusions, resulting in poor performance when dealing with occluded faces of varying types and severity in reality. Recognizing occluded faces is still a significant challenge, which greatly affects the convenience of people's daily lives. In this paper, we propose an identity-gated mixture of diffusion experts (MoDE) for OFR. Each diffusion-based generative expert estimates one possible complete image for occluded faces. Considering the random sampling process of the diffusion model, which introduces inevitable differences and variations between the inpainted faces and the real ones. To ensemble effective information from multi-reconstructed faces, we introduce an identity-gating network to evaluate the contribution of each reconstructed face to the identity and adaptively integrate the predictions in the decision space. Moreover, our MoDE is a plug-and-play module for most existing face recognition models. Extensive experiments on three public face datasets and two datasets in the wild validate our advanced performance for various occlusions in comparison with the competing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Zhou, Yingying Deng, Xiangyu He, Weiming Dong, Fan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications, such as interactive photo retouching, artistic content creation, and product design, require flexible and iterative image editing. However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyu Li, Pencheng Wan, Liang Han, Yaowei Wang, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stable Diffusion has advanced text-to-image synthesis, but training models to generate images with accurate object quantity is still difficult due to the high computational cost and the challenge of teaching models the abstract concept of quantity. In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04369">WDMamba: When Wavelet Degradation Prior Meets Vision Mamba for Image Dehazing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Sun, Heng Liu, Yongzhen Wang, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Mingqiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a novel haze-specific wavelet degradation prior observed through wavelet transform analysis, which shows that haze-related information predominantly resides in low-frequency components. Exploiting this insight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the image dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration followed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to effectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process, resulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency restoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures with linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a coarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates fine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous phase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail retention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization during network training. By utilizing the coarse restored output as a hard negative example, our model learns more discriminative representations, substantially boosting the overall dehazing performance. Extensive evaluations on public dehazing benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moseli Mots'oehli, Hope Mogale, Kyungim Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks on ImageNet for downstream tasks is well-established. Still, the impact of model size on the performance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under label noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of transformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under low-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy and calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning settings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large with 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations (Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label noise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular) consistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and calibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers exhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch sizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently worse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find that information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful accuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer calibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially at high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance for practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained environments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute efficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zili Zhang, Ziting Wen, Yiheng Qiang, Hongzhou Dong, Wenle Dong, Xinyang Li, Xiaofan Wang, Xiaoqiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-photon LiDAR achieves high-precision 3D imaging in extreme environments through quantum-level photon detection technology. Current research primarily focuses on reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse photon events, whereas the semantic interpretation of single-photon images remains underexplored, due to high annotation costs and inefficient labeling strategies. This paper presents the first active learning framework for single-photon image classification. The core contribution is an imaging condition-aware sampling strategy that integrates synthetic augmentation to model variability across imaging conditions. By identifying samples where the model is both uncertain and sensitive to these conditions, the proposed method selectively annotates only the most informative examples. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms all baselines and achieves high classification accuracy with significantly fewer labeled samples. Specifically, our approach achieves 97% accuracy on synthetic single-photon data using only 1.5% labeled samples. On real-world data, we maintain 90.63% accuracy with just 8% labeled samples, which is 4.51% higher than the best-performing baseline. This illustrates that active learning enables the same level of classification performance on single-photon images as on classical images, opening doors to large-scale integration of single-photon data in real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04380">Tetrahedron-Net for Medical Image Registration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhai Xiang, Shuai Guo, Qianru Han, Dantong Shi, Xinwei He, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image registration plays a vital role in medical image processing. Extracting expressive representations for medical images is crucial for improving the registration quality. One common practice for this end is constructing a convolutional backbone to enable interactions with skip connections among feature extraction layers. The de facto structure, U-Net-like networks, has attempted to design skip connections such as nested or full-scale ones to connect one single encoder and one single decoder to improve its representation capacity. Despite being effective, it still does not fully explore interactions with a single encoder and decoder architectures. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce a simple yet effective alternative strategy to enhance the representations for registrations by appending one additional decoder. The new decoder is designed to interact with both the original encoder and decoder. In this way, it not only reuses feature presentation from corresponding layers in the encoder but also interacts with the original decoder to corporately give more accurate registration results. The new architecture is concise yet generalized, with only one encoder and two decoders forming a ``Tetrahedron'' structure, thereby dubbed Tetrahedron-Net. Three instantiations of Tetrahedron-Net are further constructed regarding the different structures of the appended decoder. Our extensive experiments prove that superior performance can be obtained on several representative benchmarks of medical image registration. Finally, such a ``Tetrahedron'' design can also be easily integrated into popular U-Net-like architectures including VoxelMorph, ViT-V-Net, and TransMorph, leading to consistent performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Hui Liu, Xiao-Qian Liu, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake attribution (DFA) aims to perform multiclassification on different facial manipulation techniques, thereby mitigating the detrimental effects of forgery content on the social order and personal reputations. However, previous methods focus only on method-specific clues, which easily lead to overfitting, while overlooking the crucial role of common forgery features. Additionally, they struggle to distinguish between uncertain novel classes in more practical open-world scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an innovative multi-DisentAnglement based conTrastive leArning framework, DATA, to enhance the generalization ability on novel classes for the open-world semi-supervised deepfake attribution (OSS-DFA) task. Specifically, since all generation techniques can be abstracted into a similar architecture, DATA defines the concept of 'Orthonormal Deepfake Basis' for the first time and utilizes it to disentangle method-specific features, thereby reducing the overfitting on forgery-irrelevant information. Furthermore, an augmented-memory mechanism is designed to assist in novel class discovery and contrastive learning, which aims to obtain clear class boundaries for the novel classes through instance-level disentanglements. Additionally, to enhance the standardization and discrimination of features, DATA uses bases contrastive loss and center contrastive loss as auxiliaries for the aforementioned modules. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OSS-DFA benchmark, e.g., there are notable accuracy improvements in 2.55% / 5.7% under different settings, compared with the existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04392">Predicting Road Surface Anomalies by Visual Tracking of a Preceding Vehicle</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Petr Jahoda, Jan Cech</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a preceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard consumer hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Hu Park, Rae-Hong Park, Hyung-Min Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an efficient visual speech encoder for lip reading. While most recent lip reading studies have been based on the ResNet architecture and have achieved significant success, they are not sufficiently suitable for efficiently capturing lip reading features due to high computational complexity in modeling spatio-temporal information. Additionally, using a complex visual model not only increases the complexity of lip reading models but also induces delays in the overall network for multi-modal studies (e.g., audio-visual speech recognition, speech enhancement, and speech separation). To overcome the limitations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, we apply the hierarchical structure and window self-attention of the Swin Transformer to lip reading. We configure a new lightweight scale of the Swin Transformer suitable for processing lip reading data and present the SwinLip visual speech encoder, which efficiently reduces computational load by integrating modified Convolution-augmented Transformer (Conformer) temporal embeddings with conventional spatial embeddings in the hierarchical structure. Through extensive experiments, we have validated that our SwinLip successfully improves the performance and inference speed of the lip reading network when applied to various backbones for word and sentence recognition, reducing computational load. In particular, our SwinLip demonstrated robust performance in both English LRW and Mandarin LRW-1000 datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Mandarin LRW-1000 dataset with less computation compared to the existing state-of-the-art model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04397">Deep residual learning with product units</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Li, Uwe Jaekel, Babette Dellen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a deep product-unit residual neural network (PURe) that integrates product units into residual blocks to improve the expressiveness and parameter efficiency of deep convolutional networks. Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wang, Bin Chen, Yulin Li, Bin Kang, Yichi Chen, Zhuotao Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense visual prediction tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Hui Liu, Harry Cheng, Tianyi Wang, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake detection models often struggle with generalization to unseen datasets, manifesting as misclassifying real instances as fake in target domains. This is primarily due to an overreliance on forgery artifacts and a limited understanding of real faces. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach RealID to enhance generalization by learning a comprehensive concept of real faces while assessing the probabilities of belonging to the real and fake classes independently. RealID comprises two key modules: the Real Concept Capture Module (RealC2) and the Independent Dual-Decision Classifier (IDC). With the assistance of a MultiReal Memory, RealC2 maintains various prototypes for real faces, allowing the model to capture a comprehensive concept of real class. Meanwhile, IDC redefines the classification strategy by making independent decisions based on the concept of the real class and the presence of forgery artifacts. Through the combined effect of the above modules, the influence of forgery-irrelevant patterns is alleviated, and extensive experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate that RealID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 1.74% improvement in average accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Li, Weijian Ma, Xueyang Li, Yunzhong Lou, Guichun Zhou, Xiangdong Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas. This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Frame-Averaging Kernel-Point Convolution (FA-KPConv), a neural network architecture built on top of the well-known KPConv, a widely adopted backbone for 3D point cloud analysis. Even though invariance and/or equivariance to Euclidean transformations are required for many common tasks, KPConv-based networks can only approximately achieve such properties when training on large datasets or with significant data augmentations. Using Frame Averaging, we allow to flexibly customize point cloud neural networks built with KPConv layers, by making them exactly invariant and/or equivariant to translations, rotations and/or reflections of the input point clouds. By simply wrapping around an existing KPConv-based network, FA-KPConv embeds geometrical prior knowledge into it while preserving the number of learnable parameters and not compromising any input information. We showcase the benefit of such an introduced bias for point cloud classification and point cloud registration, especially in challenging cases such as scarce training data or randomly rotated test data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Samaddar, Yixuan Sun, Viktor Nilsson, Sandeep Madireddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.</p>

<p>Abstract: The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them. Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities. To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies. Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts. One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments. To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04502">Leveraging Simultaneous Usage of Edge GPU Hardware Engines for Video Face Detection and Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Baobaid, Mahmoud Meribout</p>
<p>Abstract: Video face detection and recognition in public places at the edge is required in several applications, such as security reinforcement and contactless access to authorized venues. This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of hardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency and pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also includes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring applications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet network. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks are usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and automated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In addition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or within raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding stage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using all the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher throughput, and a slight saving of power consumption of around 300 mW, accounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time performance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several video streams simultaneously. Further performance improvement could have been obtained if the number of shuffle layers that were created by the tensor RT framework for the face recognition task was lower. Thus, the paper suggests some hardware improvements to the existing edge GPU processors to enhance their performance even higher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Hu, Zhentao Yu, Zhengguang Zhou, Sen Liang, Yuan Zhou, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific subjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often struggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper, we propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework that emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and text conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the image-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion module based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce identity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned generation, we further propose modality-specific condition injection mechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial cross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates latent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment network. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios demonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open- and closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video alignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks, including audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving strategies in advancing controllable video generation.

<p>Abstract: Generating 3D CT volumes from descriptive free-text inputs presents a transformative opportunity in diagnostics and research. In this paper, we introduce Text2CT, a novel approach for synthesizing 3D CT volumes from textual descriptions using the diffusion model. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed-format text input, Text2CT employs a novel prompt formulation that enables generation from diverse, free-text descriptions. The proposed framework encodes medical text into latent representations and decodes them into high-resolution 3D CT scans, effectively bridging the gap between semantic text inputs and detailed volumetric representations in a unified 3D framework. Our method demonstrates superior performance in preserving anatomical fidelity and capturing intricate structures as described in the input text. Extensive evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, offering promising potential applications in diagnostics, and data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Baobaid, Mahmoud Meribout</p>
<p>Abstract: Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhou, Yukai Shi, Xiaojun Yang, Xiaoyu Xian, Lunjia Liao, Ruimao Zhang, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the field of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural information and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks. However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Humes, Xiaomin Lin, Uttej Kallakuri, Tinoosh Mohsenin</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation is a powerful computer vision technique for scene understanding. However, real-world deployment is stymied by the need for high-quality, meticulously labeled datasets. Synthetic data provides high-quality labels while reducing the need for manual data collection and annotation. However, deep neural networks trained on synthetic data often face the Syn2Real problem, leading to poor performance in real-world deployments.
  To mitigate the aforementioned gap in image segmentation, we propose RAFT, a novel framework for adapting image segmentation models using minimal labeled real-world data through data and feature augmentations, as well as active learning. To validate RAFT, we perform experiments on the synthetic-to-real "SYNTHIA->Cityscapes" and "GTAV->Cityscapes" benchmarks. We managed to surpass the previous state of the art, HALO. SYNTHIA->Cityscapes experiences an improvement in mIoU* upon domain adaptation of 2.1%/79.9%, and GTAV->Cityscapes experiences a 0.4%/78.2% improvement in mIoU. Furthermore, we test our approach on the real-to-real benchmark of "Cityscapes->ACDC", and again surpass HALO, with a gain in mIoU upon adaptation of 1.3%/73.2%. Finally, we examine the effect of the allocated annotation budget and various components of RAFT upon the final transfer mIoU.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04540">Registration of 3D Point Sets Using Exponential-based Similarity Matrix</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Singandhupe, Sanket Lokhande, Hung Manh La</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics, involving the alignment of 3D point sets captured from varying viewpoints using depth sensors such as LiDAR or structured light. In modern robotic systems, especially those focused on mapping, it is essential to merge multiple views of the same environment accurately. However, state-of-the-art registration techniques often struggle when large rotational differences exist between point sets or when the data is significantly corrupted by sensor noise. These challenges can lead to misalignments and, consequently, to inaccurate or distorted 3D reconstructions. In this work, we address both these limitations by proposing a robust modification to the classic Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Our method, termed Exponential Similarity Matrix ICP (ESM-ICP), integrates a Gaussian-inspired exponential weighting scheme to construct a similarity matrix that dynamically adapts across iterations. This matrix facilitates improved estimation of both rotational and translational components during alignment. We demonstrate the robustness of ESM-ICP in two challenging scenarios: (i) large rotational discrepancies between the source and target point clouds, and (ii) data corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. Our results show that ESM-ICP outperforms traditional geometric registration techniques as well as several recent learning-based methods. To encourage reproducibility and community engagement, our full implementation is made publicly available on GitHub. https://github.com/aralab-unr/ESM_ICP</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunlun Xu, Xu Zou, Gang Hua, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) aims to learn from non-stationary data streams across domains while retaining and utilizing past knowledge. Although prompt-based methods effectively store multi-domain knowledge in prompt parameters and obtain advanced performance through cross-domain prompt fusion, we reveal an intrinsic limitation: component-wise misalignment between domain-specific prompts leads to conflicting knowledge integration and degraded predictions. This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components within prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To address this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a novel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge alignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and inference capacity of the model. KA-Prompt operates in two phases: (1) Initial Componential Structure Configuring, where a set of old prompts containing knowledge relevant to the new domain are mined via greedy search, which is then exploited to initialize new prompts to achieve reusable knowledge transfer and establish intrinsic alignment between new and old prompts. (2) Online Alignment Preservation, which dynamically identifies the target old prompts and applies adaptive componential consistency constraints as new prompts evolve. Extensive experiments on DIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our KA-Prompt. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-KA-Prompt</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Du, Jingshuai Liu, Rohan Dharmakumar, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the superior diagnostic capability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), its use as a Point-of-Care (PoC) device remains limited by high cost and complexity. To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength, one key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has shown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space with fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be made, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential decisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling comprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space data. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to optimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that identifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective using a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two sequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage thickness loss assessment. Our framework achieves diagnostic performance competitive with various policy-based benchmarks on disease detection, severity quantification, and overall sequential diagnosis, while substantially saving k-space samples. Our approach paves the way for the future of MRI as a comprehensive and affordable PoC device. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vios-s/MRI_Sequential_Active_Sampling</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Zhang, Abhinav Kumar, Girish Chandar Ganesan, Xiaoming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianhang Li, Yanqing Liu, Haoqin Tu, Hongru Zhu, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: OpenAI's CLIP, released in early 2021, have long been the go-to choice of vision encoder for building multimodal foundation models. Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p>

Previous methods like COLMAP and GLOMAP are able to estimate high-precision camera poses, but suffer from poor scalability when the number of matched keypoint pairs becomes large. We identify two key factors leading to this problem: poor parallelization and computationally expensive optimization steps. To overcome these issues, we design an SfM framework that relies entirely on GPU-friendly operations, making it easily parallelizable. Moreover, each optimization step runs in time linear to the number of image pairs, independent of keypoint pairs or 3D points. Through extensive experiments, we show that FastMap is one to two orders of magnitude faster than COLMAP and GLOMAP on large-scale scenes with comparable pose accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of whole-body person recognition in unconstrained environments. This problem arises in surveillance scenarios such as those in the IARPA Biometric Recognition and Identification at Altitude and Range (BRIAR) program, where biometric data is captured at long standoff distances, elevated viewing angles, and under adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g., turbulence and high wind velocity). To this end, we propose FarSight, a unified end-to-end system for person recognition that integrates complementary biometric cues across face, gait, and body shape modalities. FarSight incorporates novel algorithms across four core modules: multi-subject detection and tracking, recognition-aware video restoration, modality-specific biometric feature encoding, and quality-guided multi-modal fusion. These components are designed to work cohesively under degraded image conditions, large pose and scale variations, and cross-domain gaps. Extensive experiments on the BRIAR dataset, one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-range, multi-modal biometric recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of FarSight. Compared to our preliminary system, this system achieves a 34.1% absolute gain in 1:1 verification accuracy (TAR@0.1% FAR), a 17.8% increase in closed-set identification (Rank-20), and a 34.3% reduction in open-set identification errors (FNIR@1% FPIR). Furthermore, FarSight was evaluated in the 2025 NIST RTE Face in Video Evaluation (FIVE), which conducts standardized face recognition testing on the BRIAR dataset. These results establish FarSight as a state-of-the-art solution for operational biometric recognition in challenging real-world conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinicius Francisco Rofatto, Luiz Felipe Rodrigues de Almeida, Marcelo Tomio Matsuoka, Ivandro Klein, Mauricio Roberto Veronez, Luiz Gonzaga Da Silveira Junior</p>
<p>Abstract: Coordinate transformation models often fail to account for nonlinear and spatially dependent distortions, leading to significant residual errors in geospatial applications. Here we propose a residual-based neural correction strategy, in which a neural network learns to model only the systematic distortions left by an initial geometric transformation. By focusing solely on residual patterns, the proposed method reduces model complexity and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse or structured control point configurations. We evaluate the method using both simulated datasets with varying distortion intensities and sampling strategies, as well as under the real-world image georeferencing tasks. Compared with direct neural network coordinate converter and classical transformation models, the residual-based neural correction delivers more accurate and stable results under challenging conditions, while maintaining comparable performance in ideal cases. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of residual modelling as a lightweight and robust alternative for improving coordinate transformation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trilok Padhi, Ramneet Kaur, Adam D. Cobb, Manoj Acharya, Anirban Roy, Colin Samplawski, Brian Matejek, Alexander M. Berenbeim, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Susmit Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) tailored for multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Existing state-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses generated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these approaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is consistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with respect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in addition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal models. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The confidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall confidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the pipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric calibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the accuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across multiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and visual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as LLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Zhang, Jianing Hao, Zhan Wang, Hongling Sheng, Wei Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Video story interaction enables viewers to engage with and explore narrative content for personalized experiences. However, existing methods are limited to user selection, specially designed narratives, and lack customization. To address this, we propose an interactive system based on user intent. Our system uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to enable machines to understand video stories, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to create evolving characters and scene experiences. It includes three stages: 1) Video story processing, utilizing VLM and prior knowledge to simulate human understanding of stories across three modalities. 2) Multi-space chat, creating growth-oriented characters through MAS interactions based on user queries and story stages. 3) Scene customization, expanding and visualizing various story scenes mentioned in dialogue. Applied to the Harry Potter series, our study shows the system effectively portrays emergent character social behavior and growth, enhancing the interactive experience in the video story world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Nasios</p>
<p>Abstract: Harmful algal blooms are a growing threat to inland water quality and public health worldwide, creating an urgent need for efficient, accurate, and cost-effective detection methods. This research introduces a high-performing methodology that integrates multiple open-source remote sensing data with advanced artificial intelligence models. Key data sources include Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical imagery, the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) climate data, all efficiently retrieved using platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC). The NIR and two SWIR bands from Sentinel-2, the altitude from the elevation model, the temperature and wind from NOAA as well as the longitude and latitude were the most important features. The approach combines two types of machine learning models, tree-based models and a neural network, into an ensemble for classifying algal bloom severity. While the tree models performed strongly on their own, incorporating a neural network added robustness and demonstrated how deep learning models can effectively use diverse remote sensing inputs. The method leverages high-resolution satellite imagery and AI-driven analysis to monitor algal blooms dynamically, and although initially developed for a NASA competition in the U.S., it shows potential for global application. The complete code is available for further adaptation and practical implementation, illustrating the convergence of remote sensing data and AI to address critical environmental challenges (https://github.com/IoannisNasios/HarmfulAlgalBloomDetection).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suorong Yang, Peng Ye, Furao Shen, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic data selection aims to accelerate training with lossless performance. However, reducing training data inherently limits data diversity, potentially hindering generalization. While data augmentation is widely used to enhance diversity, it is typically not optimized in conjunction with selection. As a result, directly combining these techniques fails to fully exploit their synergies. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel online data training framework that, for the first time, unifies dynamic data selection and augmentation, achieving both training efficiency and enhanced performance. Our method estimates each sample's joint distribution of local density and multimodal semantic consistency, allowing for the targeted selection of augmentation-suitable samples while suppressing the inclusion of noisy or ambiguous data. This enables a more significant reduction in dataset size without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmark datasets and architectures, e.g., reducing 50\% training costs on ImageNet-1k with lossless performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, reinforcing its practical utility in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) is the earliest systematic writing system in China, while the identification of Oracle Bone (OB) duplicates is a fundamental issue in OBI research. In this work, we design a progressive OB duplicate discovery framework that combines unsupervised low-level keypoints matching with high-level text-centric content-based matching to refine and rank the candidate OB duplicates with semantic awareness and interpretability. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art content-based image retrieval and image matching methods, showing that our approach yields comparable recall performance and the highest simplified mean reciprocal rank scores for both Top-5 and Top-15 retrieval results, and with significantly accelerated computation efficiency. We have discovered over 60 pairs of new OB duplicates in real-world deployment, which were missed by OBI researchers for decades.

<p>Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6\%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98\% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vadim Musienko, Axel Jacquet, Ingmar Weber, Till Koebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly used to complement traditional data collection approaches such as surveys and censuses across scientific disciplines. However, we ask: Do all places on earth benefit equally from this new wealth of information? In this study, we investigate coverage bias of major satellite constellations that provide optical satellite imagery with a ground sampling distance below 10 meters, evaluating both the future on-demand tasking opportunities as well as the availability of historic images across the globe. Specifically, forward-looking, we estimate how often different places are revisited during a window of 30 days based on the satellites' orbital paths, thus investigating potential coverage biases caused by physical factors. We find that locations farther away from the equator are generally revisited more frequently by the constellations under study. Backward-looking, we show that historic satellite image availability -- based on metadata collected from major satellite imagery providers -- is influenced by socio-economic factors on the ground: less developed, less populated places have less satellite images available. Furthermore, in three small case studies on recent conflict regions in this world, namely Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, we show that also geopolitical events play an important role in satellite image availability, hinting at underlying business model decisions. These insights lay bare that the digital dividend yielded by satellite imagery is not equally distributed across our planet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sol\`ene Debuys\`ere, Nicolas Trouv\'e, Nathan Letheule, Olivier L\'ev\^eque, Elise Colin</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Will Hawkins, Chris Russell, Brent Mittelstadt</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multimodal machine learning have made text-to-image (T2I) models increasingly accessible and popular. However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Gao, Sheng Liu, Chuanzheng Gong, Xiaowei Zhou, Jiayi Wang, Junyu Dong, Qian Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source remote sensing data joint classification aims to provide accuracy and reliability of land cover classification by leveraging the complementary information from multiple data sources. Existing methods confront two challenges: inter-frequency multi-source feature coupling and inconsistency of complementary information exploration. To solve these issues, we present a Prototype-based Information Compensation Network (PICNet) for land cover classification based on HSI and SAR/LiDAR data. Specifically, we first design a frequency interaction module to enhance the inter-frequency coupling in multi-source feature extraction. The multi-source features are first decoupled into high- and low-frequency components. Then, these features are recoupled to achieve efficient inter-frequency communication. Afterward, we design a prototype-based information compensation module to model the global multi-source complementary information. Two sets of learnable modality prototypes are introduced to represent the global modality information of multi-source data. Subsequently, cross-modal feature integration and alignment are achieved through cross-attention computation between the modality-specific prototype vectors and the raw feature representations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our PICNet over state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/oucailab/PICNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D terrain models are essential in fields such as video game development and film production. Since surface color often correlates with terrain geometry, capturing this relationship is crucial to achieving realism. However, most existing methods generate either a heightmap or a texture, without sufficiently accounting for the inherent correlation. In this paper, we propose a method that jointly generates terrain heightmaps and textures using a latent diffusion model. First, we train the model in an unsupervised manner to randomly generate paired heightmaps and textures. Then, we perform supervised learning of an external adapter to enable user control via hand-drawn sketches. Experiments show that our approach allows intuitive terrain generation while preserving the correlation between heightmaps and textures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositing human figures into scene images has broad applications in areas such as entertainment and advertising. However, existing methods often cannot handle occlusion of the inserted person by foreground objects and unnaturally place the person in the frontmost layer. Moreover, they offer limited control over the inserted person's pose. To address these challenges, we propose two methods. Both allow explicit pose control via a 3D body model and leverage latent diffusion models to synthesize the person at a contextually appropriate depth, naturally handling occlusions without requiring occlusion masks. The first is a two-stage approach: the model first learns a depth map of the scene with the person through supervised learning, and then synthesizes the person accordingly. The second method learns occlusion implicitly and synthesizes the person directly from input data without explicit depth supervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that both methods outperform existing approaches by better preserving scene consistency while accurately reflecting occlusions and user-specified poses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for water robotics, yet traditional onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) approaches are difficult or ineffective due to signal reflection on the water's surface and its high cost of aquatic GNSS receivers. Existing approaches, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic-based methods, face challenges like error accumulation and high computational complexity. Therefore, a more efficient and scalable solution remains necessary. This paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages an aerial drone equipped with GNSS localization to track and localize a marine robot once it is near the surface of the water. Our results show that this novel adaptation enables accurate single and multi-robot marine robot localization.</p>

Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring robust and real-time obstacle avoidance is critical for the safe operation of autonomous robots in dynamic, real-world environments. This paper proposes a neural network framework for predicting the time and collision position of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a dynamic object, using RGB and event-based vision sensors. The proposed architecture consists of two separate encoder branches, one for each modality, followed by fusion by self-attention to improve prediction accuracy. To facilitate benchmarking, we leverage the ABCD [8] dataset collected that enables detailed comparisons of single-modality and fusion-based approaches. At the same prediction throughput of 50Hz, the experimental results show that the fusion-based model offers an improvement in prediction accuracy over single-modality approaches of 1% on average and 10% for distances beyond 0.5m, but comes at the cost of +71% in memory and + 105% in FLOPs. Notably, the event-based model outperforms the RGB model by 4% for position and 26% for time error at a similar computational cost, making it a competitive alternative. Additionally, we evaluate quantized versions of the event-based models, applying 1- to 8-bit quantization to assess the trade-offs between predictive performance and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the trade-offs of multi-modal perception using RGB and event-based cameras in robotic applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating realistic 3D head assets for virtual characters that match a precise artistic vision remains labor-intensive. We present a novel framework that streamlines this process by providing artists with intuitive control over generated 3D heads. Our approach uses a geometry-aware texture synthesis pipeline that learns correlations between head geometry and skin texture maps across different demographics. The framework offers three levels of artistic control: manipulation of overall head geometry, adjustment of skin tone while preserving facial characteristics, and fine-grained editing of details such as wrinkles or facial hair. Our pipeline allows artists to make edits to a single texture map using familiar tools, with our system automatically propagating these changes coherently across the remaining texture maps needed for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces diverse results with clean geometries. We showcase practical applications focusing on intuitive control for artists, including skin tone adjustments and simplified editing workflows for adding age-related details or removing unwanted features from scanned models. This integrated approach aims to streamline the artistic workflow in virtual character creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Binninger, Ruben Wiersma, Philipp Herholz, Olga Sorkine-Hornung</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TetWeave, a novel isosurface representation for gradient-based mesh optimization that jointly optimizes the placement of a tetrahedral grid used for Marching Tetrahedra and a novel directional signed distance at each point. TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay triangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial improvement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave to a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and control of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments. The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulaziz Almuzairee, Rohan Patil, Dwait Bhatt, Henrik I. Christensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of view. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using Q-learning allows the design of more effective representations and optimization of sample efficiency. Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate this, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while augmenting with single-view features to allow lightweight deployment and ensure robust policies. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3. For project website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/mad</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwen Ye, Yuze He, Yanning Zhou, Yiqin Zhu, Kaiwen Xiao, Yong-Jin Liu, Wei Yang, Xiao Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple geometric elements, plays a crucial role in human visual cognition and has broad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D content generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive abstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic understanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling to generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a novel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive assembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned primitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free parameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified manner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive assembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture how humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality primitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining geometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D applications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated content (UGC) in games. Project page: https://primitiveanything.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Xing, Xiaowei Hu, Chi-Wing Fu, Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Pahde, Maximilian Dreyer, Leander Weber, Moritz Weckbecker, Christopher J. Anders, Thomas Wiegand, Wojciech Samek, Sebastian Lapuschkin</p>
<p>Abstract: With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: The latest breakthroughs in large vision-language models, such as Bard and GPT-4, have showcased extraordinary abilities in performing a wide range of tasks. Such models are trained on massive datasets comprising billions of public image-text pairs with diverse tasks. However, their performance on task-specific domains, such as radiology, is still under-investigated and potentially limited due to a lack of sophistication in understanding biomedical images. On the other hand, conversational medical models have exhibited remarkable success but have mainly focused on text-based analysis. In this paper, we introduce XrayGPT, a novel conversational medical vision-language model that can analyze and answer open-ended questions about chest radiographs. Specifically, we align both medical visual encoder (MedClip) with a fine-tuned large language model (Vicuna), using a simple linear transformation. This alignment enables our model to possess exceptional visual conversation abilities, grounded in a deep understanding of radiographs and medical domain knowledge. To enhance the performance of LLMs in the medical context, we generate ~217k interactive and high-quality summaries from free-text radiology reports. These summaries serve to enhance the performance of LLMs through the fine-tuning process. Our approach opens up new avenues the research for advancing the automated analysis of chest radiographs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Asperti, Gabriele Colasuonno, Antonio Guerra</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling the effects of illumination and shadows during head rotation is critical in computer vision for enhancing image realism and reducing artifacts. This study delves into the latent space of denoising diffusion models to identify compelling trajectories that can express continuous head rotation under varying lighting conditions. A key contribution of our work is the generation of additional labels from the CelebA dataset,categorizing images into three groups based on prevalent illumination direction: left, center, and right. These labels play a crucial role in our approach, enabling more precise manipulations and improved handling of lighting variations. Leveraging a recent embedding technique for Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), our method achieves noteworthy manipulations, encompassing a wide rotation angle of $\pm 30$ degrees, while preserving individual distinct characteristics even under challenging illumination conditions. Our methodology involves computing trajectories that approximate clouds of latent representations of dataset samples with different yaw rotations through linear regression. Specific trajectories are obtained by analyzing subsets of data that share significant attributes with the source image, including light direction. Notably, our approach does not require any specific training of the generative model for the task of rotation; we merely compute and follow specific trajectories in the latent space of a pre-trained face generation model. This article showcases the potential of our approach and its current limitations through a qualitative discussion of notable examples. This study contributes to the ongoing advancements in representation learning and the semantic investigation of the latent space of generative models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational AI tools that can generate and discuss clinically correct radiology reports for a given medical image have the potential to transform radiology. Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben Wiersma, Julien Philip, Milo\v{s} Ha\v{s}an, Krishna Mullia, Fujun Luan, Elmar Eisemann, Valentin Deschaintre</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to quantify uncertainty for SVBRDF acquisition in multi-view captures. Under uncontrolled illumination and unstructured viewpoints, there is no guarantee that the observations contain enough information to reconstruct the appearance properties of a captured object. We study this ambiguity, or uncertainty, using entropy and accelerate the analysis by using the frequency domain, rather than the domain of incoming and outgoing viewing angles. The result is a method that computes a map of uncertainty over an entire object within a millisecond. We find that the frequency model allows us to recover SVBRDF parameters with competitive performance, that the accelerated entropy computation matches results with a physically-based path tracer, and that there is a positive correlation between error and uncertainty. We then show that the uncertainty map can be applied to improve SVBRDF acquisition using capture guidance, sharing information on the surface, and using a diffusion model to inpaint uncertain regions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Chenming Wu, Ming Yuan, Yan Zhang, Chen Zhao, Chunyu Song, Haocheng Feng, Errui Ding, Dingwen Zhang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive testing of autonomous systems through simulation is essential to ensure the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. This requires the generation of safety-critical scenarios that extend beyond the limitations of real-world data collection, as many of these scenarios are rare or rarely encountered on public roads. However, evaluating most existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground-truth images. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world. To address this, this paper presents a synthetic dataset for novel driving view synthesis evaluation, which is specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations. This unique dataset includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by $1-4$ meters. It comprises six sequences that cover various times and weather conditions. Each sequence contains $450$ training images, $120$ testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multicamera settings. The experimental findings underscore the significant gap in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiang Zhang, Bingxuan Li, Alexandr Kuznetsov, Akshay Jindal, Stavros Diolatzis, Kenneth Chen, Anton Sochenov, Anton Kaplanyan, Qi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural image representations have emerged as a promising approach for encoding and rendering visual data. Combined with learning-based workflows, they demonstrate impressive trade-offs between visual fidelity and memory footprint. Existing methods in this domain, however, often rely on fixed data structures that suboptimally allocate memory or compute-intensive implicit models, hindering their practicality for real-time graphics applications.
  Inspired by recent advancements in radiance field rendering, we introduce Image-GS, a content-adaptive image representation based on 2D Gaussians. Leveraging a custom differentiable renderer, Image-GS reconstructs images by adaptively allocating and progressively optimizing a group of anisotropic, colored 2D Gaussians. It achieves a favorable balance between visual fidelity and memory efficiency across a variety of stylized images frequently seen in graphics workflows, especially for those showing non-uniformly distributed features and in low-bitrate regimes. Moreover, it supports hardware-friendly rapid random access for real-time usage, requiring only 0.3K MACs to decode a pixel. Through error-guided progressive optimization, Image-GS naturally constructs a smooth level-of-detail hierarchy. We demonstrate its versatility with several applications, including texture compression, semantics-aware compression, and joint image compression and restoration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Based on recent advanced diffusion models, Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated their capabilities to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, leveraging their potential for real-world content creation, particularly in providing users with precise control over the image generation result, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative training-free pipeline that extends existing text-to-image generation models to incorporate a sketch as an additional condition. To generate new images with a layout and structure closely resembling the input sketch, we find that these core features of a sketch can be tracked with the cross-attention maps of diffusion models. We introduce latent optimization, a method that refines the noisy latent at each intermediate step of the generation process using cross-attention maps to ensure that the generated images adhere closely to the desired structure outlined in the reference sketch. Through latent optimization, our method enhances the accuracy of image generation, offering users greater control and customization options in content creation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of controllable human-centric video generation has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly with the advent of diffusion models. However, achieving precise and localized control over human motion in videos, such as replacing or inserting individuals while preserving desired motion patterns, still remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present the ReplaceAnyone framework, which focuses on localized human replacement and insertion featuring intricate backgrounds. Specifically, we formulate this task as an image-conditioned video inpainting paradigm with pose guidance, utilizing a unified end-to-end video diffusion architecture that facilitates image-conditioned video inpainting within masked regions. To prevent shape leakage and enable granular local control, we introduce diverse mask forms involving both regular and irregular shapes. Furthermore, we implement an enriched visual guidance mechanism to enhance appearance alignment, a hybrid inpainting encoder to further preserve the detailed background information in the masked video, and a two-phase optimization methodology to simplify the training difficulty. ReplaceAnyone enables seamless replacement or insertion of characters while maintaining the desired pose motion and reference appearance within a single framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and coherent video content. The proposed ReplaceAnyone can be seamlessly applied not only to traditional 3D-UNet base models but also to DiT-based video models such as Wan2.1.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used in impactful real-life applications. As such, there is a growing need to audit these models to ensure that they generate desirable, task-appropriate images. However, systematically inspecting the associations between prompts and generated content in a human-understandable way remains challenging. To address this, we propose Concept2Concept, a framework where we characterize conditional distributions of vision language models using interpretable concepts and metrics that can be defined in terms of these concepts. This characterization allows us to use our framework to audit models and prompt-datasets. To demonstrate, we investigate several case studies of conditional distributions of prompts, such as user-defined distributions or empirical, real-world distributions. Lastly, we implement Concept2Concept as an open-source interactive visualization tool to facilitate use by non-technical end-users. A demo is available at https://tinyurl.com/Concept2ConceptDemo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grace Luo, Trevor Darrell, Amir Bar</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs) can handle many tasks within a single model, yet the representations that enable this capability remain opaque. We find that VLMs align conceptually equivalent inputs into a shared task vector, which is invariant to modality (text, image) and format (examples, instruction), and may simplify VLM processing. We measure this alignment via cross-modal transfer -- the ability of a task vector derived in one modality to trigger the correct generation in another -- on a range of tasks and model architectures. Although the task vector is highly compressed, we find that this single vector outperforms prompting the model with the full task information, unique to this cross-modal case. Furthermore, we show that task vectors can be transferred from a base language model to its fine-tuned vision-language counterpart, and that they can be derived solely from instructions without the need for examples. Taken together, our findings shed light on how VLMs internally process task information, and how they map different modalities into common semantic representations.

<p>Abstract: CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingying Fang, Zihao Jin, Shaojie Guo, Jinda Liu, Zhiling Yue, Yijian Gao, Junzhi Ning, Zhi Li, Simon Walsh, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Pengcheng Xu, Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, Yong Liu, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Xiangtai Li, Jiangning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiting Li, Juncan Deng, Zeyu Wang, Kedong Xu, Rongtao Deng, Hong Gu, Haibin Shen, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation via Stable Diffusion models (SDM) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their computational intensity, particularly in the iterative denoising process, hinders real-time deployment in latency-sensitive applications. While Recent studies have explored post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models, existing methods often overlook the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is paramount for professional applications where both efficiency and output reliability are essential. To ensure that quantized SDM generates high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for SDM. Our framework introduces a Serial-to-Parallel pipeline that simultaneously maintains training-inference consistency and ensures optimization stability. Building upon this foundation, we further develop several techniques including multi-timestep activation quantization, time information precalculation, inter-layer distillation, and selective freezing, to achieve high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models while maintaining quantization efficiency.
  Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple Stable Diffusion variants (v1-4, v2-1, XL 1.0, and v3), our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches with shorter training times. Under W4A8 quantization settings, we achieve significant improvements in both distribution similarity and visual fidelity, while preserving a high image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Zhuoling Li, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nannan Li, Kevin J. Shih, Bryan A. Plummer</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an isolated garment image in a canonical product view and a separate image of a person, the virtual try-on task aims to generate a new image of the person wearing the target garment. Prior virtual try-on works face two major challenges in achieving this goal: a) the paired (human, garment) training data has limited availability; b) generating textures on the human that perfectly match that of the prompted garment is difficult, often resulting in distorted text and faded textures. Our work explores ways to tackle these issues through both synthetic data as well as model refinement. We introduce a garment extraction model that generates (human, synthetic garment) pairs from a single image of a clothed individual. The synthetic pairs can then be used to augment the training of virtual try-on. We also propose an Error-Aware Refinement-based Schr\"odinger Bridge (EARSB) that surgically targets localized generation errors for correcting the output of a base virtual try-on model. To identify likely errors, we propose a weakly-supervised error classifier that localizes regions for refinement, subsequently augmenting the Schr\"odinger Bridge's noise schedule with its confidence heatmap. Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode-Upper demonstrate that our synthetic data augmentation enhances the performance of prior work, while EARSB improves the overall image quality. In user studies, our model is preferred by the users in an average of 59% of cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter J. Bentley, Soo Ling Lim, Fuyuki Ishikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar H. Khater, Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui, M. Shamim Hossain, Aiman El-Maleh</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds compete for essential resources with crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision, as well as high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model that enhances weed detection performance without introducing significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset, which reflects real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance comparable to that of large models (mAP@0.5 = 95.2%), yet with significantly fewer parameters (approximately 4.21% of the parameters of YOLOv4), lower computational complexity and better computational efficiency 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). These key findings indicate EcoWeedNet's deployability on low-power consumer hardware, lower energy consumption, and hence reduced carbon footprint, thereby emphasizing the application prospects of EcoWeedNet in next-generation sustainable agriculture. These findings provide the way forward for increased application of environmentally-friendly agricultural consumer technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Enes Doruk, Hasan F. Ates</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 2D CNN-based domain adaptation approaches struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, making it difficult to adapt to target domains with significant spatial distribution changes. While transformer-based domain adaptation methods better capture distant relationships through self-attention mechanisms that facilitate more effective cross-domain feature alignment, their quadratic computational complexity makes practical deployment challenging for object detection tasks across diverse domains. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first domain-adaptive Mamba-based one-stage object detection model, termed DA-Mamba. Specifically, we combine Mamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to address domain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Our design leverages domain-adaptive spatial and channel-wise scanning within the Mamba block to extract highly transferable representations for efficient sequential processing, while cross-attention modules generate long-range, mixed-domain spatial features to enable robust soft alignment across domains. Besides, motivated by the observation that hybrid architectures introduce feature noise in domain adaptation tasks, we propose an entropy-based knowledge distillation framework with margin ReLU, which adaptively refines multi-level representations by suppressing irrelevant activations and aligning uncertainty across source and target domains. Finally, to prevent overfitting caused by the mixed-up features generated through cross-attention mechanisms, we propose entropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations that simultaneously refine target features and enhance model generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Yu, Yanlin Jin, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Akshat Dave, Guha Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal multi-view action recognition is a rapidly growing field in computer vision, offering significant potential for applications in surveillance. However, current datasets often fail to address real-world challenges such as wide-area distributed settings, asynchronous data streams, and the lack of frame-level annotations. Furthermore, existing methods face difficulties in effectively modeling inter-view relationships and enhancing spatial feature learning. In this paper, we introduce the MultiSensor-Home dataset, a novel benchmark designed for comprehensive action recognition in home environments, and also propose the Multi-modal Multi-view Transformer-based Sensor Fusion (MultiTSF) method. The proposed MultiSensor-Home dataset features untrimmed videos captured by distributed sensors, providing high-resolution RGB and audio data along with detailed multi-view frame-level action labels. The proposed MultiTSF method leverages a Transformer-based fusion mechanism to dynamically model inter-view relationships. Furthermore, the proposed method integrates a human detection module to enhance spatial feature learning, guiding the model to prioritize frames with human activity to enhance action the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the proposed MultiSensor-Home and the existing MM-Office datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiTSF over the state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing real-world multi-modal multi-view action recognition.

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary Digital Subtraction Angiography images is essential to diagnose and treat coronary artery diseases. Despite advances in deep learning, challenges such as high intra-class variance and class imbalance limit precise vessel delineation. Most existing approaches for coronary DSA segmentation cannot address these issues. Also, existing segmentation network's encoders do not directly generate semantic embeddings, which could enable the decoder to reconstruct segmentation masks effectively from these well-defined features. We propose a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss that fuses supervised and prototypical contrastive learning to enhance coronary DSA image segmentation. The supervised contrastive loss enforces semantic embeddings in the encoder, improving feature differentiation. The prototypical contrastive loss allows the model to focus on the foreground class while alleviating the high intra-class variance and class imbalance problems by concentrating only on the hard-to-classify background samples. We implement the proposed SPCL loss within an MSA-UNet3+: a Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced UNet3+ architecture. The architecture integrates key components: a Multi-Scale Attention Encoder and a Multi-Scale Dilated Bottleneck designed to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and a Contextual Attention Fusion Module built to keep fine-grained details while improving contextual understanding. Experiments on a private coronary DSA dataset show that MSA-UNet3+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest Dice coefficient and F1-score and significantly reducing ASD and ACD. The developed framework provides clinicians with precise vessel segmentation, enabling accurate identification of coronary stenosis and supporting informed diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models indirectly estimate the probability density over a data space, which can be used to study its structure. In this work, we show that geodesics can be computed in diffusion latent space, where the norm induced by the spatially-varying inner product is inversely proportional to the probability density. In this formulation, a path that traverses a high density (that is, probable) region of image latent space is shorter than the equivalent path through a low density region. We present algorithms for solving the associated initial and boundary value problems and show how to compute the probability density along the path and the geodesic distance between two points. Using these techniques, we analyze how closely video clips approximate geodesics in a pre-trained image diffusion space. Finally, we demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to training-free image sequence interpolation and extrapolation, given a pre-trained image diffusion model.</p>

<p>Abstract: LiDAR loop closure detection (LCD) is crucial for consistent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) but faces challenges in robustness and accuracy. Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition, captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH, revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM advancements.The project can be found at https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/VCBench/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangshuo Qi, Luqi Cheng, Zijie Zhou, Guangming Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchen Wu, Lu Zhang, Hang Yao, Junlong Du, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Yunsheng Wu, Xiaoqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results across various cross-modal tasks. However, hallucinations, i.e., the models generating counterfactual responses, remain a challenge. Though recent studies have attempted to alleviate object perception hallucinations, they focus on the models' response generation, and overlooking the task question itself. This paper discusses the vulnerability of LVLMs in solving counterfactual presupposition questions (CPQs), where the models are prone to accept the presuppositions of counterfactual objects and produce severe hallucinatory responses. To this end, we introduce "Antidote", a unified, synthetic data-driven post-training framework for mitigating both types of hallucination above. It leverages synthetic data to incorporate factual priors into questions to achieve self-correction, and decouple the mitigation process into a preference optimization problem. Furthermore, we construct "CP-Bench", a novel benchmark to evaluate LVLMs' ability to correctly handle CPQs and produce factual responses. Applied to the LLaVA series, Antidote can simultaneously enhance performance on CP-Bench by over 50%, POPE by 1.8-3.3%, and CHAIR & SHR by 30-50%, all without relying on external supervision from stronger LVLMs or human feedback and introducing noticeable catastrophic forgetting issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Liu, Ran Tong, Aowei Shen, Shuzheng Li, Changlin Yang, Lisha Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Memes often merge visuals with brief text to share humor or opinions, yet some memes contain harmful messages such as hate speech. In this paper, we introduces MemeBLIP2, a light weight multimodal system that detects harmful memes by combining image and text features effectively. We build on previous studies by adding modules that align image and text representations into a shared space and fuse them for better classification. Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiying Li, Xingqun Qi, Bingkun Yang, Chen Weile, Zezhao Tian, Muyi Sun, Qifeng Liu, Man Zhang, Zhenan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating responsive listener head dynamics with nuanced emotions and expressive reactions is crucial for practical dialogue modeling in various virtual avatar animations. Previous studies mainly focus on the direct short-term production of listener behavior. They overlook the fine-grained control over motion variations and emotional intensity, especially in long-sequence modeling. Moreover, the lack of long-term and large-scale paired speaker-listener corpora including head dynamics and fine-grained multi-modality annotations (e.g., text-based expression descriptions, emotional intensity) also limits the application of dialogue modeling.Therefore, we first newly collect a large-scale multi-turn dataset of 3D dyadic conversation containing more than 1.4M valid frames for multi-modal responsive interaction, dubbed ListenerX. Additionally, we propose VividListener, a novel framework enabling fine-grained, expressive and controllable listener dynamics modeling. This framework leverages multi-modal conditions as guiding principles for fostering coherent interactions between speakers and listeners.Specifically, we design the Responsive Interaction Module (RIM) to adaptively represent the multi-modal interactive embeddings. RIM ensures the listener dynamics achieve fine-grained semantic coordination with textual descriptions and adjustments, while preserving expressive reaction with speaker behavior. Meanwhile, we design the Emotional Intensity Tags (EIT) for emotion intensity editing with multi-modal information integration, applying to both text descriptions and listener motion amplitude.Extensive experiments conducted on our newly collected ListenerX dataset demonstrate that VividListener achieves state-of-the-art performance, realizing expressive and controllable listener dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Liu, Xu Zou, Gang Hua, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prompting techniques are widely used to efficiently fine-tune pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) by learning a small set of shared prompts for all tokens. However, existing methods overlook the unique roles of different tokens in conveying discriminative information and interact with all tokens using the same prompts, thereby limiting the representational capacity of ViT. This often leads to indistinguishable and biased prompt-extracted features, hindering performance. To address this issue, we propose a plug-and-play Token Coordinated Prompt Attention (TCPA) module, which assigns specific coordinated prompts to different tokens for attention-based interactions. Firstly, recognizing the distinct functions of CLS and image tokens-global information aggregation and local feature extraction, we disentangle the prompts into CLS Prompts and Image Prompts, which interact exclusively with CLS tokens and image tokens through attention mechanisms. This enhances their respective discriminative abilities. Furthermore, as different image tokens correspond to distinct image patches and contain diverse information, we employ a matching function to automatically assign coordinated prompts to individual tokens. This enables more precise attention interactions, improving the diversity and representational capacity of the extracted features. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that TCPA significantly enhances the diversity and discriminative power of the extracted features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Jintao Guo, Shanshan Zhao, Minghao Fu, Lunhao Duan, Guo-Hua Wang, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community.

<p>Abstract: Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential for studying brain development in utero. The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset. Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans. However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyang Jiang, Mengmeng Wang, Liuzhuozheng Li, Lei Zhang, Haoyu Wang, Wei Wei, Guang Dai, Yanning Zhang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation quality of the diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangming Cui, Yonggang Zhang, Xuan Wang, Xinmei Tian, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in prompt learning of large vision-language models have significantly improved performance in target-specific tasks. However, these prompt optimizing methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or generalizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that overfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge having strong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to enhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and leverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the FM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective, preserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of overfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is compatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2) the FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengli Luo, Canlong Zhang, Xiaochun Lu, Zhixin Li, Zhiwen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based pedestrian search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian in untrimmed images using natural language descriptions. However, in complex scenes with multiple pedestrians, existing methods are limited by uncertainties in detection and matching, leading to degraded performance. To address this, we propose UPD-TBPS, a novel framework comprising three modules: Multi-granularity Uncertainty Estimation (MUE), Prototype-based Uncertainty Decoupling (PUD), and Cross-modal Re-identification (ReID). MUE conducts multi-granularity queries to identify potential targets and assigns confidence scores to reduce early-stage uncertainty. PUD leverages visual context decoupling and prototype mining to extract features of the target pedestrian described in the query. It separates and learns pedestrian prototype representations at both the coarse-grained cluster level and the fine-grained individual level, thereby reducing matching uncertainty. ReID evaluates candidates with varying confidence levels, improving detection and retrieval accuracy. Experiments on CUHK-SYSU-TBPS and PRW-TBPS datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Y. B. Wang, S. Z. Zhou, J. F. Wu, T. Hu, J. N. Zhang, Y. Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose PAHA, an end-to-end audio-driven upper-body human animation framework with diffusion model. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhan Cao, Wei Sun, Kaiwei Zhang, Yicong Peng, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is essential for quantifying perceptual quality in various video processing workflows, spanning from camera capture systems to over-the-top streaming platforms. While recent supervised VQA models have made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets -- a process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has hindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content and distortions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale, unlabeled web videos. Our approach leverages a \textbf{learning-to-rank} paradigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically labeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA models and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textbf{iterative self-improvement training strategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively refine the annotation quality of training data. By training on a dataset $10\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves zero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses supervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our self-supervised approach in training generalized VQA models. The datasets and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated structures as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuou Sun, Bailin Deng, Juyong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing a freeform surface to reflect or refract light to achieve a target distribution is a challenging inverse problem. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization strategy for an optical surface mesh. Our formulation leverages a novel differentiable rendering model, and is directly driven by the difference between the resulting light distribution and the target distribution. We also enforce geometric constraints related to fabrication requirements, to facilitate CNC milling and polishing of the designed surface. To address the issue of local minima, we formulate a face-based optimal transport problem between the current mesh and the target distribution, which makes effective large changes to the surface shape. The combination of our optimal transport update and rendering-guided optimization produces an optical surface design with a resulting image closely resembling the target, while the geometric constraints in our optimization help to ensure consistency between the rendering model and the final physical results. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of target images using both simulated rendering and physical prototypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali, Marcelo Pereyra, Luke Shaw, Konstantinos Zygalakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing sensitive data, making it an attractive solution for medical imaging tasks. However, traditional FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), face difficulties in generalizing across domains due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics across institutions. This challenge is particularly evident in pancreas MRI segmentation, where anatomical variability and imaging artifacts significantly impact performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FL algorithms for pancreas MRI segmentation and introduce a novel approach that incorporates adaptive aggregation weights. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities. Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple hospitals (centers).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Makoto Fukushima, Shusuke Eshita, Hiroshige Fukuhara</p>
<p>Abstract: Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and have demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and 80 words (10 word from eight categories) in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level of 10%). Moreover, we found performance variations across word categories and colors: while LLMs tended to excel in categories such as Rhythm and Landscape, they struggled with categories such as Emotions. Interestingly, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, consistent with previous studies. Thus, despite reasonable alignment in basic color discrimination, humans and LLMs still diverge systematically in the words they assign to those colors. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, raising the possibility of systematic differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</p>

One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruslan Agishev, Karel Zimmermann</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel model for the prediction of robot trajectories on rough offroad terrain from the onboard camera images. This model enforces the laws of classical mechanics through a physics-aware neural symbolic layer while preserving the ability to learn from large-scale data as it is end-to-end differentiable. The proposed hybrid model integrates a black-box component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer. This layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real images that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning or SLAM. The codes and data are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Mathias Funk, Jindong Wang, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaidong Zhang, Rongtao Xu, Pengzhen Ren, Junfan Lin, Hefeng Wu, Liang Lin, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Wu, Wenbo Xu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Rui Yang, Shize Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyoung Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Allshire, Hongsuk Choi, Junyi Zhang, David McAllister, Anthony Zhang, Chung Min Kim, Trevor Darrell, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik, Angjoo Kanazawa</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.</p>
