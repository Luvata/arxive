<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Li, Ziyang Meng, Hongzhan Lin, Ziyang Luo, Yuchen Tian, Jing Ma, Zhiyong Huang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to significant progress in developing GUI agents for general tasks such as web browsing and mobile phone use. However, their application in professional domains remains under-explored. These specialized workflows introduce unique challenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays, smaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark comprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional domains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five industries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform poorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our experiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances accuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search method that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded search, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any additional training. We hope that our benchmark and findings will advance the development of GUI agents for professional applications.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08003">Have we unified image generation and understanding yet? An empirical study of GPT-4o&#x27;s image generation ability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Li, Jingran Zhang, Justin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: OpenAI's multimodal GPT-4o has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation and editing, yet its ability to achieve world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis--seamlessly integrating domain knowledge, contextual reasoning, and instruction adherence--remains unproven. In this study, we systematically evaluate these capabilities across three critical dimensions: (1) Global Instruction Adherence, (2) Fine-Grained Editing Precision, and (3) Post-Generation Reasoning. While existing benchmarks highlight GPT-4o's strong capabilities in image generation and editing, our evaluation reveals GPT-4o's persistent limitations: the model frequently defaults to literal interpretations of instructions, inconsistently applies knowledge constraints, and struggles with conditional reasoning tasks. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about GPT-4o's unified understanding and generation capabilities, exposing significant gaps in its dynamic knowledge integration. Our study calls for the development of more robust benchmarks and training strategies that go beyond surface-level alignment, emphasizing context-aware and reasoning-grounded multimodal generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaicheng Niu, Guohao Chen, Peilin Zhao, Tianyi Wang, Pengcheng Wu, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we seek to develop a versatile test-time adaptation (TTA) objective for a variety of tasks - classification and regression across image-, object-, and pixel-level predictions. We achieve this through a self-bootstrapping scheme that optimizes prediction consistency between the test image (as target) and its deteriorated view. The key challenge lies in devising effective augmentations/deteriorations that: i) preserve the image's geometric information, e.g., object sizes and locations, which is crucial for TTA on object/pixel-level tasks, and ii) provide sufficient learning signals for TTA. To this end, we analyze how common distribution shifts affect the image's information power across spatial frequencies in the Fourier domain, and reveal that low-frequency components carry high power and masking these components supplies more learning signals, while masking high-frequency components can not. In light of this, we randomly mask the low-frequency amplitude of an image in its Fourier domain for augmentation. Meanwhile, we also augment the image with noise injection to compensate for missing learning signals at high frequencies, by enhancing the information power there. Experiments show that, either independently or as a plug-and-play module, our method achieves superior results across classification, segmentation, and 3D monocular detection tasks with both transformer and CNN models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuseon Kim, Kyongseok Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Video prediction (VP) generates future frames by leveraging spatial representations and temporal context from past frames. Traditional recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models enhance memory cell structures to capture spatiotemporal states over extended durations but suffer from gradual loss of object appearance details. To address this issue, we propose the strong recollection VP (SRVP) model, which integrates standard attention (SA) and reinforced feature attention (RFA) modules. Both modules employ scaled dot-product attention to extract temporal context and spatial correlations, which are then fused to enhance spatiotemporal representations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SRVP mitigates image quality degradation in RNN-based models while achieving predictive performance comparable to RNN-free architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Bi, Jingjun Yi, Hao Zheng, Haolan Zhan, Wei Ji, Yawen Huang, Yuexiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization aims to learn a representation from the source domain, which can be generalized to arbitrary unseen target domains. A fundamental challenge for visual domain generalization is the domain gap caused by the dramatic style variation whereas the image content is stable. The realm of selective state space, exemplified by VMamba, demonstrates its global receptive field in representing the content. However, the way exploiting the domain-invariant property for selective state space is rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a novel Flow Factorized State Space model, dubbed as DG-Famba, for visual domain generalization. To maintain domain consistency, we innovatively map the style-augmented and the original state embeddings by flow factorization. In this latent flow space, each state embedding from a certain style is specified by a latent probability path. By aligning these probability paths in the latent space, the state embeddings are able to represent the same content distribution regardless of the style differences. Extensive experiments conducted on various visual domain generalization settings show its state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08020">Learning Fine-grained Domain Generalization via Hyperbolic State Space Hallucination</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Bi, Jingjun Yi, Haolan Zhan, Wei Ji, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) aims to learn a fine-grained representation that can be well generalized to unseen target domains when only trained on the source domain data. Compared with generic domain generalization, FGDG is particularly challenging in that the fine-grained category can be only discerned by some subtle and tiny patterns. Such patterns are particularly fragile under the cross-domain style shifts caused by illumination, color and etc. To push this frontier, this paper presents a novel Hyperbolic State Space Hallucination (HSSH) method. It consists of two key components, namely, state space hallucination (SSH) and hyperbolic manifold consistency (HMC). SSH enriches the style diversity for the state embeddings by firstly extrapolating and then hallucinating the source images. Then, the pre- and post- style hallucinate state embeddings are projected into the hyperbolic manifold. The hyperbolic state space models the high-order statistics, and allows a better discernment of the fine-grained patterns. Finally, the hyperbolic distance is minimized, so that the impact of style variation on fine-grained patterns can be eliminated. Experiments on three FGDG benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mia Chiquier, Orr Avrech, Yossi Gandelsman, Berthy Feng, Katherine Bouman, Carl Vondrick</p>
<p>Abstract: Human expertise depends on the ability to recognize subtle visual differences, such as distinguishing diseases, species, or celestial phenomena. We propose a new method to teach novices how to differentiate between nuanced categories in specialized domains. Our method uses generative models to visualize the minimal change in features to transition between classes, i.e., counterfactuals, and performs well even in domains where data is sparse, examples are unpaired, and category boundaries are not easily explained by text. By manipulating the conditioning space of diffusion models, our proposed method DIFFusion disentangles category structure from instance identity, enabling high-fidelity synthesis even in challenging domains. Experiments across six domains show accurate transitions even with limited and unpaired examples across categories. User studies confirm that our generated counterfactuals outperform unpaired examples in teaching perceptual expertise, showing the potential of generative models for specialized visual learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a new approach to anomaly detection and localization in synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR), expanding upon the existing patch distribution modeling framework (PaDiM). We introduce the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric, providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meilun Zhou, Aditya Dutt, Alina Zare</p>
<p>Abstract: Triplet loss traditionally relies only on class labels and does not use all available information in multi-task scenarios where multiple types of annotations are available. This paper introduces a Multi-Annotation Triplet Loss (MATL) framework that extends triplet loss by incorporating additional annotations, such as bounding box information, alongside class labels in the loss formulation. By using these complementary annotations, MATL improves multi-task learning for tasks requiring both classification and localization. Experiments on an aerial wildlife imagery dataset demonstrate that MATL outperforms conventional triplet loss in both classification and localization. These findings highlight the benefit of using all available annotations for triplet loss in multi-task learning frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Hu, Zhidan Zhao, Zhifeng Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic data exhibits complex temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal correlations. Most of models use either independent modules to separately extract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously extract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover, models that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from demonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations architecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure convolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and inferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency matrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as well as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph convolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local synchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of temporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range temporal correlations. Finally, through multi-view collaborative prediction module, the model integrates the gated-activated original, local synchronous joint spatial-temporal, and long-range temporal features to achieve comprehensive prediction. This study conducts extensive experiments on flow datasets (PeMS03/04/07/08) and speed dataset (PeMS-Bay), covering multiple prediction horizons. The results show that STEI-PCN demonstrates competitive computational efficiency in both training and inference speeds, and achieves superior or slightly inferior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most evaluation metrics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08072">X-DECODE: EXtreme Deblurring with Curriculum Optimization and Domain Equalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushant Gautam, Jingdao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Restoring severely blurred images remains a significant challenge in computer vision, impacting applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and photography. This paper introduces a novel training strategy based on curriculum learning to improve the robustness of deep learning models for extreme image deblurring. Unlike conventional approaches that train on only low to moderate blur levels, our method progressively increases the difficulty by introducing images with higher blur severity over time, allowing the model to adapt incrementally. Additionally, we integrate perceptual and hinge loss during training to enhance fine detail restoration and improve training stability. We experimented with various curriculum learning strategies and explored the impact of the train-test domain gap on the deblurring performance. Experimental results on the Extreme-GoPro dataset showed that our method outperforms the next best method by 14% in SSIM, whereas experiments on the Extreme-KITTI dataset showed that our method outperforms the next best by 18% in SSIM. Ablation studies showed that a linear curriculum progression outperforms step-wise, sigmoid, and exponential progressions, while hyperparameter settings such as the training blur percentage and loss function formulation all play important roles in addressing extreme blur artifacts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbang Liu, Enpei Huang, Dongxing Mao, Hui Zhang, Xinyuan Song, Yongxin Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating 3D content from single-view images is a challenging problem that has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Current approaches typically utilize score distillation sampling (SDS) from pre-trained 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view 3D representations. Although some methods have made notable progress by balancing generation speed and model quality, their performance is often limited by the visual inconsistencies of the diffusion model outputs. In this work, we propose ContrastiveGaussian, which integrates contrastive learning into the generative process. By using a perceptual loss, we effectively differentiate between positive and negative samples, leveraging the visual inconsistencies to improve 3D generation quality. To further enhance sample differentiation and improve contrastive learning, we incorporate a super-resolution model and introduce another Quantity-Aware Triplet Loss to address varying sample distributions during training. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior texture fidelity and improved geometric consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Saif Ullah Khan, Stephan Krau{\ss}, Didier Stricker</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SpineTrack, the first comprehensive dataset for 2D spine pose estimation in unconstrained settings, addressing a crucial need in sports analytics, healthcare, and realistic animation. Existing pose datasets often simplify the spine to a single rigid segment, overlooking the nuanced articulation required for accurate motion analysis. In contrast, SpineTrack annotates nine detailed spinal keypoints across two complementary subsets: a synthetic set comprising 25k annotations created using Unreal Engine with biomechanical alignment through OpenSim, and a real-world set comprising over 33k annotations curated via an active learning pipeline that iteratively refines automated annotations with human feedback. This integrated approach ensures anatomically consistent labels at scale, even for challenging, in-the-wild images. We further introduce SpinePose, extending state-of-the-art body pose estimators using knowledge distillation and an anatomical regularization strategy to jointly predict body and spine keypoints. Our experiments in both general and sports-specific contexts validate the effectiveness of SpineTrack for precise spine pose estimation, establishing a robust foundation for future research in advanced biomechanical analysis and 3D spine reconstruction in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Schouten, Mehmet Onurcan Kaya, Serge Belongie, Dim P. Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image generation, producing high-quality, realistic images from textual descriptions. Beyond generation, object-level image editing remains a challenging problem, requiring precise modifications while preserving visual coherence. Existing text-based instructional editing methods struggle with localized shape and layout transformations, often introducing unintended global changes. Image interaction-based approaches offer better accuracy but require manual human effort to provide precise guidance. To reduce this manual effort while maintaining a high image editing accuracy, in this paper, we propose POEM, a framework for Precise Object-level Editing using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). POEM leverages MLLMs to analyze instructional prompts and generate precise object masks before and after transformation, enabling fine-grained control without extensive user input. This structured reasoning stage guides the diffusion-based editing process, ensuring accurate object localization and transformation. To evaluate our approach, we introduce VOCEdits, a benchmark dataset based on PASCAL VOC 2012, augmented with instructional edit prompts, ground-truth transformations, and precise object masks. Experimental results show that POEM outperforms existing text-based image editing approaches in precision and reliability while reducing manual effort compared to interaction-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key research challenge in computer vision and machine learning with applications in many fields from quality control to radar imaging. In radar imaging, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), anomaly detection can be used for the classification, detection, and segmentation of objects of interest. However, there is no method for developing and benchmarking these methods on SAR imagery. To address this issue, we introduce SAR imagery anomaly detection (SARIAD). In conjunction with Anomalib, a deep-learning library for anomaly detection, SARIAD provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms and datasets for assessing and developing anomaly detection approaches on SAR imagery. SARIAD specifically integrates multiple SAR datasets along with tools to effectively apply various anomaly detection algorithms to SAR imagery. Several anomaly detection metrics and visualizations are available. Overall, SARIAD acts as a central package for benchmarking SAR models and datasets to allow for reproducible research in the field of anomaly detection in SAR imagery.

To address this, we introduce Gen3DEval, a novel evaluation framework that leverages vision large language models (vLLMs) specifically fine-tuned for 3D object quality assessment. Gen3DEval evaluates text fidelity, appearance, and surface quality by analyzing 3D surface normals, without requiring ground-truth comparisons, bridging the gap between automated metrics and user preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cherish Puniani, Advika Sinha, Shree Singhi, Aayan Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep-learning architectures need large amounts of data to produce state-of-the-art results. Annotating such huge datasets is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error. Recent advances in self-supervised learning allow us to train huge models without explicit annotation. Contrastive learning is a popular paradigm in self-supervised learning. Recent works like SimCLR and CLIP rely on image augmentations or directly minimizing cross-modal loss between image and text. Banani et al. (2023) propose to use language guidance to sample view pairs. They claim that language enables better conceptual similarity, eliminating the effects of visual variability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle Sullivan-Pao, Nicole Tian, Pooya Khorrami</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative AI image technologies become more widespread and advanced, there is a growing need for strong attribution models. These models are crucial for verifying the authenticity of images and identifying the architecture of their originating generative models-key to maintaining media integrity. However, attribution models struggle to generalize to unseen models, and traditional fine-tuning methods for updating these models have shown to be impractical in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoRA eXpandable Networks (LoRAX), a parameter-efficient class incremental algorithm that adapts to novel generative image models without the need for full retraining. Our approach trains an extremely parameter-efficient feature extractor per continual learning task via Low Rank Adaptation. Each task-specific feature extractor learns distinct features while only requiring a small fraction of the parameters present in the underlying feature extractor's backbone model. Our extensive experimentation shows LoRAX outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art class incremental learning algorithms on the Continual Deepfake Detection benchmark across all training scenarios and memory settings, while requiring less than 3% of the number of trainable parameters per feature extractor compared to the full-rank implementation. LoRAX code is available at: https://github.com/mit-ll/lorax_cil.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqiao Li, Jie Wei, Camille Kamga</p>
<p>Abstract: Heavy-duty trucks pose significant safety challenges due to their large size and limited maneuverability compared to passenger vehicles. A deeper understanding of truck characteristics is essential for enhancing the safety perspective of cooperative autonomous driving. Traditional LiDAR-based truck classification methods rely on extensive manual annotations, which makes them labor-intensive and costly. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets presents an opportunity to leverage their few-shot learning capabilities for truck classification. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) are primarily trained on image datasets, which makes it challenging to directly process point cloud data. This study introduces a novel framework that integrates roadside LiDAR point cloud data with VLMs to facilitate efficient and accurate truck classification, which supports cooperative and safe driving environments. This study introduces three key innovations: (1) leveraging real-world LiDAR datasets for model development, (2) designing a preprocessing pipeline to adapt point cloud data for VLM input, including point cloud registration for dense 3D rendering and mathematical morphological techniques to enhance feature representation, and (3) utilizing in-context learning with few-shot prompting to enable vehicle classification with minimally labeled training data. Experimental results demonstrate encouraging performance of this method and present its potential to reduce annotation efforts while improving classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Trivedy, Amani Almalki, Longin Jan Latecki</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an adaptation to the training of Vision Transformers (ViTs) that allows for an explicit modeling of objects during the attention computation. This is achieved by adding a new branch to selected attention layers that computes an auxiliary loss which we call the object-focused attention (OFA) loss. We restrict the attention to image patches that belong to the same object class, which allows ViTs to gain a better understanding of configural (or holistic) object shapes by focusing on intra-object patches instead of other patches such as those in the background. Our proposed inductive bias fits easily into the attention framework of transformers since it only adds an auxiliary loss over selected attention layers. Furthermore, our approach has no additional overhead during inference. We also experiment with multiscale masking to further improve the performance of our OFA model and give a path forward for self-supervised learning with our method. Our experimental results demonstrate that ViTs with OFA achieve better classification results than their base models, exhibit a stronger generalization ability to out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarially corrupted images, and learn representations based on object shapes rather than spurious correlations via general textures. For our OOD setting, we generate a novel dataset using the COCO dataset and Stable Diffusion inpainting which we plan to share with the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for accurate 3D human pose estimation in combat sports using sparse multi-camera setups. Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruineng Li, Daitao Xing, Huiming Sun, Yuanzhou Ha, Jinglin Shen, Chiuman Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-centric motion control in video generation remains a critical challenge, particularly when jointly controlling camera movements and human poses in scenarios like the iconic Grammy Glambot moment. While recent video diffusion models have made significant progress, existing approaches struggle with limited motion representations and inadequate integration of camera and human motion controls. In this work, we present TokenMotion, the first DiT-based video diffusion framework that enables fine-grained control over camera motion, human motion, and their joint interaction. We represent camera trajectories and human poses as spatio-temporal tokens to enable local control granularity. Our approach introduces a unified modeling framework utilizing a decouple-and-fuse strategy, bridged by a human-aware dynamic mask that effectively handles the spatially-and-temporally varying nature of combined motion signals. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate TokenMotion's effectiveness across both text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in human-centric motion control tasks. Our work represents a significant advancement in controllable video generation, with particular relevance for creative production applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision models are increasingly deployed in critical applications such as autonomous driving and CCTV monitoring, yet they remain susceptible to resource-consuming attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy-overloading attack that leverages vision language model (VLM) prompts to generate adversarial images targeting vision models. These images, though imperceptible to the human eye, significantly increase GPU energy consumption across various vision models, threatening the availability of these systems. Our framework, EO-VLM (Energy Overload via VLM), is model-agnostic, meaning it is not limited by the architecture or type of the target vision model. By exploiting the lack of safety filters in VLMs like DALL-E 3, we create adversarial noise images without requiring prior knowledge or internal structure of the target vision models. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 50% increase in energy consumption, revealing a critical vulnerability in current vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Liu, Yuxu Lu, Huashan Yu, Dong yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration is critical for improving the quality of degraded images, which is vital for applications like autonomous driving, security surveillance, and digital content enhancement. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific degradation scenarios, limiting their adaptability to the diverse and complex challenges in real-world environments. Moreover, real-world degradations are typically non-uniform, highlighting the need for adaptive and intelligent solutions. To address these issues, we propose a novel vision-language-guided universal restoration (VL-UR) framework. VL-UR leverages a zero-shot contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to enhance image restoration by integrating visual and semantic information. A scene classifier is introduced to adapt CLIP, generating high-quality language embeddings aligned with degraded images while predicting degraded types for complex scenarios. Extensive experiments across eleven diverse degradation settings demonstrate VL-UR's state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and adaptability. This positions VL-UR as a transformative solution for modern image restoration challenges in dynamic, real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analyzing Fast, Frequent, and Fine-grained (F$^3$) events presents a significant challenge in video analytics and multi-modal LLMs. Current methods struggle to identify events that satisfy all the F$^3$ criteria with high accuracy due to challenges such as motion blur and subtle visual discrepancies. To advance research in video understanding, we introduce F$^3$Set, a benchmark that consists of video datasets for precise F$^3$ event detection. Datasets in F$^3$Set are characterized by their extensive scale and comprehensive detail, usually encompassing over 1,000 event types with precise timestamps and supporting multi-level granularity. Currently, F$^3$Set contains several sports datasets, and this framework may be extended to other applications as well. We evaluated popular temporal action understanding methods on F$^3$Set, revealing substantial challenges for existing techniques. Additionally, we propose a new method, F$^3$ED, for F$^3$ event detections, achieving superior performance. The dataset, model, and benchmark code are available at https://github.com/F3Set/F3Set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Travis Driver, Andrew Vaughan, Yang Cheng, Adnan Ansar, John Christian, Panagiotis Tsiotras</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-based surface reconstruction and characterization is crucial for missions to small celestial bodies, as it informs mission planning, navigation, and scientific analysis. However, current state-of-the-practice methods, such as stereophotoclinometry (SPC), rely heavily on human-in-the-loop verification and high-fidelity a priori information. This paper proposes Photoclinometry-from-Motion (PhoMo), a novel framework that incorporates photoclinometry techniques into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM) system to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to improve autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies from in-situ imagery. In contrast to SPC, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead use dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun vector measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery taken by the Dawn mission to the asteroid 4 Vesta and the minor planet 1 Ceres and compared against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to an SPC solution and precise alignment to a stereophotogrammetry (SPG) solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghe Yang, Mingming Gong, Ye Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a crucial role in underwater exploration. Vision-based methods offer cost-effective solutions for localization and mapping in the absence of conventional sensors like GPS and LIDAR. However, underwater environments present significant challenges for feature extraction and matching due to image blurring and noise caused by attenuation, scattering, and the interference of \textit{marine snow}. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of the feature extraction and matching in the turbid underwater environment using the cross-modal knowledge distillation method that transfers the in-air feature extraction models to underwater settings using synthetic underwater images as the medium. We first propose a novel adaptive GAN-synthesis method to estimate water parameters and underwater noise distribution, to generate environment-specific synthetic underwater images. We then introduce a general knowledge distillation framework compatible with different teacher models. The evaluation of GAN-based synthesis highlights the significance of the new components, i.e. GAN-synthesized noise and forward scattering, in the proposed model. Additionally, the downstream application of feature extraction and matching (VSLAM) on real underwater sequences validates the effectiveness of the transferred model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sketches serve as fundamental blueprints in artistic creation because sketch editing is easier and more intuitive than pixel-level RGB image editing for painting artists, yet sketch generation remains unexplored despite advancements in generative models. We propose a novel framework CoProSketch, providing prominent controllability and details for sketch generation with diffusion models. A straightforward method is fine-tuning a pretrained image generation diffusion model with binarized sketch images. However, we find that the diffusion models fail to generate clear binary images, which makes the produced sketches chaotic. We thus propose to represent the sketches by unsigned distance field (UDF), which is continuous and can be easily decoded to sketches through a lightweight network. With CoProSketch, users generate a rough sketch from a bounding box and a text prompt. The rough sketch can be manually edited and fed back into the model for iterative refinement and will be decoded to a detailed sketch as the final result. Additionally, we curate the first large-scale text-sketch paired dataset as the training data. Experiments demonstrate superior semantic consistency and controllability over baselines, offering a practical solution for integrating user feedback into generative workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhi Lim, Chin Poo Lee, Kian Ming Lim, Kalaiarasi Sonai Muthu Anbananthen</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of multimodal data across text, tables, and images presents new challenges for developing models capable of complex cross-modal reasoning. Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on modality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual representations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Vision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that integrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence language model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse visual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need for intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively align vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for multimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific modules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal reranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative threshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question answering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the retrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA validation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8% in F1. On WebQA, it attains a QA score of 47.6, surpassing prior models such as PERQA by +3.2. These results highlight VLMT's strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and its potential to advance real-world information retrieval and question answering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Yan, Bob Zhang, Andrew Beng Jin Teoh, Lu Leng, Shuyi Li, Yuqi Wang, Ziyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Palmprint recognition techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling reliable recognition even when palmprints are captured in uncontrolled or challenging environments. However, this strength also introduces new risks, as publicly available palmprint images can be misused by adversaries for malicious activities. Despite this growing concern, research on methods to obscure or anonymize palmprints remains largely unexplored. Thus, it is essential to develop a palmprint de-identification technique capable of removing identity-revealing features while retaining the image's utility and preserving non-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse, high-quality palmprint images that conceal identity features for de-identification purposes. To ensure greater stability and controllability in the synthesis process, we incorporate a semantic-guided embedding fusion alongside a prior interpolation mechanism. We further propose the de-identification ratio, a novel metric for intuitive de-identification assessment. Extensive experiments across multiple palmprint datasets and recognition methods demonstrate that our method effectively conceals identity-related traits with significant diversity across de-identified samples. The de-identified samples preserve high visual fidelity and maintain excellent usability, achieving a balance between de-identification and retaining non-identity information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiong Li, Shulei Liu, Xingning Chen, Yisong Wu, Dong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR loop closure detection (LCD) is crucial for consistent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) but faces challenges in robustness and accuracy. Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image fusion seeks to seamlessly integrate foreground objects with background scenes, producing realistic and harmonious fused images. Unlike existing methods that directly insert objects into the background, adaptive and interactive fusion remains a challenging yet appealing task. It requires the foreground to adjust or interact with the background context, enabling more coherent integration. To address this, we propose an iterative human-in-the-loop data generation pipeline, which leverages limited initial data with diverse textual prompts to generate fusion datasets across various scenarios and interactions, including placement, holding, wearing, and style transfer. Building on this, we introduce DreamFuse, a novel approach based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, to generate consistent and harmonious fused images with both foreground and background information. DreamFuse employs a Positional Affine mechanism to inject the size and position of the foreground into the background, enabling effective foreground-background interaction through shared attention. Furthermore, we apply Localized Direct Preference Optimization guided by human feedback to refine DreamFuse, enhancing background consistency and foreground harmony. DreamFuse achieves harmonious fusion while generalizing to text-driven attribute editing of the fused results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.</p>

Existing approaches that use VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene information through geometric and visual information, overlooking the extraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding of rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and affordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an ideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective carrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these issues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically designed for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method leverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of objects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a geometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding of grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named DSM-Grounding. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current approaches in tasks like semantic segmentation and 3D Visual Grounding, particularly excelling in overall metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have deployed this method on robots to validate its effectiveness in navigation and grasping tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renda Li, Xiaohua Qi, Qiang Ling, Jun Yu, Ziyi Chen, Peng Chang, Mei HanJing Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven cospeech video generation typically involves two stages: speech-to-gesture and gesture-to-video. While significant advances have been made in speech-to-gesture generation, synthesizing natural expressions and gestures remains challenging in gesture-to-video systems. In order to improve the generation effect, previous works adopted complex input and training strategies and required a large amount of data sets for pre-training, which brought inconvenience to practical applications. We propose a simple one-stage training method and a temporal inference method based on a diffusion model to synthesize realistic and continuous gesture videos without the need for additional training of temporal modules.The entire model makes use of existing pre-trained weights, and only a few thousand frames of data are needed for each character at a time to complete fine-tuning. Built upon the video generator, we introduce a new audio-to-video pipeline to synthesize co-speech videos, using 2D human skeleton as the intermediate motion representation. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josef Bengtson, David Nilsson, Fredrik Kahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for single image novel view synthesis (NVS) can generate highly realistic and plausible images, but they are limited in the geometric consistency to the given relative poses. The generated images often show significant errors with respect to the epipolar constraints that should be fulfilled, as given by the target pose. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a methodology to improve the geometric correctness of images generated by a diffusion model for single image NVS. We formulate a loss function based on image matching and epipolar constraints, and optimize the starting noise in a diffusion sampling process such that the generated image should both be a realistic image and fulfill geometric constraints derived from the given target pose. Our method does not require training data or fine-tuning of the diffusion models, and we show that we can apply it to multiple state-of-the-art models for single image NVS. The method is evaluated on the MegaScenes dataset and we show that geometric consistency is improved compared to the baseline models while retaining the quality of the generated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Wang, Huiyu Duan, Yu Zhao, Juntong Wang, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly advanced both text-to-image (T2I) generation and image-to-text (I2T) interpretation. However, many generated images still suffer from issues related to perceptual quality and text-image alignment. Given the high cost and inefficiency of manual evaluation, an automatic metric that aligns with human preferences is desirable. To this end, we present EvalMi-50K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating large-multimodal image generation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 2,100 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, and (ii) large-scale human-preference annotations, including 100K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 50K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 50,400 images generated from 24 T2I models. Based on EvalMi-50K, we propose LMM4LMM, an LMM-based metric for evaluating large multimodal T2I generation from multiple dimensions including perception, text-image correspondence, and task-specific accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that LMM4LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvalMi-50K, and exhibits strong generalization ability on other AI-generated image evaluation benchmark datasets, manifesting the generality of both the EvalMi-50K dataset and LMM4LMM metric. Both EvalMi-50K and LMM4LMM will be released at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4LMM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Chen, Tianchen Deng, Wentao Zhao, Xiaoning Wang, Wenqian Xi, Weidong Chen, Jingchuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has begun exploring novel view synthesis (NVS) for LiDAR point clouds, aiming to generate realistic LiDAR scans from unseen viewpoints. However, most existing approaches do not reconstruct semantic labels, which are crucial for many downstream applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception. Unlike images, which benefit from powerful segmentation models, LiDAR point clouds lack such large-scale pre-trained models, making semantic annotation time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose SN-LiDAR, a method that jointly performs accurate semantic segmentation, high-quality geometric reconstruction, and realistic LiDAR synthesis. Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature representation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and leverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the current frame point cloud. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360 demonstrate the superiority of SN-LiDAR in both semantic and geometric reconstruction, effectively handling dynamic objects and large-scale scenes. Codes will be available on https://github.com/dtc111111/SN-Lidar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Fartash Faghri, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Chun-Liang Li, Ranjay Krishna, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual understanding is inherently contextual -- what we focus on in an image depends on the task at hand. For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges for interactive retrieval systems, as conventional methods struggle to process extensive video content efficiently. Existing approaches often rely on single models, inefficient storage, unstable temporal search, and context-agnostic reranking, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a novel framework to enhance interactive video retrieval through four key innovations: (1) an ensemble search strategy that integrates coarse-grained (CLIP) and fine-grained (BEIT3) models to improve retrieval accuracy, (2) a storage optimization technique that reduces redundancy by selecting representative keyframes via TransNetV2 and deduplication, (3) a temporal search mechanism that localizes video segments using dual queries for start and end points, and (4) a temporal reranking approach that leverages neighboring frame context to stabilize rankings. Evaluated on known-item search and question-answering tasks, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements in retrieval precision, efficiency, and user interpretability, offering a robust solution for real-world interactive video retrieval applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junliang Guo, Yang Ye, Tianyu He, Haoyu Wu, Yushu Jiang, Tim Pearce, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: World modeling is a crucial task for enabling intelligent agents to effectively interact with humans and operate in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose MineWorld, a real-time interactive world model on Minecraft, an open-ended sandbox game which has been utilized as a common testbed for world modeling. MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive Transformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input, and generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by transforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an image tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model input with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is then trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game states as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In inference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the spatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in different scales generate $4$ to $7$ frames per second and enabling real-time interactions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess not only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating new scenes, which is crucial for a world model. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the efficacy of MineWorld, outperforming SoTA open-sourced diffusion based world models significantly. The code and model have been released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lan, Zhibiao Wang, Haoyang Yu, Ye Tao, Wenhua Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Fire detection algorithms, particularly those based on computer vision, encounter significant challenges such as high computational costs and delayed response times, which hinder their application in real-time systems. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Light-YOLOv8-Flame, a lightweight flame detection algorithm specifically designed for fast and efficient real-time deployment. The proposed model enhances the YOLOv8 architecture through the substitution of the original C2f module with the FasterNet Block module. This new block combines Partial Convolution (PConv) and Convolution (Conv) layers, reducing both computational complexity and model size. A dataset comprising 7,431 images, representing both flame and non-flame scenarios, was collected and augmented for training purposes. Experimental findings indicate that the modified YOLOv8 model achieves a 0.78% gain in mean average precision (mAP) and a 2.05% boost in recall, while reducing the parameter count by 25.34%, with only a marginal decrease in precision by 0.82%. These findings highlight that Light-YOLOv8-Flame offers enhanced detection performance and speed, making it well-suited for real-time fire detection on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reflective and textureless surfaces remain a challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction.Both camera pose calibration and shape reconstruction often fail due to insufficient or unreliable cross-view visual features. To address these issues, we present PMNI (Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration), a neural surface reconstruction method that incorporates rich geometric information by leveraging surface normal maps instead of RGB images. By enforcing geometric constraints from surface normals and multi-view shape consistency within a neural signed distance function (SDF) optimization framework, PMNI simultaneously recovers accurate camera poses and high-fidelity surface geometry. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of reflective surfaces, even without reliable initial camera poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Zhou, Suzhi Gang, Decheng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Malicious applications of visual manipulation have raised serious threats to the security and reputation of users in many fields. To alleviate these issues, adversarial noise-based defenses have been enthusiastically studied in recent years. However, ``data-only" methods tend to distort fake samples in the low-level feature space rather than the high-level semantic space, leading to limitations in resisting malicious manipulation. Frontier research has shown that integrating knowledge in deep learning can produce reliable and generalizable solutions. Inspired by these, we propose a knowledge-guided adversarial defense (KGAD) to actively force malicious manipulation models to output semantically confusing samples. Specifically, in the process of generating adversarial noise, we focus on constructing significant semantic confusions at the domain-specific knowledge level, and exploit a metric closely related to visual perception to replace the general pixel-wise metrics. The generated adversarial noise can actively interfere with the malicious manipulation model by triggering knowledge-guided and perception-related disruptions in the fake samples. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on human perception and visual quality assessment. The results on two different tasks both show that our defense provides better protection compared to state-of-the-art methods and achieves great generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Qi, Jianqin Yin, Meng Chen, Yingchun Niu, Yuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing class-incremental learning methods in 3D point clouds rely on exemplars (samples of former classes) to resist the catastrophic forgetting of models, and exemplar-free settings will greatly degrade the performance. For exemplar-free incremental learning, the pre-trained model methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in 2D domains. However, these methods cannot be migrated to the 3D domains due to the limited pre-training datasets and insufficient focus on fine-grained geometric details. This paper breaks through these limitations, proposing a basic shape dataset with zero collection cost for model pre-training. It helps a model obtain extensive knowledge of 3D geometries. Based on this, we propose a framework embedded with 3D geometry knowledge for incremental learning in point clouds, compatible with exemplar-free (-based) settings. In the incremental stage, the geometry knowledge is extended to represent objects in point clouds. The class prototype is calculated by regularizing the data representation with the same category and is kept adjusting in the learning process. It helps the model remember the shape features of different categories. Experiments show that our method outperforms other baseline methods by a large margin on various benchmark datasets, considering both exemplar-free (-based) settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-point class incremental learning helps the 3D-points-vision robots continually learn category knowledge from 2D images, improving their perceptual capability in dynamic environments. However, some incremental learning methods address unimodal forgetting but fail in cross-modal cases, while others handle modal differences within training/testing datasets but assume no modal gaps between them. We first explore this cross-modal task, proposing a benchmark CMIP-CIL and relieving the cross-modal catastrophic forgetting problem. It employs masked point clouds and rendered multi-view images within a contrastive learning framework in pre-training, empowering the vision model with the generalizations of image-point correspondence. In the incremental stage, by freezing the backbone and promoting object representations close to their respective prototypes, the model effectively retains and generalizes knowledge across previously seen categories while continuing to learn new ones. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the benchmark datasets. Experiments prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the baseline methods by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work focuses on tracking and understanding human motion using consumer wearable devices, such as VR/AR headsets, smart glasses, cellphones, and smartwatches. These devices provide diverse, multi-modal sensor inputs, including egocentric images, and 1-3 sparse IMU sensors in varied combinations. Motion descriptions can also accompany these signals. The diverse input modalities and their intermittent availability pose challenges for consistent motion capture and understanding. In this work, we present Ego4o (o for omni), a new framework for simultaneous human motion capture and understanding from multi-modal egocentric inputs. This method maintains performance with partial inputs while achieving better results when multiple modalities are combined. First, the IMU sensor inputs, the optional egocentric image, and text description of human motion are encoded into the latent space of a motion VQ-VAE. Next, the latent vectors are sent to the VQ-VAE decoder and optimized to track human motion. When motion descriptions are unavailable, the latent vectors can be input into a multi-modal LLM to generate human motion descriptions, which can further enhance motion capture accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting accurate human motion and high-quality motion descriptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in visual synthesis have leveraged diffusion models and attention mechanisms to achieve high-fidelity artistic style transfer and photorealistic text-to-image generation. However, real-time deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. We propose Muon-AD, a co-designed framework that integrates the Muon optimizer with attention distillation for real-time edge synthesis. By eliminating gradient conflicts through orthogonal parameter updates and dynamic pruning, Muon-AD achieves 3.2 times faster convergence compared to Stable Diffusion-TensorRT, while maintaining synthesis quality (15% lower FID, 4% higher SSIM). Our framework reduces peak memory to 7GB on Jetson Orin and enables 24FPS real-time generation through mixed-precision quantization and curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff and ImageNet-Texture demonstrate Muon-AD's Pareto-optimal efficiency-quality trade-offs. Here, we show a 65% reduction in communication overhead during distributed training and real-time 10s/image generation on edge GPUs. These advancements pave the way for democratizing high-quality visual synthesis in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bram Vanherle, Brent Zoomers, Jeroen Put, Frank Van Reeth, Nick Michiels</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating synthetic images is a useful method for cheaply obtaining labeled data for training computer vision models. However, obtaining accurate 3D models of relevant objects is necessary, and the resulting images often have a gap in realism due to challenges in simulating lighting effects and camera artifacts. We propose using the novel view synthesis method called Gaussian Splatting to address these challenges. We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose. We introduce a novel dataset to validate our approach and show superior performance over other data generation approaches, such as Cut-and-Paste and Diffusion model-based generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kerol Djoumessi, Samuel Ofosu Mensah, Philipp Berens</p>
<p>Abstract: In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid CNN-ViT models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for medical image classification. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the model's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical image classification tasks using color fundus images. Our model not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to both black-box and interpretable models but also provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tommaso Galliena, Tommaso Apicella, Stefano Rosa, Pietro Morerio, Alessio Del Bue, Lorenzo Natale</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a self-supervised method to improve an agent's abilities in describing arbitrary objects while actively exploring a generic environment. This is a challenging problem, as current models struggle to obtain coherent image captions due to different camera viewpoints and clutter. We propose a three-phase framework to fine-tune existing captioning models that enhances caption accuracy and consistency across views via a consensus mechanism. First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\"org Gamerdinger, Sven Teufel, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate lane detection is essential for automated driving, enabling safe and reliable vehicle navigation in a variety of road scenarios. Numerous datasets have been introduced to support the development and evaluation of lane detection algorithms, each differing in terms of the amount of data, sensor types, annotation granularity, environmental conditions, and scenario diversity. This paper provides a comprehensive review of over 30 publicly available lane detection datasets, systematically analysing their characteristics, advantages and limitations. We classify these datasets based on key factors such as sensor resolution, annotation types and diversity of road and weather conditions. By identifying existing challenges and research gaps, we highlight opportunities for future dataset improvements that can further drive innovation in robust lane detection. This survey serves as a resource for researchers seeking appropriate datasets for lane detection, and contributes to the broader goal of advancing autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Cheng, Qide Dong, Liang Peng, Zhizhou Sha, Weiguo Feng, Jinghui Xie, Zhao Song, Shilei Wen, Xiaofei He, Boxi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which aligns models with human preferences through win/lose data pairs, has achieved remarkable success in language and image generation. However, applying DPO to video diffusion models faces critical challenges: (1) Data inefficiency. Generating thousands of videos per DPO iteration incurs prohibitive costs; (2) Evaluation uncertainty. Human annotations suffer from subjective bias, and automated discriminators fail to detect subtle temporal artifacts like flickering or motion incoherence. To address these, we propose a discriminator-free video DPO framework that: (1) Uses original real videos as win cases and their edited versions (e.g., reversed, shuffled, or noise-corrupted clips) as lose cases; (2) Trains video diffusion models to distinguish and avoid artifacts introduced by editing. This approach eliminates the need for costly synthetic video comparisons, provides unambiguous quality signals, and enables unlimited training data expansion through simple editing operations. We theoretically prove the framework's effectiveness even when real videos and model-generated videos follow different distributions. Experiments on CogVideoX demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Fathalizadeh, Roozbeh Razavi-Far</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual generalized category discovery has been introduced and studied in the literature as a method that aims to continuously discover and learn novel categories in incoming data batches while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned categories. A key component in addressing this challenge is the model's ability to separate novel samples, where Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has been effectively employed. In this work, we propose a novel method that integrates EVT with proxy anchors to define boundaries around proxies using a probability of inclusion function, enabling the rejection of unknown samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel EVT-based loss function to enhance the learned representation, achieving superior performance compared to other deep-metric learning methods in similar settings. Using the derived probability functions, novel samples are effectively separated from previously known categories. However, category discovery within these novel samples can sometimes overestimate the number of new categories. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel EVT-based approach to reduce the model size and discard redundant proxies. We also incorporate experience replay and knowledge distillation mechanisms during the continual learning stage to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in continual generalized category discovery scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Sabry, Gregory Schroeder, Joshua Varughese, Cristina Olaverri-Monreal</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancement of images from RGB cameras is of particular interest due to its wide range of ever-increasing applications such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, automated driving, etc. In autonomous driving, various techniques are used to enhance image quality under challenging lighting conditions. These include artificial augmentation to improve visibility in poor nighttime conditions, illumination-invariant imaging to reduce the impact of lighting variations, and shadow mitigation to ensure consistent image clarity in bright daylight. This paper proposes a pipeline for Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability in images for automated driving applications while preserving color and texture details. The Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability pipeline is compared to the widely used CLAHE technique and evaluated based on illumination uniformity and visual perception quality metrics. The results also demonstrate a significant improvement over CLAHE, enhancing a YOLO-based drivable area segmentation algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Chuquimarca, Boris Vintimilla, Sergio Velastin</p>
<p>Abstract: The level of ripeness is essential in determining the quality of bananas. To correctly estimate banana maturity, the metrics of international marketing standards need to be considered. However, the process of assessing the maturity of bananas at an industrial level is still carried out using manual methods. The use of CNN models is an attractive tool to solve the problem, but there is a limitation regarding the availability of sufficient data to train these models reliably. On the other hand, in the state-of-the-art, existing CNN models and the available data have reported that the accuracy results are acceptable in identifying banana maturity. For this reason, this work presents the generation of a robust dataset that combines real and synthetic data for different levels of banana ripeness. In addition, it proposes a simple CNN architecture, which is trained with synthetic data and using the transfer learning technique, the model is improved to classify real data, managing to determine the level of maturity of the banana. The proposed CNN model is evaluated with several architectures, then hyper-parameter configurations are varied, and optimizers are used. The results show that the proposed CNN model reaches a high accuracy of 0.917 and a fast execution time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Santos-Villafranca, Dustin Carri\'on-Ojeda, Alejandro Perez-Yus, Jesus Bermudez-Cameo, Jose J. Guerrero, Simone Schaub-Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Action recognition is an essential task in egocentric vision due to its wide range of applications across many fields. While deep learning methods have been proposed to address this task, most rely on a single modality, typically video. However, including additional modalities may improve the robustness of the approaches to common issues in egocentric videos, such as blurriness and occlusions. Recent efforts in multimodal egocentric action recognition often assume the availability of all modalities, leading to failures or performance drops when any modality is missing. To address this, we introduce an efficient multimodal knowledge distillation approach for egocentric action recognition that is robust to missing modalities (KARMMA) while still benefiting when multiple modalities are available. Our method focuses on resource-efficient development by leveraging pre-trained models as unimodal feature extractors in our teacher model, which distills knowledge into a much smaller and faster student model. Experiments on the Epic-Kitchens and Something-Something datasets demonstrate that our student model effectively handles missing modalities while reducing its accuracy drop in this scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tan, Yuzhou Ji, He Zhu, Yuan Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The semantically interactive radiance field has long been a promising backbone for 3D real-world applications, such as embodied AI to achieve scene understanding and manipulation. However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahshad Lotfinia, Arash Tayebiarasteh, Samaneh Samiei, Mehdi Joodaki, Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image analysis often depend on large and diverse labeled datasets. Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Cimarelli, Jose Andres Millan-Romera, Holger Voos, Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic, or event, cameras represent a transformation in the classical approach to visual sensing encodes detected instantaneous per-pixel illumination changes into an asynchronous stream of event packets. Their novelty compared to standard cameras lies in the transition from capturing full picture frames at fixed time intervals to a sparse data format which, with its distinctive qualities, offers potential improvements in various applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of reinventing algorithmic procedures or adapting them to effectively process the new data format.
  In this survey, we systematically examine neuromorphic vision along three main dimensions. First, we highlight the technological evolution and distinctive hardware features of neuromorphic cameras from their inception to recent models. Second, we review image processing algorithms developed explicitly for event-based data, covering key works on feature detection, tracking, and optical flow -which form the basis for analyzing image elements and transformations -as well as depth and pose estimation or object recognition, which interpret more complex scene structures and components. These techniques, drawn from classical computer vision and modern data-driven approaches, are examined to illustrate the breadth of applications for event-based cameras. Third, we present practical application case studies demonstrating how event cameras have been successfully used across various industries and scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges limiting widespread adoption, identify significant research gaps compared to standard imaging techniques, and outline promising future directions and opportunities that neuromorphic vision offers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongsheng Yu, Haitian Zheng, Zhifei Zhang, Jianming Zhang, Yuqian Zhou, Connelly Barnes, Yuchen Liu, Wei Xiong, Zhe Lin, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in generative models has significantly improved image restoration capabilities, particularly through powerful diffusion models that offer remarkable recovery of semantic details and local fidelity. However, deploying these models at ultra-high resolutions faces a critical trade-off between quality and efficiency due to the computational demands of long-range attention mechanisms. To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gesina Schwalbe, Georgii Mikriukov, Edgar Heinert, Stavros Gerolymatos, Mert Keser, Alois Knoll, Matthias Rottmann, Annika M\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: The thriving research field of concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) investigates how human-interpretable semantic concepts embed in the latent spaces of deep neural networks (DNNs). Post-hoc approaches therein use a set of examples to specify a concept, and determine its embeddings in DNN latent space using data driven techniques. This proved useful to uncover biases between different target (foreground or concept) classes. However, given that the background is mostly uncontrolled during training, an important question has been left unattended so far: Are/to what extent are state-of-the-art, data-driven post-hoc C-XAI approaches themselves prone to biases with respect to their backgrounds? E.g., wild animals mostly occur against vegetation backgrounds, and they seldom appear on roads. Even simple and robust C-XAI methods might abuse this shortcut for enhanced performance. A dangerous performance degradation of the concept-corner cases of animals on the road could thus remain undiscovered. This work validates and thoroughly confirms that established Net2Vec-based concept segmentation techniques frequently capture background biases, including alarming ones, such as underperformance on road scenes. For the analysis, we compare 3 established techniques from the domain of background randomization on >50 concepts from 2 datasets, and 7 diverse DNN architectures. Our results indicate that even low-cost setups can provide both valuable insight and improved background robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Abbas Hedjazi, Oussama Hadjerci, Adel Hafiane</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning empowers models to learn from a continuous stream of data while preserving previously acquired knowledge, effectively addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates adapters within the self-attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers to enhance knowledge retention when sequentially adding datasets from different domains. Unlike previous methods that continue learning with only one dataset, our approach introduces domain-specific output heads and feature gating, allowing the model to maintain high accuracy on previously learned tasks while incorporating only the essential information from multiple domains. The proposed method is compared to prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in the current state of the art. The results provide evidence that our method effectively alleviates the limitations of previous works. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis using three datasets, CIFAR-100, Flowers102, and DTD, each representing a distinct domain, to investigate the impact of task order on model performance. Our findings underscore the critical role of dataset sequencing in shaping learning outcomes, demonstrating that strategic ordering can significantly improve the model's ability to adapt to evolving data distributions over time while preserving the integrity of previously learned knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Kang, Xuanshuo Fu, Lluis Gomez, Alicia Forn\'es, Ernest Valveny, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is essential for document analysis and digitization. However, handwritten data often contains user-identifiable information, such as unique handwriting styles and personal lexicon choices, which can compromise privacy and erode trust in AI services. Legislation like the ``right to be forgotten'' underscores the necessity for methods that can expunge sensitive information from trained models. Machine unlearning addresses this by selectively removing specific data from models without necessitating complete retraining. Yet, it frequently encounters a privacy-accuracy tradeoff, where safeguarding privacy leads to diminished model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage unlearning strategy for a multi-head transformer-based HTR model, integrating pruning and random labeling. Our proposed method utilizes a writer classification head both as an indicator and a trigger for unlearning, while maintaining the efficacy of the recognition head. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive exploration of machine unlearning within HTR tasks. We further employ Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning user-identifiable information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves privacy while maintaining model accuracy, paving the way for new research directions in the document analysis community. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Lozupone, Alessandro Bria, Francesco Fontanella, Frederick J. A. Meijer, Claudio De Stefano, Henkjan Huisman</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a novel encoder-decoder diffusion-based framework for efficient and meaningful unsupervised learning in medical imaging, focusing on Alzheimer disease (AD) using brain MR from the ADNI database as a case study. Unlike conventional diffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion process in a compressed latent representation, improving computational efficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To validate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR associated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction while being computationally efficient. Experimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations demonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%) and age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic representations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible modifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong reconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month gap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance (SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal progression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE significantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing reconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework for scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a foundation model for medical image analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Li, Shoubin Yu, Han Lin, Jaemin Cho, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the visual quality of the generated videos. However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry still heavily relies on information stored in drawings for building construction, maintenance, compliance and error checks. However, information extraction (IE) from building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when dealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by leveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing, which can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex especially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing standards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods for this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and IE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with complex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference pipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then extract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used for drawing search, filtering and grouping. The work demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in IE for both vector (CAD) and hand-drawn (historical) drawings. A user interface (UI) that leverages the extracted metadata for drawing search is established and deployed on real projects, which demonstrates significant time savings. Additionally, an extensible domain-expert-annotated dataset for title block detection is developed, via an efficient AEC-friendly annotation workflow that lays the foundation for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Noronha, Advait Prasad Jawaji, Juan Camilo Soto, Jiajun An, Yan Gu, Upinder Kaur</p>
<p>Abstract: Animal-robot interaction (ARI) remains an unexplored challenge in robotics, as robots struggle to interpret the complex, multimodal communication cues of animals, such as body language, movement, and vocalizations. Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals. The dataset and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/RISELabPurdue/MBE-ARI/, inviting further exploration and development in this critical area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masashi Hatano, Zhifan Zhu, Hideo Saito, Dima Damen</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting hand motion and pose from an egocentric perspective is essential for understanding human intention. However, existing methods focus solely on predicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands are visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that approximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the camera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D trajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out of the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for Egocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation sequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both hands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing other joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and body joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate EgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand annotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences, respectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the baseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand pose forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokce Guven, H. Fatih Ugurdag, Hasan F. Ates</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D bone reconstruction from a single planar X-ray remains a challenge due to anatomical complexity and limited input data. We propose X2BR, a hybrid neural implicit framework that combines continuous volumetric reconstruction with template-guided non-rigid registration. The core network, X2B, employs a ConvNeXt-based encoder to extract spatial features from X-rays and predict high-fidelity 3D bone occupancy fields without relying on statistical shape models. To further refine anatomical accuracy, X2BR integrates a patient-specific template mesh, constructed using YOLOv9-based detection and the SKEL biomechanical skeleton model. The coarse reconstruction is aligned to the template using geodesic-based coherent point drift, enabling anatomically consistent 3D bone volumes. Experimental results on a clinical dataset show that X2B achieves the highest numerical accuracy, with an IoU of 0.952 and Chamfer-L1 distance of 0.005, outperforming recent baselines including X2V and D2IM-Net. Building on this, X2BR incorporates anatomical priors via YOLOv9-based bone detection and biomechanical template alignment, leading to reconstructions that, while slightly lower in IoU (0.875), offer superior anatomical realism, especially in rib curvature and vertebral alignment. This numerical accuracy vs. visual consistency trade-off between X2B and X2BR highlights the value of hybrid frameworks for clinically relevant 3D reconstructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report presents a cost-efficient strategy for training a video generation foundation model. We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08710">Hypergraph Vision Transformers: Images are More than Nodes, More than Edges</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Fixelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have highlighted the scalability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) across various tasks, yet challenges remain in balancing adaptability, computational efficiency, and the ability to model higher-order relationships. Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Gu, Jiayuan Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Images not only depict objects but also encapsulate rich interactions between them. However, generating faithful and high-fidelity images involving multiple entities interacting with each other, is a long-standing challenge. While pre-trained text-to-image models are trained on large-scale datasets to follow diverse text instructions, they struggle to generate accurate interactions, likely due to the scarcity of training data for uncommon object interactions. This paper introduces InterActing, an interaction-focused dataset with 1000 fine-grained prompts covering three key scenarios: (1) functional and action-based interactions, (2) compositional spatial relationships, and (3) multi-subject interactions. To address interaction generation challenges, we propose a decomposition-augmented refinement procedure. Our approach, DetailScribe, built on Stable Diffusion 3.5, leverages LLMs to decompose interactions into finer-grained concepts, uses a VLM to critique generated images, and applies targeted interventions within the diffusion process in refinement. Automatic and human evaluations show significantly improved image quality, demonstrating the potential of enhanced inference strategies. Our dataset and code are available at https://concepts-ai.com/p/detailscribe/ to facilitate future exploration of interaction-rich image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohang Jian, Jinlu Zhang, Junyi Wu, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Expressive Human Pose and Shape Estimation (EHPS) aims to jointly estimate human pose, hand gesture, and facial expression from monocular images. Existing methods predominantly rely on Transformer-based architectures, which suffer from quadratic complexity in self-attention, leading to substantial computational overhead, especially in multi-person scenarios. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers due to its efficient global modeling capability. However, it remains limited in capturing fine-grained local dependencies, which are essential for precise EHPS. To address these issues, we propose EMO-X, the Efficient Multi-person One-stage model for multi-person EHPS. Specifically, we explore a Scan-based Global-Local Decoder (SGLD) that integrates global context with skeleton-aware local features to iteratively enhance human tokens. Our EMO-X leverages the superior global modeling capability of Mamba and designs a local bidirectional scan mechanism for skeleton-aware local refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-X strikes an excellent balance between efficiency and accuracy. Notably, it achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, requiring 69.8% less inference time compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while outperforming most of them in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Deng, Songyou Peng, Kyle Genova, Gordon Wetzstein, Noah Snavely, Leonidas Guibas, Thomas Funkhouser</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a system using Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to analyze a large database with tens of millions of images captured at different times, with the aim of discovering patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonia Joseph, Praneet Suresh, Ethan Goldfarb, Lorenz Hufe, Yossi Gandelsman, Robert Graham, Danilo Bzdok, Wojciech Samek, Blake Aaron Richards</p>
<p>Abstract: While vision models are highly capable, their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood -- a challenge which sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have helped address in language, but which remains underexplored in vision. We address this gap by training SAEs on CLIP's vision transformer and uncover key differences between vision and language processing, including distinct sparsity patterns for SAEs trained across layers and token types. We then provide the first systematic analysis on the steerability of CLIP's vision transformer by introducing metrics to quantify how precisely SAE features can be steered to affect the model's output. We find that 10-15\% of neurons and features are steerable, with SAEs providing thousands more steerable features than the base model. Through targeted suppression of SAE features, we then demonstrate improved performance on three vision disentanglement tasks (CelebA, Waterbirds, and typographic attacks), finding optimal disentanglement in middle model layers, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on defense against typographic attacks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08736">GigaTok: Scaling Visual Tokenizers to 3 Billion Parameters for Autoregressive Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Xiong, Jun Hao Liew, Zilong Huang, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</p>

The proposed accelerator features flexible dataflow, enabling high utilization for irregular and variable tensor shapes during the LoRA process. Experimental results show up to 1.81x training speedup and 5.50x energy efficiency improvements compared to the baseline, with minimal impact on image generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: According to the National Rosacea Society, approximately sixteen million Americans suffer from rosacea, a common skin condition that causes flushing or long-term redness on a person's face. To increase rosacea awareness and to better assist physicians to make diagnosis on this disease, we propose an interpretable automatic rosacea detection method based on whitened cosine similarity in this paper. The contributions of the proposed methods are three-fold. First, the proposed method can automatically distinguish patients suffering from rosacea from people who are clean of this disease with a significantly higher accuracy than other methods in unseen test data, including both classical deep learning and statistical methods. Second, the proposed method addresses the interpretability issue by measuring the similarity between the test sample and the means of two classes, namely the rosacea class versus the normal class, which allows both medical professionals and patients to understand and trust the results. And finally, the proposed methods will not only help increase awareness of rosacea in the general population, but will also help remind patients who suffer from this disease of possible early treatment, as rosacea is more treatable in its early stages.

<p>Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in zero-shot segmentation for natural images but struggle with medical image segmentation due to differences in texture, contrast, and noise. Annotating medical images is costly and requires domain expertise, limiting large-scale annotated data availability. To address this, we propose SynthFM, a synthetic data generation framework that mimics the complexities of medical images, enabling foundation models to adapt without real medical data. Using SAM's pretrained encoder and training the decoder from scratch on SynthFM's dataset, we evaluated our method on 11 anatomical structures across 9 datasets (CT, MRI, and Ultrasound). SynthFM outperformed zero-shot baselines like SAM and MedSAM, achieving superior results under different prompt settings and on out-of-distribution datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images is fundamental to applications like virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sauradip Nag, Daniel Cohen-Or, Hao Zhang, Ali Mahdavi-Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images capturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user study, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafan Lu, Dongcheng Hu, Yitian Ye, Anqi Liu, Zixian Zhang, Xin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor poultry farms require inspection robots to maintain precise environmental control, which is crucial for preventing the rapid spread of disease and large-scale bird mortality. However, the complex conditions within these facilities, characterized by areas of intense illumination and water accumulation, pose significant challenges. Traditional navigation methods that rely on a single sensor often perform poorly in such environments, resulting in issues like laser drift and inaccuracies in visual navigation line extraction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite navigation method that integrates both laser and vision technologies. This approach dynamically computes a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensor modality, thereby eliminating the need for physical navigation lines. Experimental validation in actual poultry house environments demonstrates that our method not only resolves the inherent drawbacks of single-sensor systems, but also significantly enhances navigation precision and operational efficiency. As such, it presents a promising solution for improving the performance of inspection robots in complex indoor poultry farming settings.</p>

A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released at https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/ and we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Espinosa, Valerio Marsocci, Yuru Jia, Elliot J. Crowley, Mikolaj Czerkawski</p>
<p>Abstract: In remote sensing, multi-modal data from various sensors capturing the same scene offers rich opportunities, but learning a unified representation across these modalities remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have often been limited to single or dual-modality approaches. In this paper, we introduce COP-GEN-Beta, a generative diffusion model trained on optical, radar, and elevation data from the Major TOM dataset. What sets COP-GEN-Beta apart is its ability to map any subset of modalities to any other, enabling zero-shot modality translation after training. This is achieved through a sequence-based diffusion transformer, where each modality is controlled by its own timestep embedding. We extensively evaluate COP-GEN-Beta on thumbnail images from the Major TOM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality samples. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the model's performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful pre-trained model for future remote sensing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebasti\'an Barbas Laina, Simon Boche, Sotiris Papatheodorou, Simon Schaefer, Jaehyung Jung, Stefan Leutenegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometrically accurate and semantically expressive map representations have proven invaluable to facilitate robust and safe mobile robot navigation and task planning. Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08626">Task-conditioned Ensemble of Expert Models for Continuous Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Renu Sharma, Debasmita Pal, Arun Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the major challenges in machine learning is maintaining the accuracy of the deployed model (e.g., a classifier) in a non-stationary environment. The non-stationary environment results in distribution shifts and, consequently, a degradation in accuracy. Continuous learning of the deployed model with new data could be one remedy. However, the question arises as to how we should update the model with new training data so that it retains its accuracy on the old data while adapting to the new data. In this work, we propose a task-conditioned ensemble of models to maintain the performance of the existing model. The method involves an ensemble of expert models based on task membership information. The in-domain models-based on the local outlier concept (different from the expert models) provide task membership information dynamically at run-time to each probe sample. To evaluate the proposed method, we experiment with three setups: the first represents distribution shift between tasks (LivDet-Iris-2017), the second represents distribution shift both between and within tasks (LivDet-Iris-2020), and the third represents disjoint distribution between tasks (Split MNIST). The experiments highlight the benefits of the proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/iPRoBe-lab/Continuous_Learning_FE_DM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An D. Le, Duy A. Pham, Dong T. Pham, Hien B. Vo</p>
<p>Abstract: Fruit flies are one of the most harmful insect species to fruit yields. In AlertTrap, implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) architecture with different state-of-the-art backbone feature extractors such as MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 appears to be potential solutions for the real-time detection problem. SSD-MobileNetV1 and SSD-MobileNetV2 perform well and result in AP at 0.5 of 0.957 and 1.0, respectively. You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4-tiny outperforms the SSD family with 1.0 in AP at 0.5; however, its throughput velocity is considerably slower, which shows SSD models are better candidates for real-time implementation. We also tested the models with synthetic test sets simulating expected environmental disturbances. The YOLOv4-tiny had better tolerance to these disturbances than the SSD models. The Raspberry Pi system successfully gathered environmental data and pest counts, sending them via email over 4 G. However, running the full YOLO version in real time on Raspberry Pi is not feasible, indicating the need for a lighter object detection algorithm for future research. Among model candidates, YOLOv4-tiny generally performs best, with SSD-MobileNetV2 also comparable and sometimes better, especially in scenarios with synthetic disturbances. SSD models excel in processing time, enabling real-time, high-accuracy detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxuan You, Zhecan Wang, Rui Sun, Long Chen, Gengyu Wang, Hammad A. Ayyubi, Kai-Wei Chang, Shih-Fu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of vision-and-language (VL) understanding has made unprecedented progress with end-to-end large pre-trained VL models (VLMs). However, they still fall short in zero-shot reasoning tasks that require multi-step inferencing. To achieve this goal, previous works resort to a divide-and-conquer pipeline. In this paper, we argue that previous efforts have several inherent shortcomings: 1) They rely on domain-specific sub-question decomposing models. 2) They force models to predict the final answer even if the sub-questions or sub-answers provide insufficient information. We address these limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL reasoning using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, IdealGPT utilizes an LLM to generate sub-questions, a VLM to provide corresponding sub-answers, and another LLM to reason to achieve the final answer. These three modules perform the divide-and-conquer procedure iteratively until the model is confident about the final answer to the main question. We evaluate IdealGPT on multiple challenging VL reasoning tasks under a zero-shot setting. In particular, our IdealGPT outperforms the best existing GPT-4-like models by an absolute 10% on VCR and 15% on SNLI-VE. Code is available at https://github.com/Hxyou/IdealGPT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Luo, Fang-Yi Liang, Jiale Liu, Yu-Wei Zhan, Zhen-Duo Chen, Xin-Shun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As Web technology continues to develop, it has become increasingly common to use data stored on different clients. At the same time, federated learning has received widespread attention due to its ability to protect data privacy when let models learn from data which is distributed across various clients. However, most existing works assume that the client's data are fixed. In real-world scenarios, such an assumption is most likely not true as data may be continuously generated and new classes may also appear. To this end, we focus on the practical and challenging federated class-incremental learning (FCIL) problem. For FCIL, the local and global models may suffer from catastrophic forgetting on old classes caused by the arrival of new classes and the data distributions of clients are non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid).
  In this paper, we propose a novel method called Federated Class-Incremental Learning with PrompTing (FCILPT). Given the privacy and limited memory, FCILPT does not use a rehearsal-based buffer to keep exemplars of old data. We choose to use prompts to ease the catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Specifically, we encode the task-relevant and task-irrelevant knowledge into prompts, preserving the old and new knowledge of the local clients and solving the problem of catastrophic forgetting. We first sort the task information in the prompt pool in the local clients to align the task information on different clients before global aggregation. It ensures that the same task's knowledge are fully integrated, solving the problem of non-iid caused by the lack of classes among different clients in the same incremental task. Experiments on CIFAR-100, Mini-ImageNet, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that FCILPT achieves significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichao Cai, Yuhang Liu, Zhen Zhang, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have garnered considerable attention for various downstream tasks, mainly due to the remarkable generalization ability of the learned features. However, the features they learn often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin by exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, and recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like models' encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the representations learned by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state of the art in multimodal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Wang, Yuanhong Chen, Fengbei Liu, Yuyuan Liu, Davis James McCarthy, Helen Frazer, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototypical-part methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability in image recognition by linking predictions to training prototypes, thereby offering intuitive insights into their decision-making. Existing methods, which rely on a point-based learning of prototypes, typically face two critical issues: 1) the learned prototypes have limited representation power and are not suitable to detect Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs, reducing their decision trustworthiness; and 2) the necessary projection of the learned prototypes back into the space of training images causes a drastic degradation in the predictive performance. Furthermore, current prototype learning adopts an aggressive approach that considers only the most active object parts during training, while overlooking sub-salient object regions which still hold crucial classification information. In this paper, we present a new generative paradigm to learn prototype distributions, termed as Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto). The distribution of prototypes from MGProto enables both interpretable image classification and trustworthy recognition of OoD inputs. The optimisation of MGProto naturally projects the learned prototype distributions back into the training image space, thereby addressing the performance degradation caused by prototype projection. Additionally, we develop a novel and effective prototype mining strategy that considers not only the most active but also sub-salient object parts. To promote model compactness, we further propose to prune MGProto by removing prototypes with low importance priors. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art image recognition and OoD detection performances, while providing encouraging interpretability results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent surge in interest in city layout generation underscores its significance in urban planning and smart city development. The task involves procedurally or automatically generating spatial arrangements for urban elements such as roads, buildings, water, and vegetation. Previous methods, whether procedural modeling or deep learning-based approaches like VAEs and GANs, rely on complex priors, expert guidance, or initial layouts, and often lack diversity and interactivity. In this paper, we present CityGen, an end-to-end framework for infinite, diverse, and controllable city layout generation. Our framework introduces an infinite expansion module to extend local layouts to city-scale layouts and a multi-scale refinement module to upsample and refine them. We also designed a user-friendly control scheme, allowing users to guide generation through simple sketching. Additionally, we convert the 2D layout to 3D by synthesizing a height field, facilitating downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate CityGen's state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, making it suitable for a wide range of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Weixin Luo, Sixun Dong, Xiaohua Xuan, Zhengxin Li, Lin Ma, Shenghua Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the astonishing performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language comprehension and generation tasks triggered lots of exploration of using them as central controllers to build agent systems. Multiple studies focus on bridging the LLMs to external tools to extend the application scenarios. However, the current LLMs' ability to perceive tool use is limited to a single text query, which may result in ambiguity in understanding the users' real intentions. LLMs are expected to eliminate that by perceiving the information in the visual- or auditory-grounded instructions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MLLM-Tool, a system incorporating open-source LLMs and multi-modal encoders so that the learned LLMs can be conscious of multi-modal input instruction and then select the function-matched tool correctly. To facilitate the evaluation of the model's capability, we collect a dataset featuring multi-modal input tools from HuggingFace. Another essential feature of our dataset is that it also contains multiple potential choices for the same instruction due to the existence of identical functions and synonymous functions, which provides more potential solutions for the same query. The experiments reveal that our MLLM-Tool is capable of recommending appropriate tools for multi-modal instructions. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/MLLM-Tool/MLLM-Tool.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for enhancing 3D perception in autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Hu, Dan Guo, Kun Li, Zhan Si, Xun Yang, Xiaojun Chang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the activity-silent and persistent activity mechanisms in human visual perception biology, we design a Unified Static and Dynamic Network (UniSDNet), to learn the semantic association between the video and text/audio queries in a cross-modal environment for efficient video grounding. For static modeling, we devise a novel residual structure (ResMLP) to boost the global comprehensive interaction between the video segments and queries, achieving more effective semantic enhancement/supplement. For dynamic modeling, we effectively exploit three characteristics of the persistent activity mechanism in our network design for a better video context comprehension. Specifically, we construct a diffusely connected video clip graph on the basis of 2D sparse temporal masking to reflect the "short-term effect" relationship. We innovatively consider the temporal distance and relevance as the joint "auxiliary evidence clues" and design a multi-kernel Temporal Gaussian Filter to expand the context clue into high-dimensional space, simulating the "complex visual perception", and then conduct element level filtering convolution operations on neighbour clip nodes in message passing stage for finally generating and ranking the candidate proposals. Our UniSDNet is applicable to both Natural Language Video Grounding (NLVG) and Spoken Language Video Grounding (SLVG) tasks. Our UniSDNet achieves SOTA performance on three widely used datasets for NLVG, as well as three datasets for SLVG, e.g., reporting new records at 38.88% R@1,IoU@0.7 on ActivityNet Captions and 40.26% R@1,IoU@0.5 on TACoS. To facilitate this field, we collect two new datasets (Charades-STA Speech and TACoS Speech) for SLVG task. Meanwhile, the inference speed of our UniSDNet is 1.56$\times$ faster than the strong multi-query benchmark. Code is available at: https://github.com/xian-sh/UniSDNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous driving, particularly for the tasks of Drivable Area and Lane Segmentation, ensuring safety and navigation. To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus, a model capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNetPlus incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} to the ultra-lightweight 34K-parameter TwinLiteNetPlus_{Nano}. Notably, TwinLiteNetPlus_{Large} attains a 92.9% mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2% IoU (Intersection over Union) for Lane Segmentation. These results achieve remarkable performance, surpassing current state-of-the-art models while only requiring 11 times fewer Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for computation. Rigorously evaluated on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNetPlus demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its potential for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Size Wu, Sheng Jin, Wenwei Zhang, Lumin Xu, Wentao Liu, Wei Li, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Endowing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with visual grounding capability can significantly enhance AIs' understanding of the visual world and their interaction with humans. However, existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks, observing drastic performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue, we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention mechanism of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers, we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits, which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data, but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally, with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained, F-LMM can be directly applied to complex tasks like reasoning segmentation, grounded conversation generation and visual chain-of-thought reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Chodosh, Anish Madan, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for dynamic surface reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes from LiDAR. Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the successful development of deep image generation technology, forgery detection plays a more important role in social and economic security. Racial bias has not been explored thoroughly in the deep forgery detection field. In the paper, we first contribute a dedicated dataset called the Fair Forgery Detection (FairFD) dataset, where we prove the racial bias of public state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Different from existing forgery detection datasets, the self-constructed FairFD dataset contains a balanced racial ratio and diverse forgery generation images with the largest-scale subjects. Additionally, we identify the problems with naive fairness metrics when benchmarking forgery detection models. To comprehensively evaluate fairness, we design novel metrics including Approach Averaged Metric and Utility Regularized Metric, which can avoid deceptive results. We also present an effective and robust post-processing technique, Bias Pruning with Fair Activations (BPFA), which improves fairness without requiring retraining or weight updates. Extensive experiments conducted with 12 representative forgery detection models demonstrate the value of the proposed dataset and the reasonability of the designed fairness metrics. By applying the BPFA to the existing fairest detector, we achieve a new SOTA. Furthermore, we conduct more in-depth analyses to offer more insights to inspire researchers in the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Open-CD, a change detection toolbox that contains a rich set of change detection methods as well as related components and modules. The toolbox started from a series of open source general vision task tools, including OpenMMLab Toolkits, PyTorch Image Models, etc. It gradually evolves into a unified platform that covers many popular change detection methods and contemporary modules. It not only includes training and inference codes, but also provides some useful scripts for data analysis. We believe this toolbox is by far the most complete change detection toolbox. In this report, we introduce the various features, supported methods and applications of Open-CD. In addition, we also conduct a benchmarking study on different methods and components. We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new change detectors. Code and models are available at https://github.com/likyoo/open-cd. Pioneeringly, this report also includes brief descriptions of the algorithms supported in Open-CD, mainly contributed by their authors. We sincerely encourage researchers in this field to participate in this project and work together to create a more open community. This toolkit and report will be kept updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zou, Chenxi Du, Ajian Liu, Yuan Zhang, Jing Liu, Mingchuan Yang, Jun Wan, Hui Zhang, Zhenan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Iris recognition is widely used in high-security scenarios due to its stability and distinctiveness. However, iris images captured by different devices exhibit certain and device-related consistent differences, which has a greater impact on the classification algorithm for anti-spoofing. The iris of various races would also affect the classification, causing the risk of identity theft. So it is necessary to improve the cross-domain capabilities of the iris anti-spoofing (IAS) methods to enable it more robust in facing different races and devices. However, there is no existing protocol that is comprehensively available. To address this gap, we propose an Iris Anti-Spoofing Cross-Domain-Testing (IAS-CDT) Protocol, which involves 10 datasets, belonging to 7 databases, published by 4 institutions, and collected with 6 different devices. It contains three sub-protocols hierarchically, aimed at evaluating average performance, cross-racial generalization, and cross-device generalization of IAS models. Moreover, to address the cross-device generalization challenge brought by the IAS-CDT Protocol, we employ multiple model parameter sets to learn from the multiple sub-datasets. Specifically, we utilize the Mixture of Experts (MoE) to fit complex data distributions using multiple sub-neural networks. To further enhance the generalization capabilities, we propose a novel method Masked-MoE (MMoE), which randomly masks a portion of tokens for some experts and requires their outputs to be similar to the unmasked experts, which can effectively mitigate the overfitting issue of MoE. For the evaluation, we selected ResNet50, VIT-B/16, CLIP, and FLIP as representative models and benchmarked them under the proposed IAS-CDT Protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Liao, Sifan Wang, Ye Yuan, Riquan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an excellent solution for performing deep learning on different data owners without exchanging raw data. However, statistical heterogeneity in FL presents a key challenge, leading to a phenomenon of skewness in local model parameter distributions that researchers have largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the concept of parameter skew to describe the phenomenon that can substantially affect the accuracy of global model parameter estimation. Additionally, we introduce FedSA, an aggregation strategy to obtain a high-quality global model, to address the implication from parameter skew. Specifically, we categorize parameters into high-dispersion and low-dispersion groups based on the coefficient of variation. For high-dispersion parameters, Micro-Classes (MIC) and Macro-Classes (MAC) represent the dispersion at the micro and macro levels, respectively, forming the foundation of FedSA. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct extensive experiments with different FL algorithms on three computer vision datasets. FedSA outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines by about 4.7% in test accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqing Lin, Yuzhen Lin, Weixiang Li, Taiping Yao, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake faces poses huge potential negative impacts on our daily lives. Despite substantial advancements in deepfake detection over these years, the generalizability of existing methods against forgeries from unseen datasets or created by emerging generative models remains constrained. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach that repurposes a well-trained VLM for general deepfake detection. Motivated by the model reprogramming paradigm that manipulates the model prediction via input perturbations, our method can reprogram a pre-trained VLM model (e.g., CLIP) solely based on manipulating its input without tuning the inner parameters. First, learnable visual perturbations are used to refine feature extraction for deepfake detection. Then, we exploit information of face embedding to create sample-level adaptative text prompts, improving the performance. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that (1) the cross-dataset and cross-manipulation performances of deepfake detection can be significantly and consistently improved (e.g., over 88\% AUC in cross-dataset setting from FF++ to WildDeepfake); (2) the superior performances are achieved with fewer trainable parameters, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lifelike visualizations in design, cinematography, and gaming rely on precise physics simulations, typically requiring extensive computational resources and detailed physical input. This paper presents a method that can infer a system's physical properties from a short video, eliminating the need for explicit parameter input, provided it is close to the training condition. The learned representation is then used within a Graph Network-based Simulator to emulate the trajectories of physical systems. We demonstrate that the video-derived encodings effectively capture the physical properties of the system and showcase a linear dependence between some of the encodings and the system's motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliang Zhong, Can Wang, Jingbo Zhang, Jing Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating and inserting new objects into 3D content is a compelling approach for achieving versatile scene recreation. Existing methods, which rely on SDS optimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality results. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D content represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view diffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable video diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within MVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to enable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating the multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these sparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach yields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and produces better object quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoting Yin, Hao Shi, Yuhan Bao, Zhenshan Bing, Yiyi Liao, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving 3D reconstruction from images captured under optimal conditions has been extensively studied in the vision and imaging fields. However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient illumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in delivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a transmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras to capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction scenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected in fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework supports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast Reconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF dataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail reconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure. Furthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adonisz Dimitriu, Tam\'as Michaletzky, Viktor Remeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks threaten the reliability of machine learning models in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and defense systems. As object detectors become more robust with models like YOLOv8, developing effective adversarial methodologies is increasingly challenging. We present Truck Adversarial Camouflage Optimization (TACO), a novel framework that generates adversarial camouflage patterns on 3D vehicle models to deceive state-of-the-art object detectors. Adopting Unreal Engine 5, TACO integrates differentiable rendering with a Photorealistic Rendering Network to optimize adversarial textures targeted at YOLOv8. To ensure the generated textures are both effective in deceiving detectors and visually plausible, we introduce the Convolutional Smooth Loss function, a generalized smooth loss function. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TACO significantly degrades YOLOv8's detection performance, achieving an AP@0.5 of 0.0099 on unseen test data. Furthermore, these adversarial patterns exhibit strong transferability to other object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and earlier YOLO versions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Ding, Yixiong Liang, Shichao Kan, Qing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: High resolution is crucial for precise segmentation in fundus images, yet handling high-resolution inputs incurs considerable GPU memory costs, with diminishing performance gains as overhead increases. To address this issue while tackling the challenge of segmenting tiny objects, recent studies have explored local-global fusion methods. These methods preserve fine details using local regions and capture long-range context information from downscaled global images. However, the necessity of multiple forward passes inevitably incurs significant computational overhead, adversely affecting inference speed. In this paper, we propose HRDecoder, a simple High-Resolution Decoder network for fundus lesion segmentation. It integrates a high-resolution representation learning module to capture fine-grained local features and a high-resolution fusion module to fuse multi-scale predictions. Our method effectively improves the overall segmentation accuracy of fundus lesions while consuming reasonable memory and computational overhead, and maintaining satisfying inference speed. Experimental results on the IDRiD and DDR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/HRDecoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream for novel view synthesis, leveraging continuous aggregations of Gaussian functions to model scene geometry. However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Koutlis, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced and poses significant threats to information integrity and trust in online multimedia. While significant progress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of audio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts or in subtle ways, presents highly challenging detection scenarios. To address these challenges, we present DiMoDif, an audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages the inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the assumption that in real samples -- in contrast to deepfakes -- visual and audio signals coincide in terms of information. DiMoDif leverages features from deep networks that specialize in visual and audio speech recognition to spot frame-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize the deepfake forgery. To this end, we devise a hierarchical cross-modal fusion network, integrating adaptive temporal alignment modules and a learned discrepancy mapping layer to explicitly model the subtle differences between visual and audio representations. Then, the detection model is optimized through a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and fake intervals localization. DiMoDif outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Deepfake Detection task by 30.5 AUC on the highly challenging AV-Deepfake1M, while it performs exceptionally on FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF. On the Temporal Forgery Localization task, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 47.88 AP@0.75 on AV-Deepfake1M, and performs on-par on LAV-DF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Francois Bremond, Nicu Sebe, Shiliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Regular unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (ReID) focuses on adapting a model from a source domain to a fixed target domain. However, an adapted ReID model can hardly retain previously-acquired knowledge and generalize to unseen data. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Joint Adaptation and Anti-forgetting (DJAA) framework, which incrementally adapts a model to new domains without forgetting source domain and each adapted target domain. We explore the possibility of using prototype and instance-level consistency to mitigate the forgetting during the adaptation. Specifically, we store a small number of representative image samples and corresponding cluster prototypes in a memory buffer, which is updated at each adaptation step. With the buffered images and prototypes, we regularize the image-to-image similarity and image-to-prototype similarity to rehearse old knowledge. After the multi-step adaptation, the model is tested on all seen domains and several unseen domains to validate the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the anti-forgetting, generalization and backward-compatible ability of an unsupervised person ReID model.</p>

<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent advances in lane segment perception provide autonomous vehicles with a comprehensive understanding of driving scenarios. Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> MinKyu Lee, Sangeek Hyun, Woojin Jun, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: This work tackles the fidelity objective in the perceptual super-resolution~(SR). Specifically, we address the shortcomings of pixel-level $L_\text{p}$ loss ($\mathcal{L}_\text{pix}$) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since $L_\text{pix}$ is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality, prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However, this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly, we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of $L_\text{pix}$ that contributes to blurring, and 2) only guiding based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that they can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner, with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained with $L_\text{pix}$. Accordingly, we propose the Auto-Encoded Supervision for Optimal Penalization loss ($L_\text{AESOP}$), a novel loss function that measures distance in the AE space, instead of the raw pixel space. Note that the AE space indicates the space after the decoder, not the bottleneck. By simply substituting $L_\text{pix}$ with $L_\text{AESOP}$, we can provide effective reconstruction guidance without compromising perceptual quality. Designed for simplicity, our method enables easy integration into existing SR frameworks. Experimental results verify that AESOP can lead to favorable results in the perceptual SR task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Wu, Yi Jiang, Chuofan Ma, Yuliang Liu, Hengshuang Zhao, Zehuan Yuan, Song Bai, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Zhou, Fereshteh Shakeri, Aymen Sadraoui, Mounir Kaaniche, Jean-Christophe Pesquet, Ismail Ben Ayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has recently triggered wide attention in computer vision. Yet, current methods introduce key hyper-parameters, which control the prediction statistics of the test batches, such as the level of class balance, affecting performances significantly. Such hyper-parameters are empirically grid-searched over validation data, and their configurations may vary substantially with the target dataset and pre-training model, making such empirical searches both sub-optimal and computationally intractable. In this work, we advocate and introduce the unrolling paradigm, also referred to as "learning to optimize", in the context of few-shot learning, thereby learning efficiently and effectively a set of optimized hyper-parameters. Specifically, we unroll a generalization of the ubiquitous Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimizer into a neural network architecture, mapping each of its iterates to a layer and learning a set of key hyper-parameters over validation data. Our unrolling approach covers various statistical feature distributions and pre-training paradigms, including recent foundational vision-language models and standard vision-only classifiers. We report comprehensive experiments, which cover a breadth of fine-grained downstream image classification tasks, showing significant gains brought by the proposed unrolled EM algorithm over iterative variants. The achieved improvements reach up to 10% and 7.5% on vision-only and vision-language benchmarks, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yousef Yeganeh, Azade Farshad, Ioannis Charisiadis, Marta Hasny, Martin Hartenberger, Bj\"orn Ommer, Nassir Navab, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling by training on large datasets has been shown to enhance the quality and fidelity of image generation and manipulation with diffusion models; however, such large datasets are not always accessible in medical imaging due to cost and privacy issues, which contradicts one of the main applications of such models to produce synthetic samples where real data is scarce. Also, fine-tuning pre-trained general models has been a challenge due to the distribution shift between the medical domain and the pre-trained models. Here, we propose Latent Drift (LD) for diffusion models that can be adopted for any fine-tuning method to mitigate the issues faced by the distribution shift or employed in inference time as a condition. Latent Drifting enables diffusion models to be conditioned for medical images fitted for the complex task of counterfactual image generation, which is crucial to investigate how parameters such as gender, age, and adding or removing diseases in a patient would alter the medical images. We evaluate our method on three public longitudinal benchmark datasets of brain MRI and chest X-rays for counterfactual image generation. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains in various scenarios when combined with different fine-tuning schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yuxiang, Zeng Xinyi, Zeng Pinxian, Zu Chen, Yan Binyu, Zhou Jiliu, Wang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA) aims to transfer knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. Nevertheless, traditional methods primarily focus on achieving inter-domain alignment through sample-level constraints, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), neglecting three pivotal aspects: 1) the potential of data augmentation, 2) the significance of intra-domain alignment, and 3) the design of cluster-level constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel hardness-driven strategy for MDA tasks, named "A3MDA" , which collectively considers these three aspects through Adaptive hardness quantification and utilization in both data Augmentation and domain Alignment.To achieve this, "A3MDA" progressively proposes three Adaptive Hardness Measurements (AHM), i.e., Basic, Smooth, and Comparative AHMs, each incorporating distinct mechanisms for diverse scenarios. Specifically, Basic AHM aims to gauge the instantaneous hardness for each source/target sample. Then, hardness values measured by Smooth AHM will adaptively adjust the intensity level of strong data augmentation to maintain compatibility with the model's generalization capacity.In contrast, Comparative AHM is designed to facilitate cluster-level constraints. By leveraging hardness values as sample-specific weights, the traditional MMD is enhanced into a weighted-clustered variant, strengthening the robustness and precision of inter-domain alignment. As for the often-neglected intra-domain alignment, we adaptively construct a pseudo-contrastive matrix by selecting harder samples based on the hardness rankings, enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels, and shaping a well-clustered target feature space. Experiments on multiple MDA benchmarks show that " A3MDA " outperforms other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Jiang, Fangjinhua Wang, Silvano Galliani, Christoph Vogel, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based visual localization methods that use scene coordinate regression (SCR) offer the advantage of smaller map sizes. However, on datasets with complex illumination changes or image-level ambiguities, it remains a less robust alternative to feature matching methods. This work aims to close the gap. We introduce a covisibility graph-based global encoding learning and data augmentation strategy, along with a depth-adjusted reprojection loss to facilitate implicit triangulation. Additionally, we revisit the network architecture and local feature extraction module. Our method achieves state-of-the-art on challenging large-scale datasets without relying on network ensembles or 3D supervision. On Aachen Day-Night, we are 10$\times$ more accurate than previous SCR methods with similar map sizes and require at least 5$\times$ smaller map sizes than any other SCR method while still delivering superior accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhili Cheng, Yuge Tu, Ran Li, Shiqi Dai, Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Jiahao Li, Yang Shi, Tianyu Yu, Weize Chen, Lei Shi, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p>

<p>Abstract: You Look Only Once (YOLO) models have been widely used for building real-time object detectors across various domains. With the increasing frequency of new YOLO versions being released, key questions arise. Are the newer versions always better than their previous versions? What are the core innovations in each YOLO version and how do these changes translate into real-world performance gains? In this paper, we summarize the key innovations from YOLOv1 to YOLOv11, introduce a comprehensive benchmark called ODverse33, which includes 33 datasets spanning 11 diverse domains (Autonomous driving, Agricultural, Underwater, Medical, Videogame, Industrial, Aerial, Wildlife, Retail, Microscopic, and Security), and explore the practical impact of model improvements in real-world, multi-domain applications through extensive experimental results. We hope this study can provide some guidance to the extensive users of object detection models and give some references for future real-time object detector development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjeong Ha, Xiaomeng Jin, Jeonghwan Kim, Jiateng Liu, Zhenhailong Wang, Khanh Duy Nguyen, Ansel Blume, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models enable rapid concept design, making them widely used in AI-driven design. While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxuan Zhang, Yin Wu, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. This study presents fine-grained knowledge units, which merge textual snippets with entity images stored in vector databases. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. The proposed KU-RAG framework ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge and enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental findings demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts the performance of leading KB-VQA methods, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Zhu, Jiangbei Yue, Feixiang He, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis, and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is a transformative technology in e-commerce and fashion design, enabling realistic digital visualization of clothing on individuals. In this work, we propose VTON 360, a novel 3D VTON method that addresses the open challenge of achieving high-fidelity VTON that supports any-view rendering. Specifically, we leverage the equivalence between a 3D model and its rendered multi-view 2D images, and reformulate 3D VTON as an extension of 2D VTON that ensures 3D consistent results across multiple views. To achieve this, we extend 2D VTON models to include multi-view garments and clothing-agnostic human body images as input, and propose several novel techniques to enhance them, including: i) a pseudo-3D pose representation using normal maps derived from the SMPL-X 3D human model, ii) a multi-view spatial attention mechanism that models the correlations between features from different viewing angles, and iii) a multi-view CLIP embedding that enhances the garment CLIP features used in 2D VTON with camera information. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets and clothing images from e-commerce platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to represent visual scenes by identifying objects and their pairwise relationships, providing a structured understanding of image content. However, inherent challenges like long-tailed class distributions and prediction variability necessitate uncertainty quantification in SGG for its practical viability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Conformal Prediction (CP) based framework, adaptive to any existing SGG method, for quantifying their predictive uncertainty by constructing well-calibrated prediction sets over their generated scene graphs. These scene graph prediction sets are designed to achieve statistically rigorous coverage guarantees. Additionally, to ensure these prediction sets contain the most practically interpretable scene graphs, we design an effective MLLM-based post-processing strategy for selecting the most visually and semantically plausible scene graphs within these prediction sets. We show that our proposed approach can produce diverse possible scene graphs from an image, assess the reliability of SGG methods, and improve overall SGG performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiankang Wang, Zhihan Zhang, Zhihang Liu, Yang Li, Jiannan Ge, Hongtao Xie, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justus Westerhoff, Erblina Purelku, Jakob Hackstein, Leo Pinetzki, Lorenz Hufe</p>
<p>Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

<p>Abstract: The landscape of image generation has rapidly evolved, from early GAN-based approaches to diffusion models and, most recently, to unified generative architectures that seek to bridge understanding and generation tasks. Recent advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of architectural design and data scaling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Zhang, Yuhang Ma, Tengfei Li, Ziyu Lin, Yueying Wu, Junzhou Chen, Lin Zhang, Jia Hu, Tony Z. Qiu, Konghui Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rupayan Mallick, Sibo Dong, Nataniel Ruiz, Sarah Adel Bargal</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications of diffusion models for visual tasks have been quite noteworthy. This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Rubinstein, Ameya Prabhu, Matthias Bethge, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric learning (OCL) seeks to learn representations that only encode an object, isolated from other objects or background cues in a scene. This approach underpins various aims, including out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, sample-efficient composition, and modeling of structured environments. Most research has focused on developing unsupervised mechanisms that separate objects into discrete slots in the representation space, evaluated using unsupervised object discovery. However, with recent sample-efficient segmentation models, we can separate objects in the pixel space and encode them independently. This achieves remarkable zero-shot performance on OOD object discovery benchmarks, is scalable to foundation models, and can handle a variable number of slots out-of-the-box. Hence, the goal of OCL methods to obtain object-centric representations has been largely achieved. Despite this progress, a key question remains: How does the ability to separate objects within a scene contribute to broader OCL objectives, such as OOD generalization? We address this by investigating the OOD generalization challenge caused by spurious background cues through the lens of OCL. We propose a novel, training-free probe called Object-Centric Classification with Applied Masks (OCCAM), demonstrating that segmentation-based encoding of individual objects significantly outperforms slot-based OCL methods. However, challenges in real-world applications remain. We provide the toolbox for the OCL community to use scalable object-centric representations, and focus on practical applications and fundamental questions, such as understanding object perception in human cognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Dai, Xiaoshui Huang, Yunpeng Bai, Hao Guo, Hongping Gan, Ling Yang, Yilei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing geometric features on B-rep models is a cornerstone technique for multimedia content-based retrieval and has been widely applied in intelligent manufacturing. However, previous research often merely focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards, BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000 B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brettmann, Jakob Gr\"avinghoff, Marlene R\"uschoff, Marie Westhues</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language is a fundamental means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) community, enabling nuanced expression through gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Despite its critical role in facilitating interaction within the DHH population, significant barriers persist due to the limited fluency in sign language among the hearing population. Overcoming this communication gap through automatic sign language recognition (SLR) remains a challenge, particularly at a dynamic word-level, where temporal and spatial dependencies must be effectively recognized. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown potential in SLR, they are computationally intensive and have difficulties in capturing global temporal dependencies between video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model for word-level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks. The VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset, highlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%. Our study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great potential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the inclusion of DHH individuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junli Liu, Qizhi Chen, Zhigang Wang, Yiwen Tang, Yiting Zhang, Chi Yan, Dong Wang, Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Shukor, Enrico Fini, Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa, Matthieu Cord, Joshua Susskind, Alaaeldin El-Nouby</p>
<p>Abstract: Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those trained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn modality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Fang, Qinghua Tao, Yingwen Wu, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang, Jie Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a promising technique for certified robustness, and recently in RS the ensemble of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has shown state-of-the-art performances due to its variance reduction effect over Gaussian noises. However, such an ensemble brings heavy computation burdens in both training and certification, and yet under-exploits individual DNNs and their mutual effects, as the communication between these classifiers is commonly ignored in optimization. In this work, we consider a novel ensemble-based training way for a single DNN with multiple augmented heads, named as SmOothed Multi-head Ensemble (SOME). In SOME, similar to the pursuit of variance reduction via ensemble, an ensemble of multiple heads imposed with a cosine constraint inside a single DNN is employed with much cheaper training and certification computation overloads in RS. In such network structure, an associated training strategy is designed by introducing a circular communication flow among those augmented heads. That is, each head teaches its neighbor with the self-paced learning strategy using smoothed losses, which are specifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed multi-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme in SOME jointly contribute to the diversities among multiple heads and benefit their ensemble, leading to a competitively stronger certifiably-robust RS-based defense than ensembling multiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses (efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Luis Ponton, Eduard Pujol, Andreas Aristidou, Carlos Andujar, Nuria Pelechano</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality motion reconstruction that follows the user's movements can be achieved by high-end mocap systems with many sensors. However, obtaining such animation quality with fewer input devices is gaining popularity as it brings mocap closer to the general public. The main challenges include the loss of end-effector accuracy in learning-based approaches, or the lack of naturalness and smoothness in IK-based solutions. In addition, such systems are often finely tuned to a specific number of trackers and are highly sensitive to missing data e.g., in scenarios where a sensor is occluded or malfunctions. In response to these challenges, we introduce DragPoser, a novel deep-learning-based motion reconstruction system that accurately represents hard and dynamic on-the-fly constraints, attaining real-time high end-effectors position accuracy. This is achieved through a pose optimization process within a structured latent space. Our system requires only one-time training on a large human motion dataset, and then constraints can be dynamically defined as losses, while the pose is iteratively refined by computing the gradients of these losses within the latent space. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate a Temporal Predictor network, which employs a Transformer architecture to directly encode temporality within the latent space. This network ensures the pose optimization is confined to the manifold of valid poses and also leverages past pose data to predict temporally coherent poses. Results demonstrate that DragPoser surpasses both IK-based and the latest data-driven methods in achieving precise end-effector positioning, while it produces natural poses and temporally coherent motion. In addition, our system showcases robustness against on-the-fly constraint modifications, and exhibits exceptional adaptability to various input configurations and changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luisa Mao, Garrett Warnell, Peter Stone, Joydeep Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous robot navigation, terrain cost assignment is typically performed using a semantics-based paradigm in which terrain is first labeled using a pre-trained semantic classifier and costs are then assigned according to a user-defined mapping between label and cost. While this approach is rapidly adaptable to changing user preferences, only preferences over the types of terrain that are already known by the semantic classifier can be expressed. In this paper, we hypothesize that a machine-learning-based alternative to the semantics-based paradigm above will allow for rapid cost assignment adaptation to preferences expressed over new terrains at deployment time without the need for additional training. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce and study PACER, a novel approach to costmap generation that accepts as input a single birds-eye view (BEV) image of the surrounding area along with a user-specified preference context and generates a corresponding BEV costmap that aligns with the preference context. Using both real and synthetic data along with a combination of proposed training tasks, we find that PACER is able to adapt quickly to new user preferences while also exhibiting better generalization to novel terrains compared to both semantics-based and representation-learning approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Qiu, Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models, leveraging the power of Large Language Models, has recently demonstrated superior multimodal understanding and reasoning abilities, heralding a new era for artificial general intelligence. However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides insights for future enhancements in this critical area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Chen, Dong An, Yan Huang, Rongtao Xu, Yifei Su, Yonggen Ling, Ian Reid, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the task of Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) under the zero-shot setting. Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively. Moreover, CA-Nav demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world robot deployments across various indoor scenes and instructions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss, requiring early and accurate assessment to prevent irreversible damage. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) enables high-resolution retinal imaging, but automated segmentation performance varies, especially in cases with complex fluid and hyperreflective foci (HRF) patterns. This study proposes an active-learning-based deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of retinal layers, fluid, and HRF, using four state-of-the-art models: U-Net, SegFormer, SwinUNETR, and VM-UNet, trained on expert-annotated SD-OCT volumes. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation, and retinal thickness was quantified using a K-nearest neighbors algorithm and visualized with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) maps. SwinUNETR achieved the highest overall accuracy (DSC = 0.7719; NSD = 0.8149), while VM-UNet excelled in specific layers. Structural differences were observed between non-proliferative and proliferative DR, with layer-specific thickening correlating with visual acuity impairment. The proposed framework enables robust, clinically relevant DR assessment while reducing the need for manual annotation, supporting improved disease monitoring and treatment planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) improves diagnostic performance over full-field digital mammography (FFDM), false-positive recalls remain a concern in breast cancer screening. We developed a multi-modal artificial intelligence system integrating FFDM, synthetic mammography, and DBT to provide breast-level predictions and bounding-box localizations of suspicious findings. Our AI system, trained on approximately 500,000 mammography exams, achieved 0.945 AUROC on an internal test set. It demonstrated capacity to reduce recalls by 31.7% and radiologist workload by 43.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity, underscoring its potential to improve clinical workflows. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, reducing the gap to a perfect AUROC by 35.31%-69.14% relative to strong baselines. In prospective deployment across 18 sites, the system reduced recall rates for low-risk cases. An improved version, trained on over 750,000 exams with additional labels, further reduced the gap by 18.86%-56.62% across large external datasets. Overall, these results underscore the importance of utilizing all available imaging modalities, demonstrate the potential for clinical impact, and indicate feasibility of further reduction of the test error with increased training set when using large-capacity neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Chang, Leonor Fermoselle, Duy Ta, Bernadette Bucher, Luca Carlone, Jiuguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Chung, Wei Cai, Tapan Mukerji</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a systematic image registration approach to align 2D optical thin-section images within a 3D digital rock volume. Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.</p>
