<p><b>Authors:</b> Krisztian Balog, ChengXiang Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents. This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning, and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19464">Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shripad Vilasrao Deshmukh, Will Schwarzer, Scott Niekum</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Nowak</p>
<p>Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt; the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517">Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Teja Reddy Adapala</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19524">Score the Steps, Not Just the Goal: VLM-Based Subgoal Evaluation for Robotic Manipulation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramy ElMallah, Krish Chhajer, Chi-Guhn Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR), which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible (e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval, the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector; however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available. We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal, becomes a standard and reproducible practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Hong, Daniel Trejo Banos</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19590">What Does Your Benchmark Really Measure? A Framework for Robust Inference of AI Capabilities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathanael Jo, Ashia Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xutao Mao, Tao Liu, Hongying Zan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation, creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem. SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively, using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled solutions to complex reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anisha Garg, Engin Tekin, Yash More, David Bick, Nishit Neema, Ganesh Venkatesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced test-time computing strategies are essential for scaling reasoning models, but their effectiveness is capped by the models' poor self-evaluation. We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning (GRPO), that produces calibrated confidence scores and associated natural language reasoning for generated solutions. Our verifier improves the accuracy and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection. Crucially, it excels at identifying challenging failure modes, such as when both candidate solutions are identically incorrect, succeeding where standard methods like majority voting fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Qian, Zuxin Liu, Akshara Prabhakar, Jielin Qiu, Zhiwei Liu, Haolin Chen, Shirley Kokane, Heng Ji, Weiran Yao, Shelby Heinecke, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Huan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanxin Wang, Pawel Filipczuk, Anisha Garg, Amaan Dhada, Mohammad Hassanpour, David Bick, Ganesh Venkatesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783">Agentic Metacognition: Designing a &quot;Self-Aware&quot; Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection, this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key directions for future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800">Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghwan Lee, Hyukjun Yang, Bum Geun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19839">LatentGuard: Controllable Latent Steering for Robust Refusal of Attacks and Reliable Response Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huizhen Shu, Xuying Li, Zhuo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios. We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types, attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate significant improvements in both safety controllability and response interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach, showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajeet Kumar Singh, Rajsabi Surya, Anurag Tripathi, Santanu Choudhury, Sudhir Bisane</p>
<p>Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows, protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii) anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments, confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongtong Feng, Xin Wang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20067">MACD: Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis with Self-Learned Knowledge for LLM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenliang Li, Rui Yan, Xu Zhang, Li Chen, Hongji Zhu, Jing Zhao, Junjun Li, Mengru Li, Wei Cao, Zihang Jiang, Wei Wei, Kun Zhang, Shaohua Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymeric Vellinger, Nemanja Antonic, Elio Tuci</p>
<p>Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment. By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Nie, Yuewen Mei, Yihong Tang, Junlin He, Jie Sun, Haotian Shi, Wei Ma, Jian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator (SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkat Margapuri, Garik Kazanjian, Naren Kosaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Giusti, Ole Anton Werner, Riccardo Taiello, Matilde Carvalho Costa, Emre Tosun, Andrea Protani, Marc Molina, Rodrigo Lopes de Almeida, Paolo Cacace, Diogo Reis Santos, Luigi Serio</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs): machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance. Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines, with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Manzour, Catherine M. Elias, Omar M. Shehata, Rub\'en Izquierdo, Miguel \'Angel Sotelo</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Kang, Linda Vorberg, Andreas Maier, Alexander Katzmann, Oliver Taubmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhang, Jiaxin Zhang, Qiuyu Ren, Tahsin Saffat, Xiaoxuan Liu, Zitong Yang, Banghua Zhu, Yi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Bartoletti, Enrico Lipparini, Livio Pompianu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Luo, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Wang, Zhongyuan Zhao, Qingtian Wang, Zexu Li, Yue Wang, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability. Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in test accuracy and energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Wu, Zhen Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.</p>

The correlations with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently. Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed.

<p>Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite (https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Millie Vyas, Timothy Blattner, Alden Dima</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library, for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> V. S. Raghu Parupudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora, and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding (paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochi Li, Haoxuan Zhang, Edward Gehringer, Ting Xiao, Junhua Ding, Haihua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Braxton A. Morrison (University of California, San Francisco), Madhumita Sushil (University of California, San Francisco), Jacob S. Young (University of California, San Francisco)</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only (n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only (n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching, highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics, more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be critical for broader deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Montazeri, Waltenegus Dargie, Yunhe Feng, Kewei Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored, these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition without additional motion sensors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zejun Liu, Yunshan Chen, Chengxi Xie, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enhao Huang, Zhiyu Zhang, Tianxiang Xu, Chunshu Xia, Kaichun Hu, Yuchen Yang, Tongtong Pan, Dong Dong, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling.

<p>Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps". Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality, we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down. Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkai Huang, Junda Wu, Zhouhang Xie, Yu Xia, Rui Wang, Tong Yu, Subrata Mitra, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore, remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models' general capabilities on downstream tasks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Zhang, Jingbo Tan, Zhizhen Ren, Jintao Wang, Yihua Ma, Jian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: ISAC is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems, enabling simultaneous data transmission and target sensing. Among various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes, leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components: anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization. First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters. Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations, enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and estimation errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsong Wang, Tao Wu, Wang Lin, Yueying Feng, Gongsheng Yuan, Chang Yao, Jingyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output. To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query. Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefanos Bakirtzis, Paul Almasan, Jos\'e Su\'arez-Varela, Gabriel O. Ferreira, Michail Kalntis, Andr\'e Felipe Zanella, Ian Wassell, Andra Lutu</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable ray tracing has recently challenged the status quo in radio propagation modelling and digital twinning. Promising unprecedented speed and the ability to learn from real-world data, it offers a real alternative to conventional deep learning (DL) models. However, no experimental evaluation on production-grade networks has yet validated its assumed scalability or practical benefits. This leaves mobile network operators (MNOs) and the research community without clear guidance on its applicability. In this paper, we fill this gap by employing both differentiable ray tracing and DL models to emulate radio coverage using extensive real-world data collected from the network of a major MNO, covering 13 cities and more than 10,000 antennas. Our results show that, while differentiable ray-tracing simulators have contributed to reducing the efficiency-accuracy gap, they struggle to generalize from real-world data at a large scale, and they remain unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, DL models demonstrate higher accuracy and faster adaptation than differentiable ray-tracing simulators across urban, suburban, and rural deployments, achieving accuracy gains of up to 3 dB. Our experimental results aim to provide timely insights into a fundamental open question with direct implications on the wireless ecosystem and future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Navid Yazdanjue, Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Reza Nikoo, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming (MEGP), a computational intelligence framework that integrates cooperative coevolution and the multiview learning paradigm to address classification challenges in high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature spaces. MEGP decomposes the input space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer, enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven evolutionary learning. By unifying population-based optimization, multi-view representation learning, and cooperative coevolution, MEGP contributes a structurally adaptive and interpretable framework that advances emerging directions in evolutionary machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Ju, Mingdong Li, Haoyu Wang, Lei Liu, Youyang Qu, Mianxiong Dong, Victor C. M. Leung, Chau Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA) based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Fu, Peng Qin, Yueyue Zhang, Yifei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language, a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF, an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85% is achieved.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renyu Li, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Yao You, Kamil Pluci\'nski, Maximilian Operlejn, Crag Wolfe</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together, these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g., table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines, demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Chen, Yangyang Wu, Xiaoye Miao, Mengying Zhu, Meng Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts, \textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM) prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles, Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification, nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chimaobi Okite, Naihao Deng, Kiran Bodipati, Huaidian Hou, Joyce Chai, Rada Mihalcea</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models (GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale) can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mashkhal Abdalwahid Sidiq, Yimamu Kirubel Wondaferew</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by refining their capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Shaohui Mei, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure, here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt W. Hosp</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models, particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently. Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top 10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods, including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuqi Wang, Qinghe Zhang, Zhuopei Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent, state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to their chat interfaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial oversight and risk management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruanjun Li, Ziheng Liu, Yuanming Shi, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur very high inference cost because each output token is generated auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD) that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in providing efficient self-speculation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture, Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain, missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface. Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyu Ma, Yuan Shan, Jiahao Zhao, Nan Xu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity and stylistic coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangtao Lv, Haibin Chen, Yujin Yuan, Langming Liu, Shilei Liu, Yongwei Wang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point: each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts. Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference, based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance, requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyuan Shi, Yilin Zhai, Ping Dong, Zaijin You, Chao Zhan, Qing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.</p>

While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.</p>

We also support different topologies, mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration, learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration, mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Jin, Xiaocheng Fang, Haoyu Wang, Jun Li, Che Liu, Donglin Xie, Hongyan Li, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Ji, Zeyu Chen, Xiaoxiong Zhong, Yanan Ma, Sheng Zhang, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-server Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate communication bottlenecks of single-server FL. We focus on a typical multi-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with Overlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential of these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual roles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models between neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among different ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically select their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery time, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The overall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains local model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the respective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated edge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed models, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the updated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of each ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which indirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process, making it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Bin Duan, Jian-Long Hao, Tian-Yu Xiang, Xiao-Hu Zhou, Mei-Jiang Gui, Xiao-Liang Xie, Shi-Qi Liu, Zeng-Guang Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Chahoud, Lorenzo Mario Amorosa, Riccardo Marini, Luca De Nardis</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate outdoor positioning in cellular networks is hindered by sparse, heterogeneous measurement collections and the high cost of exhaustive site surveys. This paper introduces a lightweight, modular mobile data augmentation framework designed to enhance multi-cell fingerprinting-based positioning using operator-collected minimization of drive test (MDT) records. The proposed approach decouples spatial and radio-feature synthesis: kernel density estimation (KDE) models the empirical spatial distribution to generate geographically coherent synthetic locations, while a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN)-based block produces augmented per-cell radio fingerprints. The architecture is intentionally training-free, interpretable, and suitable for distributed or on-premise operator deployments, supporting privacy-aware workflows. We both validate each augmentation module independently and assess its end-to-end impact on fingerprinting-based positioning using a real-world MDT dataset provided by an Italian mobile network operator across diverse urban and peri-urban scenarios. Results show that the proposed KDE-KNN augmentation consistently improves positioning performance, with the largest benefits in sparsely sampled or structurally complex regions; we also observe region-dependent saturation effects as augmentation increases. The framework offers a practical, low-complexity path to enhance operator positioning services using existing mobile data traces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Chunyi Hou, Zheya Wang, Lei Wang, Zhengxin Yang, Jianfeng Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanouil Karystinaios, Francesco Foscarin, Gerhard Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on automatic music engraving, i.e., the creation of a humanly-readable musical score from musical content. This step is fundamental for all applications that include a human player, but it remains a mostly unexplored topic in symbolic music processing. In this work, we formalize the problem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph neural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and quantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly predict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature, stem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing pipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing systems that only specialize in specific subtasks. These results indicate that a shared GNN encoder with lightweight task-specific decoders in a multi-task setting offers a scalable and effective solution for automatic music engraving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Birk Torpmann-Hagen, P{\aa}l Halvorsen, Michael A. Riegler, Dag Johansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Chen, I-Chun Arthur Liu, Gaurav Sukhatme, Daniel Seita</p>
<p>Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Ye, Jun Cen, Jing Chen, Zhihe Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin G. Olivares, Malcolm Wolff, Tatiana Konstantinova, Shankar Ramasubramanian, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Andres Potapczynski, Willa Potosnak, Mengfei Cao, Boris Oreshkin, Dmitry Efimov</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hafijul Hoque Chowdhury, Riad Ahmed Anonto, Sourov Jajodia, Suryadipta Majumdar, Md. Shohrab Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of smart home IoT devices, users are increasingly exposed to various security risks, as evident from recent studies. While seeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left with their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online blogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular users trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go along with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the security of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and address the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we develop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security challenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in smart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We fine-tune relatively "smaller" transformer models, such as T5 and Flan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security. Unlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource hungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart homes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to explore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly improves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping users address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices. Our experiments on real-world user concerns show that our work improves the performance of the base models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) achieves natural-sounding speech and strong generalization, yet suffers from key limitations like generative artifacts and high inference latency. In this work, we systematically study artifact prediction and reduction in diffusion-based SE. We show that variance in speech embeddings can be used to predict phonetic errors during inference. Building on these findings, we propose an ensemble inference method guided by semantic consistency across multiple diffusion runs. This technique reduces WER by 15% in low-SNR conditions, effectively improving phonetic accuracy and semantic plausibility. Finally, we analyze the effect of the number of diffusion steps, showing that adaptive diffusion steps balance artifact suppression and latency. Our findings highlight semantic priors as a powerful tool to guide generative SE toward artifact-free outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cem Ashbaugh, Leon Baumg\"artner, Tim Gress, Nikita Sidorov, Daniel Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored, as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress. However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments, where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rose E. Guingrich, Michael S. A. Graziano</p>
<p>Abstract: Relationships with social artificial intelligence (AI) agents are on the rise. People report forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships with chatbots such as Replika, a type of social AI agent that is designed specifically for companionship. Concerns that companion chatbot relationships may harm or replace human ones have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. Prior research suggests that people's states of social need and their anthropomorphism of the AI agent may play a role in how human-AI interaction impacts human-human interaction. In this longitudinal study (N = 183), participants were randomly assigned to converse with a companion chatbot over text or to play text-based word games for 10 minutes a day for 21 consecutive days. During these 21 days, participants also completed four surveys and two audio-recorded interviews. We found that people's social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by interacting with a companion chatbot across 21 days compared to the control group. However, people who had a higher desire to socially connect anthropomorphized the chatbot more. Those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more indicated that the human-chatbot interaction had greater impacts on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. A mediation analysis suggested that the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes was mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphized the AI agent, which itself was related to the desire to socially connect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Lu, Steven Ding, Furkan Alaca, Philippe Charland</p>
<p>Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for "correct" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Li, Xiao Han, Yusong Li, Niklas Strauss, Matthias Schubert</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work, and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.</p>

Using 1,750 annotated C++ snippets of varying complexity, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs across six prompting strategies. Results show that all models achieve, on average, an F1 score of 0.8 for code up to 200 NLOC. Our findings show that a single illustrative example enables the smallest model (8B) to match the performance of a much larger 70B model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Fejgin, Paarth Neekhara, Xuesong Yang, Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman Jaehyeon Kim, Subhankar Ghosh, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Hutson, Daniel Vennemeyer, Aneesh Deshmukh, Justin Zhan, Tianyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models (LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%. Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity, enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for interactive reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danilo Trombino, Vincenzo Pecorella, Alessandro de Giulii, Davide Tresoldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly tasked with solving complex, knowledge-intensive problems where effective agent orchestration is critical. Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic, privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache, providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoshi Ling, Gang Liu, Guoli Ye, Jinyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding, particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Lu, Jerry Huang, Qiuhao Zeng, Xinyu Wang, Boxing Wang, Philippe Langlais, Yufei Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youpeng Zhao, Jinpeng LV, Di Wu, Jun Wang, Christopher Gooley</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has recently emerged as a promising direction to exploit the hidden reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). However, existing scaling methods narrowly focus on the compute-optimal Pareto-frontier, ignoring the simple fact that compute-optimal is not always system-optimal. In this work, we propose a system-driven perspective on TTS, analyzing how reasoning models scale against practical metrics, such as latency and cost-per-token. By evaluating the impact of popular optimizations such as tensor parallelism and speculative decoding, our preliminary analysis reveals the limitations of current methods and calls for a paradigm shift toward holistic, system-aware evaluations that capture the true essence of scaling laws at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salma Tika, Abdelkrim Haqiq, Essaid Sabir, Elmahdi Driouch</p>
<p>Abstract: As the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system continues its global deployment, both industry and academia have started conceptualizing the 6th generation (6G) to address the growing need for a progressively advanced and digital society. Even while 5G offers considerable advancements over LTE, it could struggle to be sufficient to meet all of the requirements, including ultra-high reliability, seamless automation, and ubiquitous coverage. In response, 6G is supposed to bring out a highly intelligent, automated, and ultra-reliable communication system that can handle a vast number of connected devices. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of 6G, beginning with its main stringent requirements while focusing on key enabling technologies such as terahertz (THz) communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces, massive MIMO and AI-driven networking that will shape the 6G networks. Furthermore, the paper lists various 6G applications and usage scenarios that will benefit from these advancements. At the end, we outline the potential challenges that must be addressed to achieve the 6G promises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Yang, Zixian Li, Jean Paul Bizimana, Niaz Zafri, Yongfeng Dong, Tianyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors. Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge, structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in real-world pedestrian safety systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngju Yoo, Jiaheng Hu, Yifeng Zhu, Bo Liu, Qiang Liu, Roberto Mart\'in-Mart\'in, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers, which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations, yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available at https://github.com/youngjuY/RoboSSM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu He, Shuai Huang, Yuwu Lu, Ming Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes, we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Zheng, Farhad Maleki</p>
<p>Abstract: In zero-shot text-to-speech, achieving a balance between fidelity to the target speaker and adherence to text content remains a challenge. While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Minzhao Lyu, Vijay Sivaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: To tap into the growing market of cloud gaming, whereby game graphics is rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as a video feed, network operators are creating monetizable assurance services that dynamically provision network resources. However, without accurately measuring cloud gaming user experience, they cannot assess the effectiveness of their provisioning methods. Basic measures such as bandwidth and frame rate by themselves do not suffice, and can only be interpreted in the context of the game played and the player activity within the game. This paper equips the network operator with a method to obtain a real-time measure of cloud gaming experience by analyzing network traffic, including contextual factors such as the game title and player activity stage. Our method is able to classify the game title within the first five seconds of game launch, and continuously assess the player activity stage as being active, passive, or idle. We deploy it in an ISP hosting NVIDIA cloud gaming servers for the region. We provide insights from hundreds of thousands of cloud game streaming sessions over a three-month period into the dependence of bandwidth consumption and experience level on the gameplay contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening" to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance. Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLMs gain adoption in high-stakes domains like mental health, domain experts are increasingly consulted to provide input into policies governing their behavior. From an observation of 19 policymaking workshops with 9 experts over 15 weeks, we identified opportunities to better support rapid experimentation, feedback, and iteration for collaborative policy design processes. We present PolicyPad, an interactive system that facilitates the emerging practice of LLM policy prototyping by drawing from established UX prototyping practices, including heuristic evaluation and storyboarding. Using PolicyPad, policy designers can collaborate on drafting a policy in real time while independently testing policy-informed model behavior with usage scenarios. We evaluate PolicyPad through workshops with 8 groups of 22 domain experts in mental health and law, finding that PolicyPad enhanced collaborative dynamics during policy design, enabled tight feedback loops, and led to novel policy contributions. Overall, our work paves participatory paths for advancing AI alignment and safety.</p>

We propose DyBBT, a novel dialog policy learning framework that formalizes the exploration challenge through a structured cognitive state space capturing dialog progression, user uncertainty, and slot dependency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Geiger, Tamim Asfour, Neville Hogan, Johannes Lachner</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gunbir Singh Baveja, Mark Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios, and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.</p>

<p>Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss; it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation). We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a powerful capability of in-context learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs. posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset (368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs. non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains, with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902. By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes.

Over one year, 300 engineers across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8% reduction in PR review cycle time.
  Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61% increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30 to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an overall 28% increase in code shipment volume.

<p>Abstract: Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems. This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially reducing computational resource requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this, we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Zheng, Xueyuan Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances. Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves, showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code at: https://github.com/dfr-code/ExpFace.</p>

<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video, spatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time semantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities of existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack efficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in supporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE introduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector, spatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer for hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for efficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL query engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x on read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Heidari, Wei Zhang, Ying Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.</p>

In this study, we present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning.

In this work, we present the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocheng Fang, Jiarui Jin, Haoyu Wang, Che Liu, Jieyi Cai, Guangkun Nie, Jun Li, Hongyan Li, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis. Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world cardiovascular screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wence Ji, Jiancan Wu, Aiying Li, Shuyi Zhang, Junkang Wu, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Bosio, Greg Woelki, Noureldin Hendy, Nicholas Roy, Byungsoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kohsuke Kubota, Shonosuke Sugasawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer rewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage increased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on customers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although regression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference tasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds, strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under threshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending distribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers strategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those unaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach consisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a sample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting posterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate heterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable inference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.</p>

This paper establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate $O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a structured alternative to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive, neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land). Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on resolving stability hallucinations (e.g., repetitive or omitted speech) in LLM-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models by improving and leveraging the attention mechanism. First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent mobile applications has made multi-agent collaboration with Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) essential in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, training LLMs in such environments remains challenging due to heavy computation, high end-to-end latency, and limited model generalization. We introduce CollaPipe, a hybrid distributed learning framework that integrates collaborative pipeline parallelism with federated aggregation to support self-evolving intelligent networks. In CollaPipe, the encoder part is adaptively partitioned into variable-sized segments and deployed across mobile devices for pipeline-parallel training, while the decoder is deployed on edge servers to handle generative tasks. Then we perform global model update via federated aggregation. To enhance training efficiency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that adaptively allocates model segments, micro-batches, bandwidth, and transmission power. We derive and use a closed-form convergence bound to design an Dynamic Segment Scheduling and Resource Allocation (DSSDA) algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, ensuring system stability under long-term constraints. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks with Transformer and BERT models show that CollaPipe improves computation efficiency by up to 15.09%, reduces end-to-end latency by at least 48.98%, and cuts single device memory usage by more than half, enabling online learning in heterogeneous and dynamic communication environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Hsiang Lin, Sheng-Lun Wei, Hen-Hsen Huang, Hsin-Hsi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs' sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchuan Zhao, Wei Zeng, Tianle Lyu, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt, compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture, CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens, preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katja Naasunnguaq Jagd, Rachael DeVries, Ole Winther</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets. In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Remo Sasso, Michelangelo Conserva, Dominik Jeurissen, Paulo Rauber</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanouil Panagiotou, Beno\^it Ronval, Arjun Roy, Ludwig Bothmann, Bernd Bischl, Siegfried Nijssen, Eirini Ntoutsi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing human mesh recovery methods assume a standard human body structure, overlooking diverse anatomical conditions such as limb loss. This assumption introduces bias when applied to individuals with amputations - a limitation further exacerbated by the scarcity of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we propose Amputated Joint Aware 3D Human Mesh Recovery (AJAHR), which is an adaptive pose estimation framework that improves mesh reconstruction for individuals with limb loss. Our model integrates a body-part amputation classifier, jointly trained with the mesh recovery network, to detect potential amputations. We also introduce Amputee 3D (A3D), which is a synthetic dataset offering a wide range of amputee poses for robust training. While maintaining competitive performance on non-amputees, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for amputated individuals. Additional materials can be found at the project webpage.</p>

<p>Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world, comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri, Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models, including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis, offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning. By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable resource for the machine translation research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edmund Bu, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiao Wu, Yao Lu, Jie Wen, Hao Sun, Qi Zhou, Guangming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject attacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without changing the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple \textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances clean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples instead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the sample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited improvements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit unsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a mere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional collaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address the above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple combination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance both evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks. Therefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both stealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically, Component A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an appropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable ``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples with similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote stealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors through distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR, with stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B. Furthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarmistha Das, R E Zera Marveen Lyngkhoi, Kirtan Jain, Vinayak Goyal, Sriparna Saha, Manish Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining, articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a 5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users' need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions, also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks (pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score, among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to provide a platform for users to express complaints through video.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: This study constructs a fully data-driven and reproducible Southeast Asia Influence Index (SAII v3) to reduce bias from expert scoring and subjective weighting while mapping hierarchical power structures across the eleven ASEAN nations. We aggregate authoritative open-source indicators across four dimensions (economic, military, diplomatic, socio-technological) and apply a three-tiered standardization chain quantile-Box-Cox-min-max to mitigate outliers and skewness. Weights are obtained through equal-weight integration of Entropy Weighting Method (EWM), CRITIC, and PCA. Robustness is assessed via Kendall's tau, +/-20% weight perturbation, and 10,000 bootstrap iterations, with additional checks including +/-10% dimensional sensitivity and V2-V3 bump chart comparisons. Results show integrated weights: Economy 35-40%, Military 20-25%, Diplomacy about 20%, Socio-Technology about 15%. The regional landscape exhibits a one-strong, two-medium, three-stable, and multiple-weak pattern: Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia lead, while Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam form a mid-tier competitive band. V2 and V3 rankings are highly consistent (Kendall's tau = 0.818), though small mid-tier reorderings appear (Thailand and the Philippines rise, Vietnam falls), indicating that v3 is more sensitive to structural equilibrium. ASEAN-11 average sensitivity highlights military and socio-technological dimensions as having the largest marginal effects (+/-0.002). In conclusion, SAII v3 delivers algorithmic weighting and auditable reproducibility, reveals multidimensional drivers of influence in Southeast Asia, and provides actionable quantitative evidence for resource allocation and policy prioritization by regional governments and external partners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albina Klepach, Egor E. Nuzhin, Alexey A. Tsukanov, Nikolay V. Brilliantov</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms, and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy.

<p>Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection. SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations, thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment, we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of 0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation for the further development of automatic harvest robots.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is increasingly pervasive across domains, with ever more complex models delivering impressive predictive performance. This fast technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost, with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid, adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of modern AI systems without significantly compromising accuracy requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Broersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT) give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it worse.</p>

Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes). Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vani Kanjirangat, Tanja Samard\v{z}i\'c, Ljiljana Dolamic, Fabio Rinaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs. non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses, including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights, reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper mismatches at the script or token level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rami Zewail</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alastair Poole, Stig McArthur, Saravan Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Liu, Wenhan Cao, Chang Liu, Zeyu He, Tianyi Zhang, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Lithgow-Serrano, Vani Kanjirangat, Alessandro Antonucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models (Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification (direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat, with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing. Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence, 32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11% vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sujeong Lee, Hayoung Lee, Seongsoo Heo, Wonik Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juana Valeria Hurtado, Rohit Mohan, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hsi-adapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Li, Yinan Zheng, Yue Wang, Huimin Wang, Hang Zhao, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan, Kun Zhan, Xianpeng Lang</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkan Karabulut, Daniel Daza, Paul Groth, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making. However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks. Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Lyu, Junchuan Zhao, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven facial animation has made significant progress in multimedia applications, with diffusion models showing strong potential for talking-face synthesis. However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework. Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions. Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy -- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98% sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions (negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the integration of emotional intelligence into artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on affective computing and the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to recognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions. That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaojun Nie, Jun Zhou, Guanxiang Wang, Shisong Wud, Zichen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.

<p>Abstract: Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts, threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of agentic AI workflows unlocks novel opportunities for computer systems design and optimization.

Our key insight is to integrate formal verification feedback from HDL tools directly into workflow generation, reducing the cost of gradient-based updates or prolonged reasoning traces. Our method improves synthesis performance by 5-7% for pass@k over fine-tuned baselines, while requiring only a few hundred training examples, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction in supervision cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiejun Wang, Rui Wang, Xudong Mou, Mengyuan Ma, Tianyu Wo, Renyu Yang, Xudong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: People face overwhelming information during work activities, necessitating effective organization and management strategies. Even in personal lives, individuals must keep, annotate, organize, and retrieve knowledge from daily routines. The collection of records for future reference is known as a personal knowledge base. Note-taking applications are valuable tools for building and maintaining these bases, often called a ''second brain''. This paper presents a case study on how people build and explore personal knowledge bases for various purposes. We selected the note-taking tool Obsidian and researchers from a Brazilian lab for an in-depth investigation. Our investigation reveals interesting findings about how researchers build and explore their personal knowledge bases. A key finding is that participants' knowledge retrieval strategy influences how they build and maintain their content. We suggest potential features for an AI system to support this process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Khule, Stefan Marksteiner, Jose Alguindigue, Hannes Fuchs, Sebastian Fischmeister, Apurva Narayan</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern automotive development, security testing is critical for safeguarding systems against increasingly advanced threats. Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful, generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents. Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then, we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot, Gebrearegawi Gidey, Wolfgang Nejdl</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment, we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines, with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation. Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware modeling and reproducible benchmarks in bridging the performance gap for underrepresented languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deokjae Lee, Hyun Oh Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Yang, Wei Zheng, Xiang Chen, Yifan Sun, Fengji Zhang, Terry Yue Zhuo</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in Verilog generation due to limited domain-specific knowledge. While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics, hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking. Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang, Jinghui Qin, Wushao Wen, Qingling Li, Shanshan Zhong, Zhongzhan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Wu, Zheyuan Liu, Chongyang Gao, Ren Wang, Kaize Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Burgert, Oliver Stoll, Paolo Rota, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin An, Ruijie Li, Qiao Ning, Hui Li, Qian Ma, Shikai Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Chai, Anqing Jiang, Hao Jiang, Shiyi Mu, Zichong Gu, Shugong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20277">Investigating Security Implications of Automatically Generated Code on the Software Supply Chain</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofan Li, Xing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed significant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if developers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks into their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community. However, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code, including fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data, all of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this paper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these inherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven potential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code, and continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in LLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows, while some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the security of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and severity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on SSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four popular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified SSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce fabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC threats.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayu Tan, Jing Chen, Xiaoping Zhou, Yansen Su, Chunhou Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development.

<p>Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Wei, Xiaoran Liu, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods offer a token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a persistent performance gap has limited their adoption. We identify a core latent instability issue when scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT: as the number of reasoning tokens increases, training often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis shows that this instability arises from latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing semantic diversity, caused by insufficient step-level supervision in current implicit CoT methods. To address this, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The auxiliary decoder is removed at inference, preserving the efficiency of implicit CoT with no added overhead. It also provides interpretability by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization and diagnosis. SIM-CoT significantly improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of implicit CoT methods, boosting Coconut by +8.2\% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0\% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. It further surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1\% with 2.3$\times$ greater token efficiency, while closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

<p>Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.</p>

DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven pipelines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atousa Arzanipour, Rouzbeh Behnia, Reza Ebrahimi, Kaushik Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p>

This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization, which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umer Siddique, Abhinav Sinha, Yongcan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms, ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gebrearegawi Gebremariam, Hailay Teklehaymanot, Gebregewergs Mezgebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic, and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge, and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data, corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system considering morphological variations of the language.

<p>Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yu Koh, Stephen McAleer, Daniel Fried, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work. Our code and models are publicly released at https://jykoh.com/search-agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Vishwanath, Louise A. Dennis, Marija Slavkovik</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine ethics is the field that studies how ethical behaviour can be accomplished by autonomous systems. While there exist some systematic reviews aiming to consolidate the state of the art in machine ethics prior to 2020, these tend to not include work that uses reinforcement learning agents as entities whose ethical behaviour is to be achieved. The reason for this is that only in the last years we have witnessed an increase in machine ethics studies within reinforcement learning. We present here a systematic review of reinforcement learning for machine ethics and machine ethics within reinforcement learning. Additionally, we highlight trends in terms of ethics specifications, components and frameworks of reinforcement learning, and environments used to result in ethical behaviour. Our systematic review aims to consolidate the work in machine ethics and reinforcement learning thus completing the gap in the state of the art machine ethics landscape</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Song, Yugin Tan, Zicheng Zhu, Yibin Feng, Yi-Chieh Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems - systems with multiple independent AI agents working together to achieve a common goal - are becoming increasingly prevalent in daily life. Drawing inspiration from the phenomenon of human group social influence, we investigate whether a group of AI agents can create social pressure on users to agree with them, potentially changing their stance on a topic. We conducted a study in which participants discussed social issues with either a single or multiple AI agents, and where the agents either agreed or disagreed with the user's stance on the topic. We found that conversing with multiple agents (holding conversation content constant) increased the social pressure felt by participants, and caused a greater shift in opinion towards the agents' stances on each topic. Our study shows the potential advantages of multi-agent systems over single-agent platforms in causing opinion change. We discuss design implications for possible multi-agent systems that promote social good, as well as the potential for malicious actors to use these systems to manipulate public opinion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlan Chen, Qijie He, Pei Liu, Wei Ma, Ziyuan Pu, Nan Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Crash frequency modelling analyzes the impact of factors like traffic volume, road geometry, and environmental conditions on crash occurrences. Inaccurate predictions can distort our understanding of these factors, leading to misguided policies and wasted resources, which jeopardize traffic safety. A key challenge in crash frequency modelling is the prevalence of excessive zero observations, caused by underreporting, the low probability of crashes, and high data collection costs. These zero observations often reduce model accuracy and introduce bias, complicating safety decision making. While existing approaches, such as statistical methods, data aggregation, and resampling, attempt to address this issue, they either rely on restrictive assumptions or result in significant information loss, distorting crash data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid VAE-Diffusion neural network, designed to reduce zero observations and handle the complexities of multi-type tabular crash data (count, ordinal, nominal, and real-valued variables). We assess the synthetic data quality generated by this model through metrics like similarity, accuracy, diversity, and structural consistency, and compare its predictive performance against traditional statistical models. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid VAE-Diffusion model outperforms baseline models across all metrics, offering a more effective approach to augmenting crash data and improving the accuracy of crash frequency predictions. This study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance traffic safety by improving crash frequency modelling and informing better policy decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisong Gong, Jing Li, Junfei Wu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Claim verification is the task of determining whether a claim is supported or refuted by evidence. Self-improvement methods, where reasoning chains are generated and those leading to correct results are selected for training, have succeeded in tasks like mathematical problem solving. However, in claim verification, this approach struggles. Low-quality reasoning chains may falsely match binary truth labels, introducing faulty reasoning into the self-improvement process and ultimately degrading performance. To address this, we propose STRIVE: Structured Reasoning for Self-Improved Verification. Our method introduces a structured reasoning design with Claim Decomposition, Entity Analysis, and Evidence Grounding Verification. These components improve reasoning quality, reduce errors, and provide additional supervision signals for self-improvement. STRIVE begins with a warm-up phase, where the base model is fine-tuned on a small number of annotated examples to learn the structured reasoning design. It is then applied to generate reasoning chains for all training examples, selecting only those that are correct and structurally sound for subsequent self-improvement training. We demonstrate that STRIVE achieves significant improvements over baseline models, with a 31.4% performance gain over the base model and 20.7% over Chain of Thought on the HOVER datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, but their opaque training on uncurated internet data posse critical limitations for high-stakes decision-making, such as in neurosurgery. We present CNS-Obsidian, a neurosurgical VLM trained on peer-reviewed neurosurgical literature, and demonstrate its clinical utility compared with GPT-4o in a real-world setting. We compiled 23,984 articles from Neurosurgery Publications journals, yielding 78,853 figures and captions. Using GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet-3.5, we converted these image-text pairs into 263,064 training samples across three formats: instruction fine-tuning, multiple-choice questions, and differential diagnosis. We trained CNS-Obsidian, a fine-tune of the 34-billion parameter LLaVA-Next model. In a blinded, randomized deployment trial at NYU Langone Health (Aug 30-Nov 30, 2024), neurosurgeons were assigned to use either CNS-Obsidian or GPT-4o as a diagnostic co-pilot after patient consultations. Primary outcomes were diagnostic helpfulness and accuracy. CNS-Obsidian matched GPT-4o on synthetic questions (76.13% vs 77.54%, p=0.235), but only achieved 46.81% accuracy on human-generated questions versus GPT-4o's 65.70% (p<10-15). In the randomized trial, 70 consultations were evaluated (32 CNS-Obsidian, 38 GPT-4o) from 959 total consults. CNS-Obsidian received positive ratings in 40.62% of cases versus 57.89% for GPT-4o (p=0.230). Both models included correct diagnosis in approximately 60% of cases (59.38% vs 65.79%, p=0.626). Domain-specific VLMs trained on curated scientific literature can approach frontier model performance in specialized medical domains despite being orders of magnitude smaller and less expensive to train. However, low clinical utilization suggests chatbot interfaces may not align with specialist workflows, indicating need for alternative AI integration strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of mobile agents can significantly advance their development and real-world applicability. However, existing benchmarks lack practicality and scalability due to the extensive manual effort in defining task reward signals and implementing evaluation codes. We propose AutoEval, an evaluation framework which tests mobile agents without any manual effort. Our approach designs a UI state change representation which can be used to automatically generate task reward signals, and employs a Judge System for autonomous evaluation. Evaluation shows AutoEval can automatically generate reward signals with high correlation to human-annotated signals, and achieve high accuracy (up to 94%) in autonomous evaluation comparable to human evaluation. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art mobile agents using our framework, providing insights into their performance and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibin Xiong, Yimeng Chen, Dmitrii Khizbullin, Mingchen Zhuge, J\"urgen Schmidhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predefined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose WriteHERE, a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types: retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saimouli Katragadda, Cho-Ying Wu, Yuliang Guo, Xinyu Huang, Guoquan Huang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a family of sampling-based search algorithms widely used for online planning in sequential decision-making domains and at the heart of many recent advances in artificial intelligence. Understanding the behavior of MCTS agents is difficult for developers and users due to the frequently large and complex search trees that result from the simulation of many possible futures, their evaluations, and their relationships. This paper presents our ongoing investigation into potential explanations for the decision-making and behavior of MCTS. A weakness of MCTS is that it constructs a highly selective tree and, as a result, can miss crucial moves and fall into tactical traps. Full-width minimax search constitutes the solution. We integrate shallow minimax search into the rollout phase of multi-agent MCTS and use process mining technique to explain agents' strategies in 3v3 checkers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic computing. We present a neuromorphic reservoir computing hardware system capable of driving real-time personalized free-run stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus train. The system achieves 83.33% accuracy in forecasting seizure occurrences during the training phase. We validate the system using hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, achieving seizure reduction >97% during the real-time processing while primarily using instantaneous stimulation frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical practice. Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment, leveraging their sparse and event-driven processing for real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Khoja, Devanshu Gupta, Yanjie Fu, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context, they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible, step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks, Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets, reducing both API calls and error rates. The code, along with other associated scripts, are available at https://coral-lab-asu.github.io/weaver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueqiang Ouyang, Jia Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Infertility, a pressing global health concern, affects a substantial proportion of individuals worldwide. While advancements in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have offered effective interventions, conventional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) procedures still encounter significant hurdles in enhancing pregnancy success rates. Key challenges include the inherent subjectivity in embryo grading and the inefficiency of multi-modal data integration. Against this backdrop, the adoption of AI-driven technologies has emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these issues. This article presents a comprehensive review of the progress in AI applications for embryo grading and pregnancy prediction from a novel perspective, with a specific focus on the utilization of different modal data, such as static images, time-lapse videos, and structured tabular data. The reason for this perspective is that reorganizing tasks based on data sources can not only more accurately depict the essence of the problem but also help clarify the rationality and limitations of model design. Furthermore, this review critically examines the core challenges in contemporary research, encompassing the intricacies of multi-modal feature fusion, constraints imposed by data scarcity, limitations in model generalization capabilities, and the dynamically evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. On this basis, it explicitly identifies potential avenues for future research, aiming to provide actionable guidance for advancing the application of multi-modal AI in the field of ART.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Jarne Ornia, Nicholas Bishop, Joel Dyer, Wei-Chen Lee, Ani Calinescu, Doyne Farmer, Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.</p>

This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B parameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while achieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and quantization techniques in the same compression ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhigya Verma, Sriram Puttagunta, Seganrasan Subramanian, Sravan Ramachandran</p>
<p>Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananth Hariharan, Vardhan Dongre, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur, Gokhan Tur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuofan Chen, Jiyuan He, Yichi Zhang, Xing Hu, Haoxing Wen, Jun Bai, Wenge Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its demand for multi-step reasoning and abstract conceptual integration. While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units, cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems; meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity, generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218">Similarity Field Theory: A General Mathematical Framework for Intelligence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei-Sing Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and present empirical results using large language models as experimental probes of societal cognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranga Shaarad Ayyagari, Revanth Raj Eega, Ambedkar Dukkipati</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are predominantly developed for stationary environments, and the limited literature that considers nonstationary environments often involves specific assumptions about changes that can occur in transition probability matrices and reward functions. Considering that real-world applications involve environments that continuously evolve due to various external events, and humans make decisions by discerning patterns in historical events, this study investigates Markov Decision Processes under the influence of an external temporal process. We establish the conditions under which the problem becomes tractable, allowing it to be addressed by considering only a finite history of events, based on the properties of the perturbations introduced by the exogenous process. We propose and theoretically analyze a policy iteration algorithm to tackle this problem, which learns policies contingent upon the current state of the environment, as well as a finite history of prior events of the exogenous process. We show that such an algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. However, we provide a guarantee for policy improvement in regions of the state space determined by the approximation error induced by considering tractable policies and value functions. We also establish the sample complexity of least-squares policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms that consider approximations due to the incorporation of only a finite history of temporal events. While our results are applicable to general discrete-time processes satisfying certain conditions on the rate of decay of the influence of their events, we further analyze the case of discrete-time Hawkes processes with Gaussian marks. We performed experiments to demonstrate our findings for policy evaluation and deployment in traditional control environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie Hou, Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil, Michael Shavlovsky, Giulia Fanti, Yesh Dattatreya, Sujay Sanghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: On tabular data, a significant body of literature has shown that current deep learning (DL) models perform at best similarly to Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), while significantly underperforming them on outlier data. However, these works often study idealized problem settings which may fail to capture complexities of real-world scenarios. We identify a natural tabular data setting where DL models can outperform GBDTs: tabular Learning-to-Rank (LTR) under label scarcity. Tabular LTR applications, including search and recommendation, often have an abundance of unlabeled data, and scarce labeled data. We show that DL rankers can utilize unsupervised pretraining to exploit this unlabeled data. In extensive experiments over both public and proprietary datasets, we show that pretrained DL rankers consistently outperform GBDT rankers on ranking metrics -- sometimes by as much as 38% -- both overall and on outliers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuecheng Li, Lele Fu, Sheng Huang, Chuan Chen, Lei Yang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as one of the optimal solutions for node-level and supervised tasks. However, for structure-related and unsupervised tasks such as graph clustering, current GCL algorithms face difficulties acquiring the necessary cluster-level information, resulting in poor performance. In addition, general unsupervised GCL improves the performance of downstream tasks by increasing the number of negative samples, which leads to severe class collision and unfairness of graph clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a Cluster-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework (CueGCL) to jointly learn clustering results and node representations. Specifically, we design a personalized self-training (PeST) strategy for unsupervised scenarios, which enables our model to capture precise cluster-level personalized information. With the benefit of the PeST, we alleviate class collision and unfairness without sacrificing the overall model performance. Furthermore, aligned graph clustering (AGC) is employed to obtain the cluster partition, where we align the clustering space of our downstream task with that in PeST to achieve more consistent node embeddings. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing it yields an embedding space with a significantly discernible cluster structure. Extensive experimental results also show our CueGCL exhibits state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with different scales.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251">CLIP Can Understand Depth</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohee Kim, Jisu Kang, Dunam Kim, Seokju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity as reading and summarization aids. However, little is known about their potential benefits when integrated with mixed reality (MR) interfaces to support everyday reading. In this iterative investigation, we developed RealitySummary, an MR reading assistant that seamlessly integrates LLMs with always-on camera access, OCR-based text extraction, and augmented spatial and visual responses. Developed iteratively, RealitySummary evolved across three versions, each shaped by user feedback and reflective analysis: 1) a preliminary user study to understand reader perceptions (N=12), 2) an in-the-wild deployment to explore real-world usage (N=11), and 3) a diary study to capture insights from real-world work contexts (N=5). Our empirical studies' findings highlight the unique advantages of combining AI and MR, including always-on implicit assistance, long-term temporal history, minimal context switching, and spatial affordances, demonstrating significant potential for future LLM-MR interfaces beyond traditional screen-based interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqi Zhang, Shuai Yuan, Honghan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Kuleshov, Evgenia Romanenkova, Vladislav Zhuzhel, Galina Boeva, Evgeni Vorsin, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisong Fu, Fei Wang, Zezhi Shao, Boyu Diao, Lin Wu, Zhulin An, Chengqing Yu, Yujie Li, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxi Ye, Grace Chu, Yanfeng Liu, Yichi Zhang, Lukasz Lew, Li Zhang, Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Ji Shuai, Yang Zhang, Uktu Pamuksuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations.

The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</p>

In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.</p>

However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heehwan Wang, Joonwoo Kwon, Sooyoung Kim, Jungwoo Seo, Shinjae Yoo, Yuewei Lin, Jiook Cha</p>
<p>Abstract: Music style transfer enables personalized music creation by blending the structure of a source with the stylistic attributes of a reference. Existing text-conditioned and diffusion-based approaches show promise but often require paired datasets, extensive training, or detailed annotations. We present Stylus, a training-free framework that repurposes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for music style transfer in the mel-spectrogram domain. Stylus manipulates self-attention by injecting style key-value features while preserving source queries to maintain musical structure. To improve fidelity, we introduce a phase-preserving reconstruction strategy that avoids artifacts from Griffin-Lim reconstruction, and we adopt classifier-free-guidance-inspired control for adjustable stylization and multi-style blending. In extensive evaluations, Stylus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 34.1% higher content preservation and 25.7% better perceptual quality without any additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Zakizadeh, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately measuring gender stereotypical bias in language models is a complex task with many hidden aspects. Current benchmarks have underestimated this multifaceted challenge and failed to capture the full extent of the problem. This paper examines the inconsistencies between intrinsic stereotype benchmarks. We propose that currently available benchmarks each capture only partial facets of gender stereotypes, and when considered in isolation, they provide just a fragmented view of the broader landscape of bias in language models. Using StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs as case studies, we investigated how data distribution affects benchmark results. By applying a framework from social psychology to balance the data of these benchmarks across various components of gender stereotypes, we demonstrated that even simple balancing techniques can significantly improve the correlation between different measurement approaches. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender stereotyping in language models and point to new directions for developing more refined techniques to detect and reduce bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue that mutual distillation between reinforcement learning policies serves as an implicit regularization, preventing them from overfitting to irrelevant features. We highlight two separate contributions: (i) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (ii) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Ultimately, we do not claim to achieve state-of-the-art performance but rather focus on uncovering the underlying principles of generalization and deepening our understanding of its mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Jayannavar, Liliang Ren, Marisa Hudspeth, Risham Sidhu, Charlotte Lambert, Ariel Cordes, Elizabeth Kaplan, Anjali Narayan-Chen, Julia Hockenmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing interactive agents that can understand language, perceive their surroundings, and act within the physical world is a long-standing goal of AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019), a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated 3D Blocks World environment, offers a rich platform to work towards this goal. In this work, we focus on the Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask: predicting B's actions in a multimodal game context (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020) - a challenging testbed for grounded instruction following, with limited training data. We holistically re-examine this task and introduce BAP v2 to address key challenges in evaluation, training data, and modeling. Specifically, we define an enhanced evaluation benchmark, featuring a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics that also reveal spatial reasoning as the primary performance bottleneck. To address data scarcity and to teach models basic spatial skills, we generate different types of synthetic MCBT data. We observe that current, LLM-based SOTA models trained on the human BAP dialogues fail on these simpler, synthetic BAP ones, but show that training models on this synthetic data improves their performance across the board. We also introduce a new SOTA model, Llama-CRAFTS, which leverages richer input representations, and achieves an F1 score of 53.0 on the BAP v2 task and strong performance on the synthetic data. While this result marks a notable 6 points improvement over previous work, it also underscores the task's remaining difficulty, establishing BAP v2 as a fertile ground for future research, and providing a useful measure of the spatial capabilities of current text-only LLMs in such embodied tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Fumanal-Idocin, Raquel Fernandez-Peralta, Javier Andreu-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule-based models are essential for high-stakes decision-making due to their transparency and interpretability, but their discrete nature creates challenges for optimization and scalability. In this work, we present the Fuzzy Rule-based Reasoner (FRR), a novel gradient-based rule learning system that supports strict user constraints over rule-based complexity while achieving competitive performance. To maximize interpretability, the FRR uses semantically meaningful fuzzy logic partitions, unattainable with existing neuro-fuzzy approaches, and sufficient (single-rule) decision-making, which avoids the combinatorial complexity of additive rule ensembles. Through extensive evaluation across 40 datasets, FRR demonstrates: (1) superior performance to traditional rule-based methods (e.g., $5\%$ average accuracy over RIPPER); (2) comparable accuracy to tree-based models (e.g., CART) using rule bases $90\%$ more compact; and (3) achieves $96\%$ of the accuracy of state-of-the-art additive rule-based models while using only sufficient rules and requiring only $3\%$ of their rule base size.</p>

<p>Abstract: While spatial reasoning has made progress in object localization relationships, it often overlooks object orientation-a key factor in 6-DoF fine-grained manipulation. Traditional pose representations rely on pre-defined frames or templates, limiting generalization and semantic grounding. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the "plug-in" direction of a USB or the "handle" direction of a cup). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with semantic orientations, and develop PointSO, a general model for zero-shot semantic orientation prediction. By integrating semantic orientation into VLM agents, our SoFar framework enables 6-DoF spatial reasoning and generates robotic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of our SoFar, e.g., zero-shot 48.7% successful rate on Open6DOR and zero-shot 74.9% successful rate on SIMPLER-Env.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Chao Gao, Yankai Wang, Defu Lian, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world information-seeking scenarios, users have dynamic and diverse needs, requiring RAG systems to demonstrate adaptable resilience. To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs.
  Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation.
  HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Liu, Taekyu Kang, Haoyu Wang, Seyed Hossein Alavi, Vered Shwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating diverse follow-up questions that uncover missing information remains challenging for conversational agents, particularly when they run on small, locally hosted models. To address this, we develop an information-gap-driven knowledge distillation pipeline in which a teacher LLM generates a comprehensive answer, contrasts it with the initial answer to identify information gaps, and formulates gap-bridging follow-up questions. Using this pipeline, we augment the existing FollowupQG dataset tenfold. We then fine-tune smaller student models on the augmented dataset to distill the teacher's knowledge. Experiments with selected teacher-student model pairs show that fine-tuned students achieve significantly higher informativeness and diversity than variations trained on the original dataset. These findings indicate that our pipeline, which mirrors the human cognitive process of information seeking, provides an efficient distillation channel from state-of-the-art LLMs to smaller models, enabling resource-constrained conversational systems to generate more diverse and informative follow-up questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Somma, Thomas Gallien, Branka Stojanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derin Ozer, Sylvain Lamprier, Thomas Cauchy, Nicolas Gutowski, Benoit Da Mota</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a set featuring 20 generic reaction templates written in SMARTS, a pattern-based notation designed to describe substructures and reactivity. Additionally, we introduce ProPreT5, a T5-based model specifically adapted for chemistry and, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of directly handling and applying SMARTS reaction templates. To further improve generalization, we propose the first augmentation strategy for SMARTS, which injects structural diversity at the pattern level. Trained on augmented templates, ProPreT5 demonstrates strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen reactions. Together, these contributions provide a novel and practical alternative to current methods, advancing the field of template-based reaction prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Sonmez, Hanna Krasowski, Murat Arcak</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we study a data augmentation strategy that leverages the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured by the AV's sensors, as additional demonstrations. We introduce a simple vehicle-selection sampling and filtering strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer dataset for training. We evaluate this idea with a representative learning-based planner on a large real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, the approach reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10 percent of the original dataset, the method matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset. Through ablations, we analyze selection criteria and show that naive random selection can degrade performance. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Song, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". By using general tasks, controlling for model similarity, and evaluating a wide range of open-source models, we show that LLMs cannot introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Zhang, Yun Xiong, Yateng Tang, Jiarong Xu, Xi Chen, Zehao Gu, Xuezheng Hao, Zian Jia, Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and wearable devices, egocentric vision understanding has emerged as a new and challenging research direction, gradually attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. Egocentric vision captures visual and multimodal data through cameras or sensors worn on the human body, offering a unique perspective that simulates human visual experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research on egocentric vision understanding, systematically analyzing the components of egocentric scenes and categorizing the tasks into four main areas: subject understanding, object understanding, environment understanding, and hybrid understanding. We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research. By summarizing the latest advancements, we anticipate the broad applications of egocentric vision technologies in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence, and propose future research directions based on the latest developments in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xintong Wang, Haihan Nan, Ruidong Li, Huaming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating nonlinear audio effects without access to paired input-output signals remains a challenging problem. This work studies unsupervised probabilistic approaches for solving this task. We introduce a method, novel for this application, based on diffusion generative models for blind system identification, enabling the estimation of unknown nonlinear effects using black- and gray-box models. This study compares this method with a previously proposed adversarial approach, analyzing the performance of both methods under different parameterizations of the effect operator and varying lengths of available effected recordings. Through experiments on guitar distortion effects, we show that the diffusion-based approach provides more stable results and is less sensitive to data availability, while the adversarial approach is superior at estimating more pronounced distortion effects. Our findings contribute to the robust unsupervised blind estimation of audio effects, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models for system identification in music technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Ruiyi Zhang, Jian Chen, Chenguang Wang, Jiuxiang Gu, Yufan Zhou, Franck Dernoncourt, Wanrong Zhu, Tianyi Zhou, Tong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</p>

We introduce LEMUR, an open-source dataset and framework that provides a large collection of PyTorch-based neural networks across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and natural language processing. Each model follows a unified template, with configurations and results stored in a structured database to ensure consistency and reproducibility. LEMUR integrates automated hyperparameter optimization via Optuna, includes statistical analysis and visualization tools, and offers an API for seamless access to performance data. The framework is extensible, allowing researchers to add new models, datasets, or metrics without breaking compatibility. By standardizing implementations and unifying evaluation, LEMUR aims to accelerate AutoML research, enable fair benchmarking, and reduce barriers to large-scale neural network experimentation. To support adoption and collaboration, LEMUR and its plugins are released under the MIT license at: https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-plots https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-vr</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lovedeep Gondara, Jonathan Simkin, Graham Sayle, Shebnum Devji, Gregory Arbour, Raymond Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Xiang, Ke Li, Mingquan Liu, Zhixiang Cheng, Bin Yao, Wenjie Du, Jun Xia, Li Zeng, Xin Jin, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Chen, Xiaopeng Li, Ziniu Li, Xi Chen, Tianyi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giyeong Oh, Woohyun Cho, Siyeol Kim, Suhwan Choi, Younjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingli Shen, Wen Lai, Shuo Wang, Ge Gao, Kangyang Luo, Alexander Fraser, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Jing Zhu, Shengyi Qian, Zhuokai Zhao, Xiyao Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Ming Li, Paiheng Xu, Wei Ai, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups, assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gagan Bhatia, Maxime Peyrard, Wei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

<p>Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Dong, Moru Liu, Jian Liang, Eleni Chatzi, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangrui Pan, Qingchun Liang, Shen Zhao, Songqing Fan, Shaoliang Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Babak Barazandeh, Subhabrata Majumdar, Om Rajyaguru, George Michailidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihan Jin, Pengpeng Shao, Zhengqi Wen, Jinyang Wu, Mingkuan Feng, Shuai Zhang, Jianhua Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Lu, Ethan Weinberger, Chanwoo Kim, Su-In Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is vital for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, yet challenges remain due to data scarcity and limited uncertainty awareness. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification with transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. We benchmark several pre-trained feature extractors -- including CLIP variants, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and EfficientNet-V2-Large -- combined with traditional classifiers such as SVM, XGBoost, and logistic regression. Multiple principal component analysis (PCA) settings (64, 128, 256, 512) are explored, with LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/14 at PCA-256 achieving the strongest baseline results. In the UQ phase, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) are applied and evaluated using uncertainty-aware metrics (UAcc, USen, USpe, UPre). Ensemble methods with PCA-256 provide the best balance between accuracy and reliability. Further improvements are obtained through feature fusion of top-performing extractors at PCA-256. Finally, we propose a feature-fusion based model trained with a predictive entropy (PE) loss function, which outperforms all prior configurations across both standard and uncertainty-aware evaluations, advancing trustworthy DL-based skin cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting-Yun Chang, Muru Zhang, Jesse Thomason, Robin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is critical for surgical training and robotic decision-making in robot-assisted surgery. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great potential for advancing scene perception in the medical domain, facilitating surgeons to understand surgical scenes and procedures. However, these methods are primarily oriented towards image-based analysis or global video understanding, overlooking the fine-grained video reasoning that is crucial for analyzing specific processes and capturing detailed task execution within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K that is a large-scale dataset with over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Building on this resource, SurgVidLM incorporates a two-stage StageFocus mechanism: the first stage extracts global procedural context, while the second stage performs high-frequency local analysis guided by temporal cues. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low- and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the preservation of critical task-specific details. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs of comparable parameter scale in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing the context of complex robot-assisted surgeries. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Li, Chuan Wang, Hongdong Zhu, Qi Gao, Yin Ma, Hai Wei, Kai Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. We further propose a training algorithm with single-sample bit-scale optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Agia, Rohan Sinha, Jingyun Yang, Rika Antonova, Marco Pavone, Haruki Nishimura, Masha Itkina, Jeannette Bohg</p>
<p>Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Toufique Hasan, Muhammad Waseem, Kai-Kristian Kemell, Ayman Asad Khan, Mika Saari, Pekka Abrahamsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Rydin, Attila Lischka, Jiaming Wu, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani, Bal\'azs Kulcs\'ar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397">HAZEMATCHING: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Ray,  Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujia Wang, Yunjia Qi, Bin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available at https://github.com/KlozeWang/LoSiA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Ye, Yang Zhang, Wentao Shi, Xiaoyu You, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialong Mai, Xiaofen Xing, Yawei Li, Weidong Chen, Zhipeng Li, Jingyuan Xing, Xiangmin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Jin, Zhenhao Shuai, Zihan Hu, Weiteng Zhang, Weihao Xie, Jianwei Shuai, Xian Shen, Zhen Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and Aims: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities by learning from vast corpora of text and web data. Their semantic representations allow cross-task knowledge transfer and reasoning, offering promising opportunities for data-scarce and heterogeneous domains such as clinical medicine. Yet, in diagnostic tasks like sarcopenia, major challenges remain: interpretability, transparency, and deployment efficiency. Traditional machine learning (TML) models provide stable performance and feature-level attribution, ensuring traceable and auditable decision logic, but lack semantic breadth. Conversely, LLMs enable flexible inference but often function as opaque predictors. Existing integration strategies remain shallow, rarely embedding the structured reasoning of TML into LLM inference. Methods: Using sarcopenia diagnosis as a case study, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were extracted from a baseline XGBoost model and transformed into structured, LLM-compatible representations. An actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) strategy guided the LLM to reason over these SHAP-based inputs, producing calibrated rationales and refined decision rules. The distilled reasoning was consolidated into a structured knowledge repository and deployed via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for case-based inference. Results: (Omitted here.) Conclusion: By coupling SHAP-derived statistical evidence with reinforcement-trained LLM reasoning, CANDLE mitigates the interpretability-performance trade-off, enhances predictive accuracy, and preserves high decision consistency. The framework offers a scalable approach to knowledge assetization of TML models, enabling interpretable, reproducible, and clinically aligned decision support in sarcopenia and potentially broader medical domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Xuxiang Tian, Ruofan Zhang, Janet Tang, Ji Wang, Tianyu Shi, Jiaxin Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which can autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LMs in chatbots or simple tool use. To more comprehensively evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking data, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox with rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), beyond refusal rates. We evaluate frontier LMs including GPT-5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Even without jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 90\% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, while newer models are safer in previous safety benchmarks, their misuse risks as CUAs become even higher, e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro is riskier than Gemini 1.5 Pro. Additionally, while these LMs are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) when acting as chatbots, they could still act unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. To mitigate the misuse risks of CUAs, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions. We find monitoring unsafe computer-using actions is significantly harder than monitoring conventional unsafe chatbot responses. While monitoring chain-of-thoughts leads to modest gains, the average monitoring accuracy is only 77\%. A hierarchical summarization strategy improves performance by up to 13\%, a promising direction though monitoring remains unreliable. The benchmark will be released publicly to facilitate further research on mitigating these risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a hybrid adapter that combines Kronecker-structured factorization with low-rank LoRA compression-an integration that, to our knowledge, has not been explored in parameter-efficient fine-tuning or in matrix approximation literature. Kron-LoRA achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer parameters than standard LoRA while retaining similar expressivity. Experiments on DistilBERT, Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-3-8B across eight benchmarks show that Kron-LoRA matches or exceeds LoRA baselines with modest memory savings and only a 5-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning, it also delivers competitive cross-task transfer despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters. Kron-LoRA thus offers a scalable, sustainable solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jennifer Wang, Kayla Huang, Kevin Klyman, Rishi Bommasani</p>
<p>Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7, from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the average score across all companies is just 53%. The companies demonstrate systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI governance initiatives worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Chen, Qingqing Long, Meng Xiao, Xiao Luo, Wei Ju, Chengrui Wang, Xuezhi Wang, Yuanchun Zhou, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijie Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Hao Tang, Jianjun Qian, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Makridis, George Fragiadakis, Jorge Oliveira, Tomaz Saraiva, Philip Mavrepis, Georgios Fatouros, Dimosthenis Kyriazis</p>
<p>Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed, sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy, enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions, with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for future real-world validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senhao Liu, Zhiyu Guo, Zhiyuan Ji, Yueguo Chen, Yateng Tang, Yunhai Wang, Xuehao Zheng, Xiang Ao</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately. This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mujie Liu, Chenze Wang, Liping Chen, Nguyen Linh Dan Le, Niharika Tewari, Ting Dang, Jiangang Ma, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxi Lu, Jiabo Ye, Fei Tang, Yongliang Shen, Haiyang Xu, Ziwei Zheng, Weiming Lu, Ming Yan, Fei Huang, Jun Xiao, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wang, Xiaofei Xie, Qiang Hu, Shangqing Liu, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images, users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor, a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive, refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Yang, Aonan Zhang, Hong Liu, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Emmanuel Cand\`es, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM) pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter model on up to 1T tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition baseline and delivers a significant fraction of performance improvement attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data. Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance, SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mobina Noori, Mahasweta Chakraborti, Amy X Zhang, Seth Frey</p>
<p>Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions GOVERNANCE.md. With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.</p>

We propose CP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating speech-LLMs on contextual paralinguistic reasoning the integration of verbal content with non-verbal cues like emotion and prosody. The benchmark includes two curated question answering (QA) datasets requiring both linguistic and empathetic understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art speech-LLMs from both open and closed-source models and perform a comprehensive analysis across different question types. The top two models were further analyzed under temperature tuning to understand its effect on this task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Li, Yu Zhu, Yichen Qiao, Ziyu Guan, Lv Shao, Tong Liu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-ranking stage in industrial recommendation systems faces a fundamental conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. While powerful models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization. This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and yielding substantial business improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Zhang, Wanlong Fang, Jonathan Woo, Paridhi Latawa, Deepak A. Subramanian, Alvin Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Weng, Han Zheng, Hanyu Zhang, Qinqin He, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Zhixuan Chu, Xiting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to address broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related concepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regulations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we propose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron explanations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazheng Kang, Le Huang, Cheng Hou, Zhe Zhao, Zhenxiang Yan, Chuan Shi, Ting Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chinese Patronizing and Condescending Language (CPCL) is an implicitly discriminatory toxic speech targeting vulnerable groups on Chinese video platforms. The existing dataset lacks user comments, which are a direct reflection of video content. This undermines the model's understanding of video content and results in the failure to detect some CPLC videos. To make up for this loss, this research reconstructs a new dataset PCLMMPLUS that includes 103k comment entries and expands the dataset size. We also propose the CPCLDetector model with alignment selection and knowledge-enhanced comment content modules. Extensive experiments show the proposed CPCLDetector outperforms the SOTA on PCLMM and achieves higher performance on PCLMMPLUS . CPLC videos are detected more accurately, supporting content governance and protecting vulnerable groups. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/jiaxunyang256/PCLD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies have been widely used in robot manipulation, where both visual observations and proprioceptive states are typically adopted together for precise control. However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0% to 85% in height generalization and from 6% to 64% in horizontal generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Liu, Xinyuan Shi, Xiaondan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingming Zheng, Hanqi Li, Kai Yu, Lu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Wang, Jun Zhao, Xinyi Liu, Yanbo Liu, Xuyang Cao, Chao Li, Zhuoyun Liu, Qintian Sun, Fangru Zhou, Haoqiang Xing, Zhenhong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natasha Butt, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19277">MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurofibromas in whole-body MRI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Kolokolnikov, Marie-Lena Schmalhofer, Sophie Goetz, Lennart Well, Said Farschtschi, Victor-Felix Mautner, Inka Ristow, Rene Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.</p>
