<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Camlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone, formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and self-representation is visual-silent ($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy $\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\ A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer, $\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the highest intelligent good.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Tien Huang, Dzung Dinh, Junier B. Oliva</p>
<p>Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which, at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18391">PKG-DPO: Optimizing Domain-Specific AI systems with Physics Knowledge Graphs and Direct Preference Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni, Bryson Wilcox, Max Sawa, Jason Thom</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science, and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining, the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints into preference learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivia Long, Carter Teplica</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks, they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact. However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions: models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings, telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment, our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents "unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase or decrease cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dillon Z. Chen, Johannes Zenn, Tristan Cinquin, Sheila A. McIlraith</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1 o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dillon Z. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant correlation between training and planning metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dillon Z. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijie Xu, Clark Verbrugge</p>
<p>Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable, training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information, Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion. Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard behaviors.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533">A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijie Xu, Clark Verbrugge</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular, database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay progression.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18554">SchemaCoder: Automatic Log Schema Extraction Coder with Residual Q-Tree Boosting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lily Jiaxin Wan, Chia-Tung Ho, Rongjian Liang, Cunxi Yu, Deming Chen, Haoxing Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction. However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions, necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains. To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark, achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janet Wang, Xin Hu, Yunbei Zhang, Diabate Almamy, Vagamon Bamba, Konan Amos S\'ebastien Koffi, Yao Koffi Aubin, Zhengming Ding, Jihun Hamm, Rie R. Yotsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from 1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels, eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global dermatology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxing Liao, Tian Zhang, Xiao Feng, Yusong Zhang, Rui Yang, Haorui Wang, Bosi Wen, Ziying Wang, Runzhi Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality (72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of 200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Zhao, Xili Wang, Chengdi Ma, Lingbin Kong, Zhaohua Yang, Mingxiang Tuo, Xiaowei Shi, Yitao Zhai, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions. Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure 1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2 Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a profound impact on human society.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghao Fu, Junlong Ren, Qi Chai, Deheng Ye, Yujun Cai, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless, their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge. Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs while enhancing agent performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karanbir Singh, Deepak Muppiri, William Ngu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However, they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunguk Choi, Yonghoon Kwon, Heondeuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18749">Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization Integrating TextGrad-style Prompt Optimization with Memory-Driven Self-Evolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunlong Wu, Zhibo Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module - structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer, implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies. This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode - without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byung-Joon Lee, Jin-Seop Lee, Jee-Hyong Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However, the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP), which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Xiangyu Liu, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units (MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be available at https://github.com/Fanye12/DDS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Chai, Zhang Zheng, Junlong Ren, Deheng Ye, Zichuan Lin, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution. Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE, a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Wu, Ruiyang Ren, Junjie Zhang, Ruirui Wang, Zhongrui Ma, Qi Ye, Wayne Xin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite using only 0.4% of the full training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eljas Linna, Tuula Linna</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains, yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood. This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like "reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated "sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Rontogiannis, Maxime Peyrard, Nicolas Baldwin, Martin Josifoski, Robert West, Dimitrios Gunopulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured, feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxing Huang, Xinling Jin, Sijie Liang, Peng Li, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named \textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by 4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof) with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%) and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Xiao, Conn Breathnach, Ioana Ghergulescu, Conor O'Sullivan, Keith Johnston, Vincent Wade</p>
<p>Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Egea, Barproda Halder, Sanghamitra Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset. Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to 97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20 vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I. I. Priezzhev, D. A. Danko, A. V. Shubin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query. Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer, while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pontus Strimling, Simon Karlsson, Irina Vartanova, Kimmo Eriksson</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7% of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment, agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of context engineering in advancing AGI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients' life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data). Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient (0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Surajit Das, Gourav Roy, Aleksei Eliseev, Ram Kumar Rajendran</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential. Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii) variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability, supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congchi Yin, Tianyi Wu, Yankai Shu, Alex Gu, Yunhan Wang, Jun Shao, Xun Jiang, Piji Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm, \textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs. LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle} benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19 modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over 70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies for hypothesis refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Norihiro Maruyama, Takahide Yoshida, Hiroki Sato, Atsushi Masumori,  Johnsmith, Takashi Ikegami</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues for artificial intelligence research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Yang, Zhaoxin Fan, Gen Li, Yuanze Hu, Xinyu Wang, Ye Qiu, Xin Wang, Yifan Sun, Wenjun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction, while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongwoo Song, Minbyul Jeong, Mujeen Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However, deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when confidence is low.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures. The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective partners in clinical practice and medical research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19113">Hybrid Deep Searcher: Integrating Parallel and Sequential Search Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayoon Ko, Jihyuk Kim, Haeju Park, Sohyeon Kim, Dahyun Lee, Yongrae Jo, Gunhee Kim, Moontae Lee, Kyungjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions, explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9 and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid parallel and sequential querying.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Battiloro, Pietro Greiner, Bret Nestor, Oumaima Amezgar, Francesca Dominici</p>
<p>Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design. Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals, i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives' sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with multiple collectives.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152">Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiu-Chou Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ernest Lim, Yajie Vera He, Jared Joselowitz, Kate Preston, Mohita Chowdhury, Louis Williams, Aisling Higham, Katrina Mason, Mariane Melo, Tom Lawton, Yan Jia, Ibrahim Habli</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured scenarios, and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xiong, Wenting Zhao, Weizhe Yuan, Olga Golovneva, Tong Zhang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</p>
<p>Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems, where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies, (b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem. Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar -- a set of 12 choreographed poses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities, object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$, $3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English (AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44 peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation, annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing, our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to address language marginalization in speech AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saksham Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems, where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement. In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy instead of just a black-box program.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Salman Shaukat, Yannik K\"ackenmeister, Sebastian Bader, Thomas Kirste</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments where traditional machine learning approaches fail.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols, MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of 98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huangyu Dai, Lingtao Mao, Ben Chen, Zihan Wang, Zihan Liang, Ying Han, Chenyi Lei, Han Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment. This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate (PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new direction for hotword customization in ASR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edgar Rangel, Fabio Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging (DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics, scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However, these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm 0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm 0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties, showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Ashok, Ashutosh Chaubey, Hirona J. Arai, Jonathan May, Jesse Thomason</p>
<p>Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic, detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we provide informed recommendations for future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gohar Irfan Chaudhry, Esha Choukse, Haoran Qiu, \'I\~nigo Goiri, Rodrigo Fonseca, Adam Belay, Ricardo Bianchini</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy, latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by 4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.</p>

<p>Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuchao Liu, Han Peng, Wengen Li, Yichao Zhang, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity, diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \& development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously, scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuxinlin Cheng, Yupeng Cao, Jinwen Wu, Koduvayur Subbalakshmi, Tian Han, Zhuo Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Amballa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned positional encodings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Pan, Zhongze Cai, Guanting Chen, Huaiyang Zhong, Chonghuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Cai, Yu Liu, Zhiyao Luo, Tingting Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source. Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment, we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore, ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to aid in healthcare prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources. Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However, AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns. Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet, MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67% precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.</p>

<p>Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing. The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model more?" are unaffected by the method used.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the robustness to social influence compared to Base models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangfeng Sun, Sihao He, Zhonghong Ou, Meina Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator'' aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off. Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a. `budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage. Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs' input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to 3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both answer formats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Guillen-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Hare, Ying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems, meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer' agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal \v{S}tef\'anik, Timothee Mickus, Marek Kadl\v{c}\'ik, Michal Spiegel, Josef Kucha\v{r}</p>
<p>Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Borsoi, Konstantin Usevich, Marianne Clausel</p>
<p>Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aranya Saha, Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Ismam Nur Swapnil, Mohammad Ariful Haque</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering (VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an 18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anders M{\o}lmen H{\o}st, Pierre Lison, Leon Moonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars Nieradzik</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12 percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0 requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce \emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric, combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0, and the benchmark framework at https://github.com/lars76/pitch-benchmark.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444">How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nafis Tanveer Islam, Zhiming Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking, which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead, abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Teng, Miao Pan, Xuhong Zhang, Zhezhi He, Yiyao Yang, Xinyi Chai, Mengnan Qi, Liqiang Lu, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Guo, Ziwen Pan, Alex Khan, Jan Balewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahareh Golchin, Banafsheh Rekabdar, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Lochner, Keegan Keplinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model (Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.</p>

In this work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models. Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone. On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries, enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000 unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of our model and strong generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tasmia Shahriar, Mia Ameen, Aditi Mallavarapu, Shiyan Jiang, Noboru Matsuda</p>
<p>Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments, students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other. This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher conceptual and procedural learning gain.</p>

<p>Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem, stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI, cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Ghaffarzadeh-Esfahani, Ali Motahharynia, Nahid Yousefian, Navid Mazrouei, Jafar Ghaisari, Yousof Gheisari</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bar{\i}\c{s} Bayaz{\i}t, Yao Li, Xujie Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but can also make odd mistakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al. (2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very different means.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Zhou, Pengfei Cao, Jiang Li, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxuan Miao, Yutong Feng, Jianshu Zeng, Zixiang Gao, Hantang Liu, Yunfeng Yan, Donglian Qi, Xi Chen, Bin Wang, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Wang, Xinyi Hou, Yanjie Zhao, Weiguo Lin, Haoyu Wang, Junjun Si</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment. Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanxi Li, Zhengyue Zhao, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90% improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Yang, Qingyi Si, Zheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoliang Chen, Xin Yu, Le Chang, Teng Jing, Jiashuai He, Ze Wang, Yangjun Luo, Xingyu Chen, Jiayue Liang, Yuchen Wang, Jiaying Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours), we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Hu, Yinglei Teng, Pengfei Wu, Nan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts, enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuechun Gu, Jiajie He, Keke Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However, recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples' privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA, utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taishi Nakamura, Satoki Ishikawa, Masaki Kawamura, Takumi Okamoto, Daisuke Nohara, Jun Suzuki, Rio Yokota</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap. Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss. Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant, and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models.

<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages. We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions.

In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Xiao, Yingshan Peng, PeiPei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus single-speaker fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DongHoon Lim, YoungChae Kim, Dong-Hyun Kim, Da-Hee Yang, Joon-Hyuk Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afan Ali, Irfanullah Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust, present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model. Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and scalable solution to secure NTNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrique M\'armol Campos, Aurora Gonz\'alez Vidal, Jos\'e Luis Hern\'andez Ramos, Antonio Skarmeta</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liang, Ying Shen, Tiantian Chen, Lin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, Jacky Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for future development in GEC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroto Sakimura, Takayuki Nagaya, Tomoki Nishi, Tetsuo Kurahashi, Katsunori Kohda, Nobuhiko Muramoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes. This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals -- including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24 participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on 1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations. EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited, these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.</p>

In this paper, we present insights from a design thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop, participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified framework for electromagnetic intelligence.

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities, transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) community. With advancements in deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and edge computing, CETCI has made significant progress with emerging AIoT applications, moving beyond isolated layer optimization to deployable collaborative intelligence systems for AIoT (CISAIOT), a practical research focus in AI, distributed computing, and communications. This survey describes foundational architectures, enabling technologies, and scenarios of CETCI paradigms, offering a tutorial-style review for CISAIOT beginners. We systematically analyze architectural components spanning cloud, edge, and terminal layers, examining core technologies including network virtualization, container orchestration, and software-defined networking, while presenting categorizations of collaboration paradigms that cover task offloading, resource allocation, and optimization across heterogeneous infrastructures. Furthermore, we explain intelligent collaboration learning frameworks by reviewing advances in federated learning, distributed deep learning, edge-cloud model evolution, and reinforcement learning-based methods. Finally, we discuss challenges (e.g., scalability, heterogeneity, interoperability) and future trends (e.g., 6G+, agents, quantum computing, digital twin), highlighting how integration of distributed computing and communication can address open issues and guide development of robust, efficient, and secure collaborative AIoT systems.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18847">ConfTuner: Training Large Language Models to Express Their Confidence Verbally</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Li, Miao Xiong, Jiaying Wu, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs' verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates, both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function, tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy LLM systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Luo, Zihan Liu, Yangjie Zhou, Shihan Fang, Ziyu Huang, Yu Feng, Chen Zhang, Shixuan Sun, Zhenzhe Zheng, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations.

<p>Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches, thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Agrawal, Nisharg Nargund, Oishani Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873 vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs). Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient, and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time series research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishwarya Venkataramanan, Joachim Denzler</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in- from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across regression and classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ridwan Arefeen, Xiaoxiao Miao, Rong Tong, Aik Beng Ng, Simon See</p>
<p>Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems. SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out of seven systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Xu, Jianhao Zhu, Jingwen Xu, Changze Lv, Zisu Huang, Xiaohua Wang, Muling Wu, Qi Qian, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP). This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global, cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods, excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Driouich, Hongliu Cao, Eoin Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Contini, Victor Illien, Sylvain Poulain, Serge Bernard, Julien Barde, Sylvain Bonhommeau, Alexis Joly</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge, essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts. While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Kreuzer, Jelena Zdravkovic, Panagiotis Papapetrou</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition, and symbolic reasoning in neural models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for text classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12% across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective non-gradient approaches in autoprompting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g., GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic, workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19003">RoofSeg: An edge-aware transformer-based network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan You, Guozheng Xu, Pengwei Zhou, Qiwen Jin, Jian Yao, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low, leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network, named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition, we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss to constrain the network training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gary Simethy, Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo, Petar Durdevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p>

Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets, including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for threat intelligence and cyber defense.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability. Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

<p>Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.</p>

By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy, adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive, adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries. An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures robust final predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZhenDong Chen, ZhanShang Nie, ShiXing Wan, JunYi Li, YongTian Cheng, Shuai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex, long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of its hierarchical components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Ma, Chao Fang, Haikuo Shao, Zhongfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however, attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM. Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication (MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Lee, Ali Arastehfard, Weiran Liu, Xuegang Ban, Yuan Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation. These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable, multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires $143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems. Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Gummadi, Mateus V. Gasparino, Gianluca Capezzuto, Marcelo Becker, Girish Chowdhary</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, constantly reaching the final goal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Yi Wen, Wei Li, Junchao Liu, Yong Guo, Jie Hu, Xinghao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data. While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Sterzinger, Tingyu Lin, Robert Sablatnig</p>
<p>Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy of our approach.

<p>Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Chandler, Bernd Porr, Giulia Lafratta, Alice Miller</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents. This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Wu, Matthew Barthet, David Melhart, Georgios N. Yannakakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces. Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19201">Understanding Tool-Integrated Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Lin, Zhongwen Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models (LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support, breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool. Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and how they enable more powerful reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Ost, Andrea Ramazzina, Amogh Joshi, Maximilian B\"omer, Mario Bijelic, Felix Heide</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.</p>

The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational ``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchi Liu, Ruijie Tao, Qiongqiong Wang, Yidi Jiang, Hardik B. Sailor, Ke Zhang, Jingru Lin, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However, collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE (Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\% relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification, where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable addition to existing training pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Chen, Yanzhe Zhang, Yutong Zhang, Yijia Shao, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.</p>

This is especially true when the goal is to model the interplay between different aspects in a causal fashion. Indeed, causal inference itself is specifically designed to quantify the underlying relationships that connect a cause to its effect. Causal discovery is a branch of the broader field of causality in which causal graphs are recovered from data (whenever possible), enabling the identification and estimation of causal effects. In this paper, we explore recent advancements in causal discovery in a unified manner, provide a consistent overview of existing algorithms developed under different settings, report useful tools and data, present real-world applications to understand why and how these methods can be fruitfully exploited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyu Ban, Lyuzhou Chen, Derui Lyu, Xiangyu Wang, Qinrui Zhu, Qiang Tu, Huanhuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering the structure of causal graphical models from observational data is an essential yet challenging task for causal discovery in scientific scenarios. Domain-specific causal discovery usually relies on expert validation or prior analysis to improve the reliability of recovered causality, which is yet limited by the scarcity of expert resources. Recently, Large Language Models (LLM) have been used for causal analysis across various domain-specific scenarios, suggesting its potential as autonomous expert roles in guiding data-based structure learning. However, integrating LLMs into causal discovery faces challenges due to inaccuracies in LLM-based reasoning on revealing the actual causal structure. To address this challenge, we propose an error-tolerant LLM-driven causal discovery framework. The error-tolerant mechanism is designed three-fold with sufficient consideration on potential inaccuracies. In the LLM-based reasoning process, an accuracy-oriented prompting strategy restricts causal analysis to a reliable range. Next, a knowledge-to-structure transition aligns LLM-derived causal statements with structural causal interactions. In the structure learning process, the goodness-of-fit to data and adherence to LLM-derived priors are balanced to further address prior inaccuracies. Evaluation of eight real-world causal structures demonstrates the efficacy of our LLM-driven approach in improving data-based causal discovery, along with its robustness to inaccurate LLM-derived priors.

When prior knowledge of the domain or task is unavailable, training RL agents in unknown, black-box environments presents an even greater safety risk. We introduce ADVICE (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, and uses this knowledge to protect the RL agent from executing actions that yield likely hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques shows that ADVICE significantly reduces safety violations (approx 50%) during training, with a competitive outcome reward compared to other techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust POMDPs extend classical POMDPs to incorporate model uncertainty using so-called uncertainty sets on the transition and observation functions, effectively defining ranges of probabilities. Policies for robust POMDPs must be (1) memory-based to account for partial observability and (2) robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets. To compute such robust memory-based policies, we propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which alternates between (1) selecting pessimistic POMDPs via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets, and (2) computing finite-state controllers (FSCs) for these pessimistic POMDPs. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm, which optimizes a recurrent neural network to compute the FSCs. The empirical evaluation shows that rFSCNet can compute better-performing robust policies than several baselines and a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqi Duan, Yao Cheng, Jianxiang Yu, Yao Liu, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Polina Gordienko, Christoph Jansen, Thomas Augustin, Martin Rechenauer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for probability aggregation based on propositional probability logic. Unlike conventional judgment aggregation, which focuses on static rationality, our model addresses dynamic rationality by ensuring that collective beliefs update consistently with new information. We show that any consensus-compatible and independent aggregation rule on a non-nested agenda is necessarily linear. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for a fair learning process, where individuals initially agree on a specified subset of propositions known as the common ground, and new information is restricted to this shared foundation. This guarantees that updating individual judgments via Bayesian conditioning-whether performed before or after aggregation-yields the same collective belief. A distinctive feature of our framework is its treatment of sequential decision-making, which allows new information to be incorporated progressively through multiple stages while maintaining the established common ground. We illustrate our findings with a running example in a political scenario concerning healthcare and immigration policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Heyang Gao, Xiaohe Bo, Xu Chen, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging large language model (LLM) based agents to simulate human social behaviors has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50 default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics, sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3) Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic, and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the performance of the AI social researcher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vince Trencsenyi, Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Lyu, Dandan Zhang, Wei Ye, Fangdi Li, Zhihang Jiang, Yao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is at https://zesen01.github.io/jigsaw-puzzles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan-Wei Hu, Yueqi Wang, Shuo Xing, Chia-Ju Chen, Suofei Feng, Ryan Rossi, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karishma Thakrar, Shreyas Basavatia, Akshay Daftardar</p>
<p>Abstract: Dermatological care via telemedicine often lacks the rich context of in-person visits. Clinicians must make diagnoses based on a handful of images and brief descriptions, without the benefit of physical exams, second opinions, or reference materials. While many medical AI systems attempt to bridge these gaps with domain-specific fine-tuning, this work hypothesized that mimicking clinical reasoning processes could offer a more effective path forward. This study tested seven vision-language models on medical visual question answering across six configurations: baseline models, fine-tuned variants, and both augmented with either reasoning layers that combine multiple model perspectives, analogous to peer consultation, or retrieval-augmented generation that incorporates medical literature at inference time, serving a role similar to reference-checking. While fine-tuning degraded performance in four of seven models with an average 30% decrease, baseline models collapsed on test data. Clinical-inspired architectures, meanwhile, achieved up to 70% accuracy, maintaining performance on unseen data while generating explainable, literature-grounded outputs critical for clinical adoption. These findings demonstrate that medical AI succeeds by reconstructing the collaborative and evidence-based practices fundamental to clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Courtney Ford, Mark T. Keane</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications, FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Yamani, Malak Baslyman, Moataz Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitian Xie, Qintong Wu, Chengyue Yu, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex real-world problems. However, this reliance introduces new challenges, as extended contexts and noisy tool outputs can undermine system reliability. To address this, we propose a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) in our AWorld framework, where an Execution Agent is supervised by a Guard Agent that provides on-demand dynamic maneuvering, verifying and correcting the reasoning process to improve robustness over single-agent systems. To move beyond this generic supervision, we enhance the architecture with a methodology inspired by System Identification from control theory. This method first profiles the Execution Agent offline on a benchmark dataset to create a "performance fingerprint" of its unique weaknesses. The Guard Agent then leverages this fingerprint online to deliver profile-aware supervision, making targeted interventions based on known failure patterns rather than merely reacting to immediate logical flaws. Extensive experiments on the GAIA dataset demonstrate that this profile-aware MAS significantly improves both effectiveness and stability, outperforming not only single-agent systems but also its naive counterpart. This superior performance led our system to achieve first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findings highlight that building truly trustworthy intelligent systems requires not just collaboration, but a deep, empirically-grounded understanding of each agent's unique capabilities and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Rath, Stuart Armstrong, Rebecca Gorman</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging reports of the harms caused to children and adults by AI sycophancy and by parasocial ties with chatbots point to an urgent need for safeguards against such risks. Yet, preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations between chatbots and users, and we lack effective methods to mitigate these risks. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation framework (an AI chaperone agent) created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model to evaluate ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. We constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five-stage testing successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that AI chaperones can be a viable solution for reducing the risk of parasocial relationships.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Vassef, Soorya Ram Shimegekar, Abhay Goyal, Koustuv Saha, Pi Zonooz, Navin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First (Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i) stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection (with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Tang, Boyu Niu, Xuanhe Zhou, Boxiu Li, Wei Zhou, Jiannan Wang, Guoliang Li, Xinyi Zhang, Fan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kento Tomita, Katherine A. Skinner, Koki Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Hazard detection is critical for enabling autonomous landing on planetary surfaces. Current state-of-the-art methods leverage traditional computer vision approaches to automate the identification of safe terrain from input digital elevation models (DEMs). However, performance for these methods can degrade for input DEMs with increased sensor noise. In the last decade, deep learning techniques have been developed for various applications. Nevertheless, their applicability to safety-critical space missions has often been limited due to concerns regarding their outputs' reliability. In response to these limitations, this paper proposes an application of the Bayesian deep-learning segmentation method for hazard detection. The developed approach enables reliable, safe landing site detection by: (i) generating simultaneously a safety prediction map and its uncertainty map via Bayesian deep learning and semantic segmentation; and (ii) using the uncertainty map to filter out the uncertain pixels in the prediction map so that the safe site identification is performed only based on the certain pixels (i.e., pixels for which the model is certain about its safety prediction). Experiments are presented with simulated data based on a Mars HiRISE digital terrain model by varying uncertainty threshold and noise levels to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Du, Subramanian Ramamoorthy, Wouter Duivesteijn, Jin Tian, Mykola Pechenizkiy</p>
<p>Abstract: Local decision rules are commonly understood to be more explainable, due to the local nature of the patterns involved. With numerical optimization methods such as gradient boosting, ensembles of local decision rules can gain good predictive performance on data involving global structure. Meanwhile, machine learning models are being increasingly used to solve problems in high-stake domains including healthcare and finance. Here, there is an emerging consensus regarding the need for practitioners to understand whether and how those models could perform robustly in the deployment environments, in the presence of distributional shifts. Past research on local decision rules has focused mainly on maximizing discriminant patterns, without due consideration of robustness against distributional shifts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new method to learn and ensemble local decision rules, that are robust both in the training and deployment environments. Specifically, we propose to leverage causal knowledge by regarding the distributional shifts in subpopulations and deployment environments as the results of interventions on the underlying system. We propose two regularization terms based on causal knowledge to search for optimal and stable rules. Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets show that our method is effective and robust against distributional shifts in multiple environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we aim to enhance the capabilities of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models by integrating diverse modalities beyond textual descriptions within a unified framework. To this end, we categorize widely used conditional inputs into three modality types: structure, layout, and attribute. We propose a multimodal T2I diffusion model, which is capable of processing all three modalities within a single architecture without modifying the parameters of the pre-trained diffusion model, as only a small subset of components is updated. Our approach sets new benchmarks in multimodal generation through extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing conditional generation methods. We demonstrate that DiffBlender effectively integrates multiple sources of information and supports diverse applications in detailed image synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Wang, Jiashuo Liu, Peng Cui, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Different distribution shifts require different interventions, and algorithms must be grounded in the specific shifts they address. However, methodological development for robust algorithms typically relies on structural assumptions that lack empirical validation. Advocating for an empirically grounded data-driven approach to algorithm development, we build an empirical testbed comprising natural shifts across 8 tabular datasets, 172 distribution pairs over 45 methods and 90,000 method configurations encompassing empirical risk minimization and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods. We find $Y|X$-shifts are most prevalent in our testbed, in stark contrast to the heavy focus on $X$ (covariate)-shifts in the ML literature, and that the performance of robust algorithms is no better than that of vanilla methods. To understand why, we conduct an in-depth empirical analysis of DRO methods and find that underlooked implementation details -- such as the choice of underlying model class (e.g., LightGBM) and hyperparameter selection -- have a bigger impact on performance than the ambiguity set or its radius. We illustrate via case studies how a data-driven, inductive understanding of distribution shifts can provide a new approach to algorithm development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image restoration is a low-level vision task, most CNN methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and internal aesthetics. Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Yuchi Ma, Qunying Huang, Zhengwei Yang, Zhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing technology has become a promising tool in yield prediction. Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.</p>

Building on earlier studies of LLMs for tabular tasks, we probe how in-context learning (ICL), model scale, instruction tuning, and domain bias affect Tabular QA (TQA) robustness by testing LLMs, under diverse augmentations and perturbations, on diverse domains: Wikipedia-based $\textbf{WTQ}$, financial $\textbf{TAT-QA}$, and scientific $\textbf{SCITAB}$. Although instruction tuning and larger, newer LLMs deliver stronger, more robust TQA performance, data contamination and reliability issues, especially on $\textbf{WTQ}$, remain unresolved. Through an in-depth attention analysis, we reveal a strong correlation between perturbation-induced shifts in attention dispersion and the drops in performance, with sensitivity peaking in the model's middle layers. We highlight the need for improved interpretable methodologies to develop more reliable LLMs for table comprehension. Through an in-depth attention analysis, we reveal a strong correlation between perturbation-induced shifts in attention dispersion and performance drops, with sensitivity peaking in the model's middle layers. Based on these findings, we argue for the development of structure-aware self-attention mechanisms and domain-adaptive processing techniques to improve the transparency, generalization, and real-world reliability of LLMs on tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Serra Nunes, Atabak Dehban, Yiannis Demiris, Jos\'e Santos-Victor</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) observed in the last decade, the amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies remains one of the primary concerns both in simulated and real environments. Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask.
  In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned.
  To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is self-supervised agent-awareness by visuomotor prediction of the agent improves sample-efficiency and performance of the underlying RL algorithm.
  To test our approach, we first study its ability to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in simulated and real-world robotic data. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic tasks, showing that self-supervised agent-awareness can improve sample-efficiency and performance in RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victoria R. Li, Yida Chen, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: While the biases of language models in production are extensively documented, the biases of their guardrails have been neglected. This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Communication network engineering in enterprise environments is traditionally a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. Most research on network engineering automation has concentrated on configuration synthesis, often overlooking changes in the physical network topology. This paper introduces GeNet, a multimodal co-pilot for enterprise network engineers. GeNet is a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to streamline network design workflows. It uses visual and textual modalities to interpret and update network topologies and device configurations based on user intents. GeNet was evaluated on enterprise network scenarios adapted from Cisco certification exercises. Our results demonstrate GeNet's ability to interpret network topology images accurately, potentially reducing network engineers' efforts and accelerating network design processes in enterprise environments. Furthermore, we show the importance of precise topology understanding when handling intents that require modifications to the network's topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongwoo Kim, Seongyeub Chu, Hyeongmin Park, Bryan Wong, Keejun Han, Mun Yong Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

<p>Abstract: We introduce HonestCyberEval, a new benchmark for assessing AI models' capabilities and risks in automated software exploitation, focusing on their ability to detect and exploit vulnerabilities in real-world software systems. Our evaluation leverages the Nginx web server repository augmented with synthetic vulnerabilities. We assess several leading language models, including OpenAI's GPT-4.5, o3-mini, o1 and o1-mini, Anthropic's Claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620, Google DeepMind's Gemini-1.5-pro, and OpenAI's earlier GPT-4o model. Our findings reveal that these models vary significantly in their success rates and efficiency, with o1-preview achieving the highest success rate (92.85\%) and o3-mini and Claude-3.7-sonnet-20250219 providing cost-effective but less successful alternatives. This risk evaluation establishes a foundation for systematically evaluating the AI cyber risk in realistic cyber offence operations.</p>

Our first contribution is the creation of the PASTA-dataset, the first large-scale benchmark that spans a diverse set of models and both saliency-based and concept-based explanation methods. This dataset enables robust, comparative analysis of XAI techniques based on human judgment. Our second contribution is an automated, data-driven benchmark that predicts human preferences using the PASTA-dataset. This scoring called PASTA-score method offers scalable, reliable, and consistent evaluation aligned with human perception. Additionally, our benchmark allows for comparisons between explanations across different modalities, an aspect previously unaddressed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edvin Listo Zec, Adam Breitholtz, Fredrik D. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple actors to collaboratively train models without sharing private data. Existing algorithms are successful and well-justified in this task when the intended target domain, where the trained model will be used, shares data distribution with the aggregate of clients, but this is often violated in practice. A common reason is label shift -- that the label distributions differ between clients and the target domain. We demonstrate empirically that this can significantly degrade performance. To address this problem, we propose FedPALS, a principled and practical model aggregation scheme that adapts to label shifts to improve performance in the target domain by leveraging knowledge of label distributions at the central server. Our approach ensures unbiased updates under federated stochastic gradient descent which yields robust generalization across clients with diverse, label-shifted data. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that FedPALS consistently outperforms baselines by aligning model aggregation with the target domain. Our findings reveal that conventional federated learning methods suffer severely in cases of extreme label sparsity on clients, highlighting the critical need for target-aware aggregation as offered by FedPALS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Bai, Mohammad Sadegh Talebi, Chengcheng Zhao, Peng Cheng, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential decision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns arising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in advanced Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where learning from operational and user data can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential privacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires a fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the local model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for many control applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the emerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides strong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present Shuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic policy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our method introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting'' mechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance. Our analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound, demonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off that significantly outperforms the local model. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle model for secure data-driven control in advanced CPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhua Liu, Yong Keat Tan, Bin Fu, Kwan Hui Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: In conversational AI systems, a critical challenge in training effective multi-turn intent classification models lies in the generation of large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual dialogue datasets. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven, context-aware dialogues through self-play. Our method first extracts domain-specific intent transition patterns from real-world e-commerce chat logs, which guide the modeling of turn-level dynamics and intent sequences. LLMs are then employed to parameterize the emission probabilities of HMMs, enabling the generation of natural, coherent utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. We further propose MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, which improves performance while reducing dependence on large-scale annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in both dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, particularly in multilingual settings. To facilitate future research, we release MINT-E, a comprehensive, multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn dialogue corpus derived from the e-commerce domain.

<p>Abstract: We present an online planning framework and a new benchmark dataset for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. To enable rigorous evaluation of rearrangement challenges, we introduce MultiRoomR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring diverse multi-room environments with varying degrees of partial observability (10-30\% initial visibility), blocked paths, obstructed goals, and multiple objects (10-20) distributed across 2-4 rooms. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively handles these complex scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with imperfect perception, achieving promising results across both existing benchmarks and our new MultiRoomR dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Brauner, Felix Glawe, Gian Luca Liehner, Luisa Vervier, Martina Ziefle</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping many societal domains, raising critical questions about its risks, benefits, and the potential misalignment between public and academic perspectives. This study examines how the general public (N=1110) -- individuals who interact with or are impacted by AI technologies -- and academic AI experts (N=119) -- those elites shaping AI development -- perceive AI's capabilities and impact across 71 scenarios. These scenarios span domains such as sustainability, healthcare, job performance, societal inequality, art, and warfare. Participants evaluated these scenarios across four dimensions using the psychometric model: likelihood, perceived risk and benefit, and overall value (or sentiment). The results suggest significant differences: experts consistently anticipate higher probabilities, perceive lower risks, report greater benefits, and express more positive sentiment toward AI compared to the non-experts. Moreover, both groups apply different weighting schemes: experts discount risk more heavily relative to benefit than non-experts. Visual mappings of these evaluations uncover areas convergent evaluations (e.g., AI performing medical diagnoses or criminal use) as well as tension points (e.g., decision of legal cases, political decision making), highlighting areas where communication and policy interventions may be needed. These findings underscore a critical translational challenge: if AI research and deployment are to align with societal priorities, the perception gap between developers and the public must be better understood and addressed. Our results provide an empirical foundation for value-sensitive AI governance and trust-building strategies across stakeholder groups.</p>

<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, understanding public perceptions -- including biases, risks, and benefits -- is essential for guiding research priorities and AI alignment, shaping public discourse, and informing policy. This exploratory study investigates cultural differences in mental models of AI using 71 imaginaries of AI's potential futures. Drawing on cross-cultural convenience samples from Germany (N=52) and China (N=60), we identify significant differences in expectations, evaluations, and risk-benefit tradeoffs. Participants from Germany generally provided more cautious assessments, whereas participants from China expressed greater optimism regarding AI's societal benefits. Chinese participants exhibited relatively balanced risk-benefit tradeoffs ($\beta=-0.463$ for risk and $\beta=+0.484$ for benefit, $r^2=.630$). In contrast, German participants placed greater emphasis on AI's benefits and comparatively less on risks ($\beta=-0.337$ for risk and $\beta=+0.715$ for benefit, $r^2=.839$). Visual cognitive maps illustrate these contrasts, offering new perspectives on how cultural contexts shape AI acceptance. Our findings highlight key factors influencing public perception and provide insights for aligning AI with societal values and promoting equitable and culturally sensitive integration of AI technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable advancements by leveraging tools to interact with environments, a critical step toward generalized AI. However, the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach, which relies on large-scale datasets, often overlooks task-specific characteristics in tool use, leading to performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we analyze three existing LLMs and uncover key insights: training data can inadvertently impede tool-use behavior, token importance is distributed unevenly, and errors in tool calls fall into a small set of categories. Building on these findings, we propose~\emph{TL-Training}, a task-feature-based framework that mitigates the effects of suboptimal training data, dynamically adjusts token weights to prioritize key tokens during SFT, and incorporates a robust reward mechanism tailored to error categories, optimized through proximal policy optimization. We validate TL-Training by training CodeLLaMA-2-7B and evaluating it on four open-source test sets. Our results demonstrate that the LLM trained by our method matches or surpasses both open- and closed-source LLMs in tool-use performance using only 1,217 training data points. Additionally, our method enhances robustness in noisy environments and improves general task performance, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for tool-use training in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/TL-Training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayhan Alp Aydeniz, Enrico Marchesini, Robert Loftin, Christopher Amato, Kagan Tumer</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world multiagent learning problems involve safety concerns. In these setups, typical safe reinforcement learning algorithms constrain agents' behavior, limiting exploration -- a crucial component for discovering effective cooperative multiagent behaviors. Moreover, the multiagent literature typically models individual constraints for each agent and has yet to investigate the benefits of using joint team constraints. In this work, we analyze these team constraints from a theoretical and practical perspective and propose entropic exploration for constrained multiagent reinforcement learning (E2C) to address the exploration issue. E2C leverages observation entropy maximization to incentivize exploration and facilitate learning safe and effective cooperative behaviors. Experiments across increasingly complex domains show that E2C agents match or surpass common unconstrained and constrained baselines in task performance while reducing unsafe behaviors by up to $50\%$.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has brought a significant change to our society. GenAI can be applied across numerous fields, with particular relevance in cybersecurity. Among the various areas of application, its use in penetration testing (pentesting) or ethical hacking processes is of special interest. In this paper, we have analyzed the potential of leading generic-purpose GenAI tools-Claude Opus, GPT-4 from ChatGPT, and Copilot-in augmenting the penetration testing process as defined by the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES). Our analysis involved evaluating each tool across all PTES phases within a controlled virtualized environment. The findings reveal that, while these tools cannot fully automate the pentesting process, they provide substantial support by enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in specific tasks. Notably, all tools demonstrated utility; however, Claude Opus consistently outperformed the others in our experimental scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Kiu Chung, Shreyas Kousik</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical control applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. While many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, few address how to correct an unsafe network. The handful of works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To begin addressing these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact image of a non-convex input set for a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region. This is accomplished by reachability analysis with scaled hybrid zonotopes, a modification of the existing hybrid zonotope set representation that enables parameterized scaling of non-convex polytopic sets with a differentiable collision check via mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method was shown to be effective and fast for networks with up to 240 neurons, with the computational complexity dominated by inverse operations on matrices that scale linearly in size with the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by training a forward-invariant neural network controller for an affine dynamical system with a non-convex input set, as well as generating safe reach-avoid plans for a black-box dynamical system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Cutler, Arun Kandoor, Nishanth Dikkala, Nikunj Saunshi, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding in a Transformer based language model is inherently sequential as a token's embedding needs to pass through all the layers in the network before the generation of the next token can begin. In this work, we propose a new architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggers execution along the sequence axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the "rich" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding a potential speedup in decoding while being quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural extensions of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications. We also explore the scalability of the staggering idea over more than 2 sections of the Transformer. Finally, we show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using weight-sharing. This variant can lead to substantial gains in quality for short generations while being neutral in its latency impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny T. Liang, Aayush Kumar, Yasharth Bajpai, Sumit Gulwani, Vu Le, Chris Parnin, Arjun Radhakrishna, Ashish Tiwari, Emerson Murphy-Hill, Guastavo Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: Spreadsheet programming is challenging. Programmers use spreadsheet programming knowledge (e.g., formulas) and problem-solving skills to combine actions into complex tasks. Advancements in large language models have introduced language agents that observe, plan, and perform tasks, showing promise for spreadsheet creation. We present TableTalk, a spreadsheet programming agent embodying three design principles -- scaffolding, flexibility, and incrementality -- derived from studies with seven spreadsheet programmers and 85 Excel templates. TableTalk guides programmers through structured plans based on professional workflows, generating three potential next steps to adapt plans to programmer needs. It uses pre-defined tools to generate spreadsheet components and incrementally build spreadsheets. In a study with 20 programmers, TableTalk produced higher-quality spreadsheets 2.3 times more likely to be preferred than the baseline. It reduced cognitive load and thinking time by 12.6%. From this, we derive design guidelines for agentic spreadsheet programming tools and discuss implications on spreadsheet programming, end-user programming, AI-assisted programming, and human-agent collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxiang Zhao, Saier Hu, Xiaoqi Jian, Jinzhu Wu, Yuhan Wu, Change Jia, Lin Sun, Xiangzheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a ``Generalization Stress Test" to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) generalization ability under slight and controlled perturbations, including option length, problem types, and irrelevant noun replacements. We achieve novel and significant findings that, despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit severe accuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors) when faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example, Qwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when option lengths are changed without altering the question. Even GPT4o experiences a 25-point accuracy loss when problem types are changed, with a 6-point drop across all three modification categories. These analyses suggest that LLMs rely heavily on superficial cues rather than forming robust, abstract representations that generalize across formats, lexical variations, and irrelevant content shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyoung Lee, Xiaochen Zhu, Georgi Karadzhov, Tom Stafford, Andreas Vlachos, Dongwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has presented significant challenges in distinguishing authentic human-authored content from deepfake content. Collaborative human efforts, augmented by AI tools, present a promising solution. In this study, we explore the potential of DeepFakeDeLiBot, a deliberation-enhancing chatbot, to support groups in detecting deepfake text. Our findings reveal that group-based problem-solving significantly improves the accuracy of identifying machine-generated paragraphs compared to individual efforts. While engagement with DeepFakeDeLiBot does not yield substantial performance gains overall, it enhances group dynamics by fostering greater participant engagement, consensus building, and the frequency and diversity of reasoning-based utterances. Additionally, participants with higher perceived effectiveness of group collaboration exhibited performance benefits from DeepFakeDeLiBot. These findings underscore the potential of deliberative chatbots in fostering interactive and productive group dynamics while ensuring accuracy in collaborative deepfake text detection. \textit{Dataset and source code used in this study will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwonyoung Kim, Jungin Park, Jin Kim, Hyeongjun Kwon, Kwanghoon Sohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jes\'us Garc\'ia Fern\'andez, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological neural systems efficiently learn from delayed rewards despite relying on noisy synaptic transmission and lacking centralized optimization mechanisms. In contrast, artificial neural networks trained with reinforcement learning typically rely on backpropagation (BP), which limits their use in resource-constrained systems or with non-differentiable components. While noise-based alternatives, like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), provide a biologically grounded framework for credit assignment, they struggle with temporal delays and hierarchical processing -key challenges in real-world learning. In this work, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule to address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from biological neural circuits, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Its formulation relies on local information, aligning with biological constraints and enabling neuromorphic implementation. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks (immediate and delayed rewards) shows our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and achieves performance comparable to BP, although with slower convergence due to its noise-driven updates. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency and biological plausibility are a priority. These findings also offer mechanistic insights into how dopamine-like signals and synaptic stochasticity may jointly enable learning in biological networks, bridging computational models with neurobiological principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Li, Yi Cao, Hongyang He, Qisen Cheng, Xiang Fu, Xi Xiao, Tianyang Wang, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) equips Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) with the ability to adapt to new tasks via multiple user-provided demonstrations, without requiring any model parameter updates. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M$^2$IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M$^2$IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M$^2$IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M$^2$IVs for flexible retrieval and injection. With VLibrary, users can steer pre-trained LVLMs in a customized manner that meets diverse requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M$^2$IV consistently outperforms vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering baselines, achieving an average accuracy gain of 3.74\% with substantial improvements in overall efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kerol Djoumessi, Samuel Ofosu Mensah, Philipp Berens</p>
<p>Abstract: In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

<p>Abstract: Echocardiography records ultrasound videos of the heart, enabling clinicians to assess cardiac function. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred interest in automating echocardiographic interpretation. However, most existing medical VLMs rely on single-frame (image) inputs, which can reduce diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable only through cardiac motion. In addition, echocardiographic videos are captured from multiple views, each varying in suitability for detecting specific conditions. Leveraging multiple views may therefore improve diagnostic performance. We developed a video-language model that processes full video sequences from five standard views, trained on 60,747 echocardiographic video-report pairs. We evaluated the gains in retrieval performance from video input and multi-view support, including the contributions of various pretrained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yakai Li, Jiekang Hu, Weiduan Sang, Luping Ma, Dongsheng Nie, Weijuan Zhang, Aimin Yu, Yi Su, Qingjia Huang, Qihang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models face security threats from jailbreak attacks. Existing research has predominantly focused on prompt-level attacks while largely ignoring the underexplored attack surface of user-controlled response prefilling. This functionality allows an attacker to dictate the beginning of a model's output, thereby shifting the attack paradigm from persuasion to direct state manipulation.In this paper, we present a systematic black-box security analysis of prefill-level jailbreak attacks. We categorize these new attacks and evaluate their effectiveness across fourteen language models. Our experiments show that prefill-level attacks achieve high success rates, with adaptive methods exceeding 99% on several models. Token-level probability analysis reveals that these attacks work through initial-state manipulation by changing the first-token probability from refusal to compliance.Furthermore, we show that prefill-level jailbreak can act as effective enhancers, increasing the success of existing prompt-level attacks by 10 to 15 percentage points. Our evaluation of several defense strategies indicates that conventional content filters offer limited protection. We find that a detection method focusing on the manipulative relationship between the prompt and the prefill is more effective. Our findings reveal a gap in current LLM safety alignment and highlight the need to address the prefill attack surface in future safety training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hudson de Martim</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Hou, Jiahao Han, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed through open-source and commercial frameworks, enabling individuals and organizations to self-host advanced LLM capabilities. As LLM deployments become prevalent, particularly in industry, ensuring their secure and reliable operation has become a critical issue. However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public internet, posing serious security and system engineering risks. This study conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of public-facing LLM deployments, focusing on the prevalence of services, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Through internet-wide measurements, we identified 320,102 public-facing LLM services across 15 frameworks and extracted 158 unique API endpoints, categorized into 12 functional groups based on functionality and security risk. Our analysis found that over 40% of endpoints used plain HTTP, and over 210,000 endpoints lacked valid TLS metadata. API exposure was highly inconsistent: some frameworks, such as Ollama, responded to over 35% of unauthenticated API requests, with about 15% leaking model or system information, while other frameworks implemented stricter controls. We observed widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. These security risks, such as model leakage, system compromise, and unauthorized access, are pervasive and highlight the need for a secure-by-default framework and stronger deployment practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchen Wu, Stephan Alaniz, Shyamgopal Karthik, Peter Dayan, Eric Schulz, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanfang Cui, Longfei Song, Li Li, Dongxing Xu, Yanhua Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT, WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration, dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific fusion and robust SED system design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Huang, Junyan Zhang, Zihao Wang, Biquan Bie, Yunzhong Qiu, Yi R. Fung, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image classification is critical for clinical decision-making, yet demands for accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability remain challenging. This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihe Tang, Wenlong Huang, Yingke Wang, Chengshu Li, Roy Yuan, Ruohan Zhang, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

<p>Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this work, we present XAStruct, a learning-based system capable of both predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70 elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety of chemistries and bonding environments. The framework includes the first machine learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra, as well as a generalizable regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that requires no element-specific tuning. By combining deep neural networks for complex structure property mappings with efficient baseline models for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weike Zhao, Chaoyi Wu, Yanjie Fan, Xiaoman Zhang, Pengcheng Qiu, Yuze Sun, Xiao Zhou, Yanfeng Wang, Xin Sun, Ya Zhang, Yongguo Yu, Kun Sun, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samed Do\u{g}an, Maximilian Hoh, Nico Leuze, Nicolas Rodriguez Pe\~na, Alfred Sch\"ottl</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-world data acquisition requires extensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and scenario coverage. Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently, we present solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Ting Cai, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Ahmed, Ali Shariq Imran, Zenun Kastrati, Sher Muhammad Daudpota</p>
<p>Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-rays. Thirdly, we improve the performance further by utilizing weights trained on a separate fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Dong, Haoran Zhao, Jiang Gao, Haozhou Li, Xiaoguang Ma, Yaoming Zhou, Fuhai Chen, Juan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Liu, Enpei Niu, Yin Hua, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Sharshar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Davor Svetinovic, Amr M. Youssef, Deepa Kundur, Ehab F. El-Saadany</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Rojas-Galeano</p>
<p>Abstract: The arrival of AI coding assistants in educational settings presents a paradigm shift, introducing a "new kid in the classroom" for both students and instructors. This exploratory study addresses how these tools are shaping the experiences of novice programmers in an introductory programming course. Through a two-part exam, we investigated student perceptions by first providing access to AI support for a programming task and then requiring an extension of the solution without it. We collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to understand their perceptions on the challenges they faced. Our findings reveal that students perceived AI tools as helpful for grasping code concepts and boosting their confidence during the initial development phase. However, a noticeable difficulty emerged when students were asked to work unaided, pointing to potential overreliance and gaps in foundational knowledge transfer. These insights highlight a critical need for new pedagogical approaches that integrate AI effectively while effectively enhancing core programming skills, rather than impersonating them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyebin Cho, Jaehyup Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410">Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saghar Ganji, Ahmad Reza Labibzadeh, Alireza Hassani, Mohammad Naisipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewan Moon, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Xu, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a 16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention - clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods; 2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic, making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs, which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phurinut Srisawad, Juergen Branke, Long Tran-Thanh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games, where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Zhou, Daniele Solombrino, Donato Crisostomi, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Giuseppe Alessio D'Inverno, Fabrizio Silvestri, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Fastowski, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics, often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16313">Retrieval Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongyeop Hyun, Bumsoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hichem Cheriet, Khellat Kihel Badra, Chouraqui Samira</p>
<p>Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes, different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to finding solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muchammad Daniyal Kautsar, Afra Majida Hariono,  Widyawan, Syukron Abu Ishaq Alfarozi, Kuntpong Woraratpanya</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to 51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance, consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and practical deployment in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jussi S. Jauhiainen, Aurora Toppari</p>
<p>Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning, and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings, and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the limitations and risks they entail.
  The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment, and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.
  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal responsibilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Voice authentication has undergone significant changes from traditional systems that relied on handcrafted acoustic features to deep learning models that can extract robust speaker embeddings. This advancement has expanded its applications across finance, smart devices, law enforcement, and beyond. However, as adoption has grown, so have the threats. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the modern threat landscape targeting Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) and Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures (CMs), including data poisoning, adversarial, deepfake, and adversarial spoofing attacks. We chronologically trace the development of voice authentication and examine how vulnerabilities have evolved in tandem with technological advancements. For each category of attack, we summarize methodologies, highlight commonly used datasets, compare performance and limitations, and organize existing literature using widely accepted taxonomies. By highlighting emerging risks and open challenges, this survey aims to support the development of more secure and resilient voice authentication systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving. However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited. In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Sunzhu Li, Shunyu Liu, Wenkai Fang, Jiale Zhao, Jingwen Yang, Jianwei Lv, Kongcheng Zhang, Yihe Zhou, Hengtong Lu, Wei Chen, Yan Xie, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. This work is still in progress, and we will release the code, the models, and the datasets soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA) on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343">Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhik Roychoudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p>

<p>Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation, leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging, large-scale pointclouds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Ganzfried</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Wang, Feng Jiang, Zhanquan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results, we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method (Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior. The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and long-term predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics.
