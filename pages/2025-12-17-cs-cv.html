<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Bai, Yongkun Du, Yuchen Su, Yazhen Xie, Zhineng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) has made significant progress in recognizing simple expressions, but the robust recognition of complex mathematical expressions with many tokens and multiple lines remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M. Experimental results show that CMERNet, with only 125 million parameters, significantly outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yajie Yang, Yuqing Zhao, Xiaochao Xi, Yinan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) assisting image production triggers controversy in journalism while attracting attention from media agencies. Key issues involve misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability. Most AIGC tools are opaque "black boxes," hindering the dual demands of content accuracy and semantic alignment and creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas. This paper explores pathways for controllable image production in journalism's special coverage and conducts two experiments with projects from China's media agency: (1) Experiment 1 tests cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes, revealing disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. (2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials. Traceable deployment preserves semantic representation. Consequently, we propose a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC assisted image production in special coverage and recommend evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Dai, Lunxiao Li, Kun Zhao, Eardi Lila, Paul K. Crane, Heng Huang, Dongkuan Xu, Haoteng Tang, Liang Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities on vision-language tasks. In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Qin, Jiancheng Huang, Limeng Qiao, Lin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) play a pivotal role in advancing the quest for general artificial intelligence. However, achieving unified target for multimodal understanding and generation remains challenging due to optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs. To effectively enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities, we introduce STAR: a STacked AutoRegressive scheme for task-progressive unified multimodal learning. This approach decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages: understanding, generation, and editing. By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mika Sipil\"a, Sabrina Maggio, Sandra De Iaco, Klaus Nordhausen, Monica Palma, Sara Taskinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are often available only at coarse spatial resolution, limiting their applicability in local-scale environmental analysis and decision-making. Spatial downscaling methods aim to transform the coarse satellite data into high-resolution fields. In this work, two widely used deep learning architectures, the super-resolution deep residual network (SRDRN) and the encoder-decoder-based UNet, are considered for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone. Both methods are extended with a lightweight temporal module, which encodes observation time using either sinusoidal or radial basis function (RBF) encoding, and fuses the temporal features with the spatial representations in the networks. The proposed time-aware extensions are evaluated against their baseline counterparts in a case study on ozone downscaling over Italy. The results suggest that, while only slightly increasing computational complexity, the temporal modules significantly improve downscaling performance and convergence speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Rong, Jan Held, Victor Chu, Daniel Rebain, Marc Van Droogenbroeck, Kiriakos N. Kutulakos, Andrea Tagliasacchi, David B. Lindell</p>
<p>Abstract: Though Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, it requires millions of primitives to model highly textured scenes, even when the geometry of the scene is simple. We propose a representation that goes beyond point-based rendering and decouples geometry and appearance in order to achieve a compact representation. We use surfels for geometry and a combination of a global neural field and per-primitive colours for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives for each pixel, ensuring that the added compute is low. Our representation matches the perceptual quality of 3D Gaussian splatting while using $9.7\times$ fewer primitives and $5.5\times$ less memory on outdoor scenes and using $31\times$ fewer primitives and $3.7\times$ less memory on indoor scenes. Our representation also renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives while improving upon their visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannan He, Garvita Tiwari, Xiaohan Zhang, Pankaj Bora, Tolga Birdal, Jan Eric Lenssen, Gerard Pons-Moll</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MoLingo, a text-to-motion (T2M) model that generates realistic, lifelike human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space. Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ujjwal Mishra, Vinita Shukla, Praful Hambarde, Amit Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Vision Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) to medical imaging domains requires significant computational overhead when using conventional fine-tuning approaches. Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods apply uniform adapter dimensions across all transformer layers, leading to suboptimal parameter allocation and reduced adaptation efficiency. We introduce Telescopic Adapters, a novel PEFT framework that employs depth-aware scaling to progressively increase adapter capacity from shallow to deep transformer layers. Our method integrates lightweight bottleneck modules within CLIPSeg's vision and text encoders, with adapter dimensions dynamically scaled based on layer depth and semantic relevance. Using only 613k trainable parameters--244x fewer than end-to-end fine-tuning, Telescopic Adapters achieve superior performance across five diverse medical datasets spanning polyp segmentation, skin lesion detection, and breast ultrasound imaging. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that deeper layers require substantially more adaptation capacity than shallow layers, validating our telescopic scaling hypothesis. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for efficient medical VLSM fine-tuning, enabling deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13869">Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment for UAV-based Human Detection using Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Li, Meng Wu, Sungmin Eum, Heesung Kwon, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training object detectors demands extensive, task-specific annotations, yet this requirement becomes impractical in UAV-based human detection due to constantly shifting target distributions and the scarcity of labeled images. As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the global and local stages and highlight the importance of hierarchical alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jitesh Jain, Jialuo Li, Zixian Ma, Jieyu Zhang, Chris Dongjoo Kim, Sangho Lee, Rohun Tripathi, Tanmay Gupta, Christopher Clark, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Zhang, Qi Chen, Wenyou Huang, Rui Liu, Zhengjian Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detection Transformer (DETR) offers an end-to-end solution for object detection by eliminating hand-crafted components like non-maximum suppression. However, DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations. We present Route-DETR, which addresses these issues through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers. Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anning Tian, Byunghyun Ko, Kaichen Qu, Mengyuan Liu, Jeongkyu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time deployment of prostate MRI segmentation on clinical workstations is often bottlenecked by computational load and memory footprint. Deep learning-based prostate gland segmentation approaches remain challenging due to anatomical variability. To bridge this efficiency gap while still maintaining reliable segmentation accuracy, we propose KLO-Net, a dynamic K-Nearest Neighbor attention U-Net with Cross Stage Partial, i.e., CSP, encoder for efficient prostate gland segmentation from MRI scan. Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice. In addition, CSP blocks address the computational load to reduce memory consumption. To evaluate the model's performance, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx, to validate the proposed architecture. The detailed comparative analysis demonstrates the model's advantage in computational efficiency and segmentation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alban Gauthier, Valentin Deschaintre, Alexandre Lanvin, Fredo Durand, Adrien Bousseau, George Drettakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital content creation is experiencing a profound change with the advent of deep generative models. For texturing, conditional image generators now allow the synthesis of realistic RGB images of a 3D scene that align with the geometry of that scene. For appearance modeling, SVBRDF prediction networks recover material parameters from RGB images. Combining these technologies allows us to quickly generate SVBRDF maps for multiple views of a 3D scene, which can be merged to form a SVBRDF texture atlas of that scene. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities for SVBRDF prediction in the context of such a fast appearance modeling pipeline. On the one hand, single-view SVBRDF predictions might suffer from multiview incoherence and yield inconsistent texture atlases. On the other hand, generated RGB images, and the different modalities on which they are conditioned, can provide additional information for SVBRDF estimation compared to photographs. We compare neural architectures and conditions to identify designs that achieve high accuracy and coherence. We find that, surprisingly, a standard UNet is competitive with more complex designs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawid Malarz, Artur Kasymov, Filip Manjak, Maciej Zi\k{e}ba, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image diffusion models raises significant concerns regarding the unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content. While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques. Project Page: https://gmum.github.io/UNBRANDING/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaohua Zhang, Mohammad Ali Armin, Xuesong Li, Sisi Liang, Lars Petersson, Changming Sun, David Ahmedt-Aristizabal, Zeeshan Hayder</p>
<p>Abstract: Marine obstacle detection demands robust segmentation under challenging conditions, such as sun glitter, fog, and rapidly changing wave patterns. These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity. Across marine obstacle benchmarks, augmenting training data with these controlled synthetic samples consistently improves segmentation performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Abuzeid, Shimaa El-Bana, Ahmad Al-Kabbany</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models in medical imaging is severely hindered by domain shift. This challenge, where a high-performing model fails catastrophically on external datasets, is a critical barrier to trustworthy AI. Addressing this requires moving beyond simple performance metrics toward deeper understanding, making Explainable AI (XAI) an essential diagnostic tool in medical image analysis. We present a rigorous, two-phase approach to diagnose the generalization failure of state-of-the-art State-Space Models (SSMs), specifically UMamaba, applied to cerebrovascular segmentation. We first established a quantifiable domain gap between our Source (RSNA CTA Aneurysm) and Target (TopCoW Circle of Willis CT) datasets, noting significant differences in Z-resolution and background noise. The model's Dice score subsequently plummeted from 0.8604 (Source) to 0.2902 (Target). In the second phase, which is our core contribution, we utilized Seg-XRes-CAM to diagnose the cause of this failure. We quantified the model's focus by measuring the overlap between its attention maps and the Ground Truth segmentations, and between its attention maps and its own Prediction Mask. Our analysis proves the model failed to generalize because its attention mechanism abandoned true anatomical features in the Target domain. Quantitative metrics confirm the model's focus shifted away from the Ground Truth vessels (IoU~0.101 at 0.3 threshold) while still aligning with its own wrong predictions (IoU~0.282 at 0.3 threshold). This demonstrates the model learned spurious correlations, confirming XAI is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying dataset bias in emerging architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dereje Shenkut, Vijayakumar Bhagavatula</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) is a promising paradigm for improving autonomous driving safety, particularly for vulnerable road users like pedestrians, via robust 3D perception. However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups. FocalComm also shows a strong performance gain in pedestrian detection in V2X-Real.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao He, Youngjoong Kwon, Tiange Xiang, Wenxiao Cai, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a framework that adapts 2D diffusion models for 3D shape completion from incomplete point clouds. While text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success with abundant 2D data, 3D diffusion models lag due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and a persistent modality gap between 3D inputs and 2D latent spaces. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Shape Atlas, a compact 2D representation of 3D geometry that (1) enables full utilization of the generative power of pretrained 2D diffusion models, and (2) aligns the modalities between the conditional input and output spaces, allowing more effective conditioning. This unified 2D formulation facilitates learning from limited 3D data and produces high-quality, detail-preserving shape completions. We validate the effectiveness of our results on the PCN and ShapeNet-55 datasets. Additionally, we show the downstream application of creating artist-created meshes from our completed point clouds, further demonstrating the practicality of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shufan Li, Jiuxiang Gu, Kangning Liu, Zhe Lin, Zijun Wei, Aditya Grover, Jason Kuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyao Li, Kengo Ishida, Satoshi Yamazaki, Xiaotong Ji, Jianquan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibing Fu, Yunpeng Zhao, Zhitao Zeng, Cheng Chen, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning integrating medical images and tabular data has significantly advanced clinical decision-making in recent years. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for effective and scalable cross-tabular multi-modal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaheng Li, Qiyu Dai, Lihan Li, Praneeth Chakravarthula, He Sun, Baoquan Chen, Wenzheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Alzugaray, Marwan Taher, Andrew J. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel neural RGB-D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system that learns an implicit map of the scene in real time. For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.
  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Wei, Cheng Zhang, Jianmin Zheng, Hamid Rezatofighi, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances have equipped 3D Gaussian Splatting with texture parameterizations to capture spatially varying attributes, improving the performance of both appearance modeling and downstream tasks. However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boran Wang, Xinming Wang, Yi Chen, Xiang Li, Jian Xu, Jing Yuan, Chenglin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With their high information density and intuitive readability, charts have become the de facto medium for data analysis and communication across disciplines. Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenguo Zhang, Haohan Zhen, Yishen Wang, Le Xu, Tianchen Deng, Xuefeng Chen, Qu Chen, Bo Zhang, Wuxiong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and "zoom in" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.</p>

Utilizing an image-text encoder and a character-level tokenizer, SELECT addresses the issues of variable-length sequence labels, label sequence misalignment, and character-level errors, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and practical utility. In addition, we introduce Similarity-based Sequence Label Corruption (SSLC), a process that intentionally introduces errors into the training labels to mimic real-world error scenarios during training. SSLC not only can cause a change in the sequence length but also takes into account the visual similarity between characters during corruption. Our method is the first to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets successfully accounting for variable-length labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SELECT in detecting label errors and improving STR accuracy on real-world text datasets, showcasing its practical utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current multimodal large lanauge models possess strong perceptual and reasoning capabilities, however high computational and memory requirements make them difficult to deploy directly on on-device environments. While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Daylight-linked controls (DLCs) have significant potential for energy savings in buildings, especially when abundant daylight is available and indoor workplane illuminance can be accurately predicted in real time. Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Junyang Chen, Jinshan Pan, Jiangxin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion-based one-step methods have shown remarkable progress in the field of image super-resolution, yet they remain constrained by three critical limitations: (1) inferior fidelity performance caused by the information loss from compression encoding of low-quality (LQ) inputs; (2) insufficient region-discriminative activation of generative priors; (3) misalignment between text prompts and their corresponding semantic regions. To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity compared with state-of-the-art methods with efficient one-step inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Cheng, Yuhua Jiang, Zineng Zhou, Dawei Liu, Wang Tao, Linfeng Zhang, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Block-wise discrete diffusion offers an attractive balance between parallel generation and causal dependency modeling, making it a promising backbone for vision-language modeling. However, its practical adoption has been limited by high training cost, slow convergence, and instability, which have so far kept it behind strong autoregressive (AR) baselines. We present \textbf{SDAR-VL}, the first systematic application of block-wise discrete diffusion to large-scale vision-language understanding (VLU), together with an \emph{integrated framework for efficient and stable training}. This framework unifies three components: (1) \textbf{Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling} to diversify supervision within each batch; (2) \textbf{Effective Mask Ratio Scaling} for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking; and (3) a \textbf{Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum} that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity. Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show that SDAR-VL consistently improves \emph{training efficiency}, \emph{convergence stability}, and \emph{task performance} over conventional block diffusion. On this evaluation suite, SDAR-VL sets a new state of the art among diffusion-based vision-language models and, under matched settings, matches or surpasses strong AR baselines such as LLaVA-OneVision as well as the global diffusion baseline LLaDA-V, establishing block-wise diffusion as a practical backbone for VLU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang, Risa Shinoda, Hiroaki Santo, Fumio Okura</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Holm, Ghazal Ghazaei, Nassir Navab</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Detailed surgical recognition is critical for advancing AI-assisted surgery, yet progress is hampered by high annotation costs, data scarcity, and a lack of interpretable models. While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.
  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.
  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.
  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhi Nguyen, Constantino \'Alvarez Casado, Le Nguyen, Manuel Lage Ca\~nellas, Miguel Bordallo L\'opez</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sisi Dai, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14096">OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruitong Sun, Tianze Yang, Wei Niu, Jin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruishu Zhu, Zhihao Huang, Jiacheng Sun, Ping Luo, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Mezzi, Gertjan Burghouts, Maarten Kruithof</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Mishra, Gyanaranjan Nayak, Tarun Kumar, Arpit Shah, Suparna Bhattacharya, Martin Foltin</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui-Yang Ju, KokSheik Wong, Yanlin Jin, Jen-Shiun Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Tian, Ruting Lin, Hongxian Zheng, Yaodong Yang, Geng Wu, Zihao Zhang, Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing intelligent sports analysis systems mainly focus on "scoring and visualization," often lacking automatic performance diagnosis and interpretable training guidance. Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the KISMAM and SportsRAG, confirming that SportsGPT surpasses general LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and professionalism.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Consistent Instance Field, a continuous and probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scene understanding. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Mishra, Tarun Kumar, Gyanaranjan Nayak, Arpit Shah, Suparna Bhattacharya, Martin Foltin</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuxin Zhao, Bo Lang, Nan Xiao, Yilang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Hoche, Andrei Bursuc, David Brellmann, Gilles Louppe, Pavel Izmailov, Angela Yao, Gianni Franchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Sario, Daniel Rebain, Dor Verbin, Marco Grangetto, Andrea Tagliasacchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassandra Krause, Mattias P. Heinrich, Ron Keuth</p>
<p>Abstract: Between $15\,\%$ and $45\,\%$ of children experience a fracture during their growth years, making accurate diagnosis essential. Fracture morphology, alongside location and fragment angle, is a key diagnostic feature. In this work, we propose a method to extract fracture morphology by assigning automatically global AO codes to corresponding fracture bounding boxes. This approach enables the use of public datasets and reformulates the global multilabel task into a local multiclass one, improving the average F1 score by $7.89\,\%$. However, performance declines when using imperfect fracture detectors, highlighting challenges for real-world deployment. Our code is available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxiao Li, Wenzong Ma, Taoyu Wu, Jinjing Zhu, Zhenchao Q, Shuai Zhang, Jing Ou, Yinrui Ren, Weiqing Qi, Guobin Shen, Hui Xiong, Wufan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Bai, Liudi Yang, George Eskandar, Fengyi Shen, Mohammad Altillawi, Ziyuan Liu, Gitta Kutyniok</p>
<p>Abstract: Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xichen Ding, Jianzhe Gao, Cong Pan, Wenguan Wang, Jie Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents to localize targets in large-scale urban environments based on linguistic instructions. While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rawan Alyahya, Asrar Alruwayqi, Atheer Alqarni, Asma Alkhaldi, Metab Alkubeyyer, Xin Gao, Mona Alshahrani</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of MGMT promoter methylation significantly affects how well chemotherapy works for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools. Our study highlights the potential of non-invasive methods for identifying MGMT promoter methylation and contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juze Zhang, Changan Chen, Xin Chen, Heng Yu, Tiange Xiang, Ali Sartaz Khan, Shrinidhi K. Lakshmikanth, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond "speech-conditioned motion generation" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimmie Kwok, Holger Caesar, Andras Palffy</p>
<p>Abstract: Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing demand for immersive 3D content calls for automated monocular-to-stereo video conversion. We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob. Experiments on three different datasets of real-world stereo videos show that our method outperforms both traditional warping-based and recent warping-free baselines and sets a new standard for reliable, controllable stereo video conversion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wan, Kaiyu Wu, Qingyang Ma, Nan Kang, Yunjie Chen, Liang Lin, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreedhar Govil, Didier Stricker, Jason Rambach</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqian Shen, Min-Hung Chen, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Ryo Hachiuma</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for representation learning without manual annotations. However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akila Premarathna, Kanishka Hewageegana, Garcia Andarcia Mariangel</p>
<p>Abstract: In regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), there is a high demand for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), crucial for sustainable water management. Precise identification of WWTPs from satellite images enables environmental monitoring. Traditional methods like YOLOv8 segmentation require extensive manual labeling. But studies indicate that vision-language models (VLMs) are an efficient alternative to achieving equivalent or superior results through inherent reasoning and annotation. This study presents a structured methodology for VLM comparison, divided into zero-shot and few-shot streams specifically to identify WWTPs. The YOLOv8 was trained on a governmental dataset of 83,566 high-resolution satellite images from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE: ~85% WWTPs (positives), 15% non-WWTPs (negatives). Evaluated VLMs include LLaMA 3.2 Vision, Qwen 2.5 VL, DeepSeek-VL2, Gemma 3, Gemini, and Pixtral 12B (Mistral), used to identify WWTP components such as circular/rectangular tanks, aeration basins and distinguish confounders via expert prompts producing JSON outputs with confidence and descriptions. The dataset comprises 1,207 validated WWTP locations (198 UAE, 354 KSA, 655 Egypt) and equal non-WWTP sites from field/AI data, as 600mx600m Geo-TIFF images (Zoom 18, EPSG:4326). Zero-shot evaluations on WWTP images showed several VLMs out-performing YOLOv8's true positive rate, with Gemma-3 highest. Results confirm that VLMs, particularly with zero-shot, can replace YOLOv8 for efficient, annotation-free WWTP classification, enabling scalable remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Dong, Jie Zhang, Guoying Zhao, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Shuai Dong, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyeol Yun, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Shuai Dong, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhe Zhang, Yijie Zhou, Weizhan Zhang, Caixia Yan, Haipeng Du, yugui xie, Yu-Hui Wen, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanglong Fan, Yunqiao Yang, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their decision-making processes remain opaque. Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankita Raj, Kaashika Prajaapat, Tapan Kumar Gandhi, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Koch, Johanna Wald, Hide Matsuki, Pedro Hermosilla, Timo Ropinski, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding involves capturing and parsing unstructured 3D environments. Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) based on vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are widely believed to be incapable of representing high-frequency content. This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

<p>Abstract: In dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) systems, state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods often fail under significant viewpoint deviations, producing unstable and unrealistic renderings. To address this, we introduce Expanded Dynamic NeRF (ExpanDyNeRF), a monocular NeRF framework that leverages Gaussian splatting priors and a pseudo-ground-truth generation strategy to enable realistic synthesis under large-angle rotations. ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives. We also present the Synthetic Dynamic Multiview (SynDM) dataset, the first synthetic multiview dataset for dynamic scenes with explicit side-view supervision-created using a custom GTA V-based rendering pipeline. Quantitative and qualitative results on SynDM and real-world datasets demonstrate that ExpanDyNeRF significantly outperforms existing dynamic NeRF methods in rendering fidelity under extreme viewpoint shifts.

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mischa Dombrowski, Felix N\"utzel, Bernhard Kainz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Fanyue Wei, Runze Xu, Jingjing Li, Lixin Duan, Angela Yao, Wen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Cai, Hao Jiang, Xiaojun Yuan, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tunnels are essential elements of transportation infrastructure, but are increasingly affected by ageing and deterioration mechanisms such as cracking. Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiheng Zhao, Zilong Huang, Jiashi Feng, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Huang, Junhong Chen, Anqi Ning, Zhanhong Liang, Nick Michiels, Luc Claesen, Wenyin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Lolos, Theofilos Christodoulou, Aris L. Moustakas, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou</p>
<p>Abstract: In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Xu, Benxiang Zhai, Yunzhuo Sun, Ming Li, Yang Li, Sidan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14550">TAT: Task-Adaptive Transformer for All-in-One Medical Image Restoration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen Yang, Jiaju Zhang, Yang Yi, Jian Liang, Bingzheng Wei, Yan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianwei Cao, Dou Quan, Shuang Wang, Ning Huyan, Wei Wang, Yunan Li, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization (IRCVGL) aims to match images captured from significantly different viewpoints, such as satellite and street-level images. Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitsuki Watanabe, Sosuke Amano, Kiyoharu Aizawa, Yoko Yamakata</p>
<p>Abstract: Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhao, Yingxue Xu, Fengtao Zhou, Yihui Wang, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), multi-object tracking is primarily based on frame-based cameras. However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaolun Li, Jichang Li, Yinqi Cai, Junye Chen, Xiaonan Luo, Guanbin Li, Rushi Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Zhao, Haoxuan Wang, Kai Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Yuan Hong, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wu, Marcel Dreier, Nora Gourmelon, Sebastian Wind, Jianlin Zhang, Thorsten Seehaus, Matthias Braun, Andreas Maier, Vincent Christlein</p>
<p>Abstract: The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihong Wang, Liangqi Li, Weiwei Feng, Jiamin Wu, Changtao Miao, Tieru Wu, Rui Ma, Bo Zhang, Zhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Blanchini, Giovanna Maria Dimitri, Benedetta Tondi, Tarcisio Lancioni, Mauro Barni</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Sentiment Analysis (VSA) is a challenging task due to the vast diversity of emotionally salient images and the inherent difficulty of acquiring sufficient data to capture this variability comprehensively. Key obstacles include building large-scale VSA datasets and developing effective methodologies that enable algorithms to identify emotionally significant elements within an image. These challenges are reflected in the limited generalization performance of VSA algorithms and models when trained and tested across different datasets. Starting from a pool of existing data collections, our approach enables the creation of a new larger dataset that not only contains a wider variety of images than the original ones, but also permits training new models with improved capability to focus on emotionally relevant combinations of image elements. This is achieved through the integration of the semiotic isotopy concept within the dataset creation process, providing deeper insights into the emotional content of images. Empirical evaluations show that models trained on a dataset generated with our method consistently outperform those trained on the original data collections, achieving superior generalization across major VSA benchmarks</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ART, Articulated Reconstruction Transformer -- a category-agnostic, feed-forward model that reconstructs complete 3D articulated objects from only sparse, multi-state RGB images. Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Xu, Guojun Chen, Jiaolong Yang, Yizhong Zhang, Yu Deng, Steve Lin, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose VASA-3D, an audio-driven, single-shot 3D head avatar generator. This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng Xiang, Xiaoxue Chen, Sicheng Xu, Ruicheng Wang, Zelong Lv, Yu Deng, Hongyuan Zhu, Yue Dong, Hao Zhao, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Jiaolong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generative modeling have significantly improved the generation realism, yet the field is still hampered by existing representations, which struggle to capture assets with complex topologies and detailed appearance. This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Jiashun Wang, Jeff Tan, Yiwen Zhao, Jessica Hodgins, Shubham Tulsiani, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhao, Hanwen Jiang, Zhenlin Xu, Chutong Yang, Ehsan Adeli, Philipp Kr\"ahenb\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-parametric quantization has received much attention due to its efficiency on parameters and scalability to a large codebook. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding. The geometry of lattice codes explains the necessity of auxiliary loss terms when training auto-encoders with certain existing lookup-free quantization variants such as BSQ. As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\Lambda_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits. The improvement also extends to state-of-the-art auto-regressive image generation frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhang, Teng Wang, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Xinhao Li, Ying Shan, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Shuai Yang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Xu, Jiahao Cui, Feipeng Cai, Zhihao Zhu, Hanlin Shang, Shan Luan, Mingwang Xu, Neng Zhang, Yaoyi Li, Jia Cai, Siyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingwang Xu, Jiahao Cui, Feipeng Cai, Hanlin Shang, Zhihao Zhu, Shan Luan, Yifang Xu, Neng Zhang, Yaoyi Li, Jia Cai, Siyu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

<p>Abstract: Heat pump systems are critical components in modern energy-efficient buildings, yet their operational stress detection remains challenging due to complex thermodynamic interactions and limited real-world data. This paper presents a novel Physics-Guided Deep Neural Network (PG-DNN) approach for heat pump stress classification using the When2Heat dataset, containing 131,483 samples with 656 features across 26 European countries. The methodology integrates physics-guided feature selection and class definition with a deep neural network architecture featuring 5 hidden layers and dual regularization strategies. The model achieves 78.1\% test accuracy and 78.5% validation accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches: +5.0% over shallow networks, +4.0% over limited feature sets, and +2.0% over single regularization strategies. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of physics-guided feature selection, variable thresholding for realistic class distribution, and cross-country energy pattern analysis. The proposed system provides a production-ready solution for heat pump stress detection with 181,348 parameters and 720 seconds training time on AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with RTX 4080 hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Schnell, Aditya Makkar, Gunadi Gani, Aniket Srinivasan Ashok, Darren Lo, Mike Optis, Alexander Wong, Yuhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\times$ less than classical methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring contact pressure in hospital beds is essential for preventing pressure ulcers and enabling real-time patient assessment. Current methods can predict pressure maps but often lack physical plausibility, limiting clinical reliability. This work proposes a framework that enhances plausibility via Informed Latent Space (ILS) and Weight Optimization Loss (WOL) with generative modeling to produce high-fidelity, physically consistent pressure estimates. This study also applies diffusion based conditional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) and proposes training strategy for its latent counterpart Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (LBBDM) tailored for pressure synthesis in lying postures. Experiment results shows proposed method improves physical plausibility and performance over baselines: BBDM with ILS delivers highly detailed maps at higher computational cost and large inference time, whereas LBBDM provides faster inference with competitive performance. Overall, the approach supports non-invasive, vision-based, real-time patient monitoring in clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaiyuan Xiao, Fadi Dornaika, Jingjun Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of graph convolutional network (GCN)-based multi-view learning provides a powerful framework for integrating structural information from heterogeneous views, enabling effective modeling of complex multi-view data. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning for decoding EEG signals has gained traction, with many claims to state-of-the-art accuracy. However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The real-time deployment of cascaded generative AI pipelines for applications like video translation is constrained by significant system-level challenges. These include the cumulative latency of sequential model inference and the quadratic ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) computational complexity that renders multi-user video conferencing applications unscalable. This paper proposes and evaluates a practical system-level framework designed to mitigate these critical bottlenecks. The proposed architecture incorporates a turn-taking mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user scenarios, and a segmented processing protocol to manage inference latency for a perceptually real-time experience. We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($\tau < 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience. The work presents a validated, end-to-end system design that offers a practical roadmap for deploying scalable, real-time generative AI applications in multilingual communication platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Humaira Tasnim, Ashik E Rasul, Bruce Jo, Hyung-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable helipad detection is essential for Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) landing, especially under GPS-denied or visually degraded conditions. While modern detectors such as YOLOv8 offer strong baseline performance, single-model pipelines struggle to remain robust across the extreme scale transitions that occur during descent, where helipads appear small at high altitude and large near touchdown. To address this limitation, we propose a scale-adaptive dual-expert perception framework that decomposes the detection task into far-range and close-range regimes. Two YOLOv8 experts are trained on scale-specialized versions of the HelipadCat dataset, enabling one model to excel at detecting small, low-resolution helipads and the other to provide high-precision localization when the target dominates the field of view. During inference, both experts operate in parallel, and a geometric gating mechanism selects the expert whose prediction is most consistent with the AAV's viewpoint. This adaptive routing prevents the degradation commonly observed in single-detector systems when operating across wide altitude ranges. The dual-expert perception module is evaluated in a closed-loop landing environment that integrates CARLA's photorealistic rendering with NASA's GUAM flight-dynamics engine. Results show substantial improvements in alignment stability, landing accuracy, and overall robustness compared to single-detector baselines. By introducing a scale-aware expert routing strategy tailored to the landing problem, this work advances resilient vision-based perception for autonomous descent and provides a foundation for future multi-expert AAV frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yankai Jiang, Yujie Zhang, Peng Zhang, Yichen Li, Jintai Chen, Xiaoming Shi, Shihui Zhen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwei Sun, Xiaoning Lei, Wenhao Cai, Xichen Xu, Yanshu Wang, Hu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-based measures of image quality (IQ) are critical for evaluating medical imaging systems, which must account for randomness including anatomical variability. Stochastic object models (SOMs) provide a statistical description of such variability, but conventional mathematical SOMs fail to capture realistic anatomy, while data-driven approaches typically require clean data rarely available in clinical tasks. To address this challenge, we propose AMID, an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion with noise decoupling, which establishes clean SOMs directly from noisy measurements. AMID introduces a measurement-integrated strategy aligning measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, and explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, an ambient loss is thus designed base on it to learn clean SOMs. Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show that AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based IQ evaluation, demonstrating its potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georg Volk, J\"org Gamerdinger, Alexander von Bernuth, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Complete perception of the environment and its correct interpretation is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Object perception is the main component of automotive surround sensing. Various metrics already exist for the evaluation of object perception. However, objects can be of different importance depending on their velocity, orientation, distance, size, or the potential damage that could be caused by a collision due to a missed detection. Thus, these additional parameters have to be considered for safety evaluation. We propose a new safety metric that incorporates all these parameters and returns a single easily interpretable safety assessment score for object perception. This new metric is evaluated with both real world and virtual data sets and compared to state of the art metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Yuan, Zhikun Zhang, Linkang Du, Min Chen, Mingyang Sun, Yunjun Gao, Shibo He, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video recognition systems are increasingly being deployed in daily life, such as content recommendation and security monitoring. To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.
  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR. Finally, we show that VICTOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training videos or the target models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneha Sree C., Dattesh Shanbhag, Sudhanya Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for aligning anatomical structures across imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Among existing techniques, non-rigid registration (NRR) is particularly challenging due to the need to capture complex anatomical deformations caused by physiological processes like respiration or contrast-induced signal variations. Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for 3D non-rigid registration that generalizes across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on application-specific models, our approach eliminates anatomy- or modality-specific customization, enabling streamlined integration into diverse clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsuyuki Miyai, Shota Onohara, Jeonghun Baek, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14656">WaveSim: A Wavelet-based Multi-scale Similarity Metric for Weather and Climate Fields</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Accarino, Viviana Acquaviva, Sara Shamekh, Duncan Watson-Parris, David Lawrence</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce WaveSim, a multi-scale similarity metric for the evaluation of spatial fields in weather and climate applications. WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems. We provide a PyTorch-ready implementation of WaveSim, along with all evaluation scripts, at: https://github.com/gabrieleaccarino/wavesim.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Bai, Chen Gao, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyun Xu, Shujian Yu, Zhuoran Liu, Stjepan Picek</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a fundamental architecture and serve as the backbone of modern vision-language models. Despite their impressive performance, ViTs exhibit notable vulnerability to evasion attacks, necessitating the development of specialized Adversarial Training (AT) strategies tailored to their unique architecture. While a direct solution might involve applying existing AT methods to ViTs, our analysis reveals significant incompatibilities, particularly with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches such as Generalist (CVPR 2023) and DBAT (USENIX Security 2024). This paper presents a systematic investigation of adversarial robustness in ViTs and provides a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained via derived MI bounds. Building on this insight, we propose a self-supervised AT method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate adversarial pre-training by masked image modeling with autoencoders. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that MIMIR can consistently provide improved natural and robust accuracy, where MIMIR outperforms SOTA AT results on ImageNet-1K. Notably, MIMIR demonstrates superior robustness against unforeseen attacks and common corruption data and can also withstand adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses full knowledge of the defense mechanism.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\"org Gamerdinger, Sven Teufel, Stephan Amann, Georg Volk, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive perception of the vehicle's environment and correct interpretation of the environment are crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. The perception of surrounding objects is the main component for further tasks such as trajectory planning. However, safe trajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detection of drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider an advanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lane detection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metrics for object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene with road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential causes of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be considered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane Safety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to evaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily interpretable safety score. We evaluate our offline safety metric on various virtual scenarios using different lane detection approaches and compare it with state-of-the-art performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianping Ma, Xiaokang Zhang, Man-On Pun, Bo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing data, acquired from diverse sensors, offer a comprehensive and integrated perspective of the Earth's surface. Leveraging multimodal fusion techniques, semantic segmentation enables detailed and accurate analysis of geographic scenes, surpassing single-modality approaches. Building on advancements in vision foundation models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this study proposes a unified framework incorporating a novel Multimodal Fine-tuning Network (MFNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation. The proposed framework is designed to seamlessly integrate with various fine-tuning mechanisms, demonstrated through the inclusion of Adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as representative examples. This extensibility ensures the framework's adaptability to other emerging fine-tuning strategies, allowing models to retain SAM's general knowledge while effectively leveraging multimodal data. Additionally, a pyramid-based Deep Fusion Module (DFM) is introduced to integrate high-level geographic features across multiple scales, enhancing feature representation prior to decoding. This work also highlights SAM's robust generalization capabilities with Digital Surface Model (DSM) data, a novel application. Extensive experiments on three benchmark multimodal remote sensing datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam and MMHunan, demonstrate that the proposed MFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in multimodal semantic segmentation, setting a new standard in the field while offering a versatile foundation for future research and applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Mohamad, Francesco Ponzio, Santa Di Cataldo, Damien Ambrosetti, Xavier Descombes</p>
<p>Abstract: Renal Cell Carcinoma is typically asymptomatic at the early stages for many patients. This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring transferable 3D representations from unlabeled 3D point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple 3D primitives and augmentations.
  Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, such as shape classification, part segmentation, masked point cloud completion, and both scene semantic and instance segmentation. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural programs. Extensive experiments further suggest that current 3D self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment of forest biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem management and conservation. While traditional field surveys provide high-quality assessments, they are labor-intensive and spatially limited. This study investigates whether deep learning-based fusion of close-range sensing data from 2D orthophotos and 3D airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds can reliable assess the biodiversity potential of forests. We introduce the BioVista dataset, comprising 44378 paired samples of orthophotos and ALS point clouds from temperate forests in Denmark, designed to explore multimodal fusion approaches. Using deep neural networks (ResNet for orthophotos and PointVector for ALS point clouds), we investigate each data modality's ability to assess forest biodiversity potential, achieving overall accuracies of 76.7% and 75.8%, respectively. We explore various 2D and 3D fusion approaches: confidence-based ensembling, feature-level concatenation, and end-to-end training, with the latter achieving an overall accuracies of 82.0% when separating low- and high potential forest areas. Our results demonstrate that spectral information from orthophotos and structural information from ALS point clouds effectively complement each other in the assessment of forest biodiversity potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominick Reilly, Manish Kumar Govind, Le Xue, Srijan Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance across diverse video understanding tasks. However, their viewpoint invariant training limits their ability to understand egocentric properties (e.g., human object interactions) from exocentric video observations. This limitation is critical for many applications, such as Activities of Daily Living (ADL) monitoring, where the understanding of egocentric properties is essential, and egocentric cameras are impractical to deploy. To address this limitation, we propose Ego2ExoVLM, a VLM that learns to infer egocentric properties from exocentric videos by leveraging time-synchronized ego-exo videos during training. Ego2ExoVLM accomplishes this through the use of two components: Ego2Exo Sequence Distillation, which transfers knowledge from an egocentric teacher to an exocentric student, and Ego Adaptive Visual Tokens, designed to enhance the effectiveness of this knowledge transfer. To measure this capability, we introduce Ego-in-Exo Perception, a benchmark of 3.9K questions curated to explicitly measure the understanding of egocentric properties from exocentric videos. Ego2ExoVLM is evaluated on 10 tasks across Ego-in-Exo Perception and existing ADL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ADL-X benchmark suite and outperforming strong baselines on our proposed benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Lu, Xue Yang, Si-Bao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Light-weight neural networks for remote sensing (RS) visual analysis must overcome two inherent redundancies: spatial redundancy from vast, homogeneous backgrounds, and channel redundancy, where extreme scale variations render a single feature space inefficient. Existing models, often designed for natural images, fail to address this dual challenge in RS scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose LWGANet, a light-weight backbone engineered for RS-specific properties. LWGANet introduces two core innovations: a Top-K Global Feature Interaction (TGFI) module that mitigates spatial redundancy by focusing computation on salient regions, and a Light-Weight Grouped Attention (LWGA) module that resolves channel redundancy by partitioning channels into specialized, scale-specific pathways. By synergistically resolving these core inefficiencies, LWGANet achieves a superior trade-off between feature representation quality and computational cost. Extensive experiments on twelve diverse datasets across four major RS tasks--scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection--demonstrate that LWGANet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight backbones in both accuracy and efficiency. Our work establishes a new, robust baseline for efficient visual analysis in RS images.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI personal assistants, deployed through robots or wearables, require embodied understanding to collaborate effectively with humans. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GASPACHO, a method for generating photorealistic, controllable renderings of human-object interactions from multi-view RGB video. Unlike prior work that reconstructs only the human and treats objects as background, GASPACHO simultaneously recovers animatable templates for both the human and the interacting object as distinct sets of Gaussians, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. We introduce a novel formulation that learns object Gaussians on an underlying 2D surface manifold rather than in 3D volume, yielding sharper, fine-grained object details for dynamic object reconstruction. We further propose a contact constraint in Gaussian space that regularizes human-object relations and enables natural, physically plausible animation. Across three benchmarks - BEHAVE, NeuralDome, and DNA-Rendering - GASPACHO achieves high-quality reconstructions under heavy occlusion and supports controllable synthesis of novel human-object interactions. We also demonstrate that our method allows for composition of humans and objects in 3D scenes and for the first time showcase that neural rendering can be used for the controllable generation of photoreal humans interacting with dynamic objects in diverse scenes.

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoung Kim, Mahmoud Afifi, Dongyun Kim, Michael S. Brown, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational color constancy, or white balancing, is a key module in a camera's image signal processor (ISP) that corrects color casts from scene lighting. Because this operation occurs in the camera-specific raw color space, white balance algorithms must adapt to different cameras. This paper introduces a learning-based method for cross-camera color constancy that generalizes to new cameras without retraining. Our method leverages pre-calibrated color correction matrices (CCMs) available on ISPs that map the camera's raw color space to a standard space (e.g., CIE XYZ). Our method uses these CCMs to transform predefined illumination colors (i.e., along the Planckian locus) into the test camera's raw space. The mapped illuminants are encoded into a compact camera fingerprint embedding (CFE) that enables the network to adapt to unseen cameras. To prevent overfitting due to limited cameras and CCMs during training, we introduce a data augmentation technique that interpolates between cameras and their CCMs. Experimental results across multiple datasets and backbones show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-camera color constancy while remaining lightweight and relying only on data readily available in camera ISPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Pellegrini, Davide Cozzolino, Serafino Pandolfini, Davide Maltoni, Matteo Ferrara, Luisa Verdoliva, Marco Prati, Marco Ramilli</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has revolutionized image creation, enabling high-quality synthesis from text prompts while raising critical challenges for media authenticity. We present Ai-GenBench, a novel benchmark designed to address the urgent need for robust detection of AI-generated images in real-world scenarios. Unlike existing solutions that evaluate models on static datasets, Ai-GenBench introduces a temporal evaluation framework where detection methods are incrementally trained on synthetic images, historically ordered by their generative models, to test their ability to generalize to new generative models, such as the transition from GANs to diffusion models. Our benchmark focuses on high-quality, diverse visual content and overcomes key limitations of current approaches, including arbitrary dataset splits, unfair comparisons, and excessive computational demands. Ai-GenBench provides a comprehensive dataset, a standardized evaluation protocol, and accessible tools for both researchers and non-experts (e.g., journalists, fact-checkers), ensuring reproducibility while maintaining practical training requirements. By establishing clear evaluation rules and controlled augmentation strategies, Ai-GenBench enables meaningful comparison of detection methods and scalable solutions. Code and data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility and to support the development of robust forensic detectors to keep pace with the rise of new synthetic generators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Liu, Zhongliang Liu, Junwei Shu, Changbo Wang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to 3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and 3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at https://vpx-ecnu.github.io/GT2-GS-website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tania Chakraborty, Eylon Caplan, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the performance of several VLMs on it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruobei Zhang, Shengeng Tang, Huan Yan, Xiang Zhang, Jiabao Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sisi Dai, Xinxin Su, Ruizhen Hu, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic 3D (4D) content generation, particularly text-to-4D, remains a challenging and under-explored problem due to its inherent spatiotemporal complexity. Existing text-to-4D methods typically avoid direct mesh generation due to inherent topological constraints, favoring alternative representations like NeRFs or 3DGS. However, these non-mesh approaches, suffer from insufficient geometric fidelity, temporal artifacts, and limited compatibility with modern computer graphics (CG) pipelines. In contrast, directly generating dynamic meshes faces two key challenges: i) deformation inflexibility, as traditional vertex-based optimization is constrained by meshes' explicitly encoded topology, and ii) semantic inconsistency, arising from stochastic noise in distilled priors.
  In this paper, we introduce TextMesh4D, a pioneering framework for text-to-4D mesh generation that directly addresses these challenges. TextMesh4D features two core innovations: 1) the Jacobian Deformation Field (JDF), which shifts the deformation unit from vertices to faces, using per-face Jacobians to model flexible transformations free from topological constraints. 2) the Local-Global Semantic Regularizer (LGSR), which leverages the mesh's innate geometric properties to enforce semantic coherence both locally and globally across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in temporal consistency, structural fidelity, and visual realism, while requiring only a single 24GB GPU. Our work establishes a new benchmark for efficient and high-quality text-to-4D mesh generation. The code will be released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ourui Fu, Hangzhou He, Kaiwen Li, Xinliang Zhang, Lei Zhu, Shuang Zeng, Zhaoheng Xie, Yanye Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation rely on large-scale annotated datasets, leading to an annotation bottleneck that motivates few shot semantic segmentation (FSS) which aims to generalize to novel classes with minimal labeled exemplars. Most existing FSS methods adopt a prototype-based paradigm, which generates query prior map by extracting masked-area features from support images and then makes predictions guided by the prior map. However, they suffer from two critical limitations induced by inter- and intra-image discrepancies: 1) The intra-class gap between support and query images, caused by single-prototype representation, results in scattered and noisy prior maps; 2) The inter-class interference from visually similar but semantically distinct regions leads to inconsistent support-query feature matching and erroneous predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Inter- and Intra-image Refinement (IIR) model. The model contains an inter-image class activation mapping based method that generates two prototypes for class-consistent region matching, including core discriminative features and local specific features, and yields an accurate and robust prior map. For intra-image refinement, a directional dropout mechanism is introduced to mask inconsistent support-query feature pairs in cross attention, thereby enhancing decoder performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 benchmarks, covering standard FSS, part FSS, and cross-domain FSS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Wu, Yunqing Shang, Chen Xu, Hai Song, Chong Wang, Qixing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations, particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection models.

<p>Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow has the potential to combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, our method achieved a high Dice score of 82.64, and a low Hausdorff distance of 6.34 pixels was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-U/Mamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37.79% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001), and surpassed the purely image-based XLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 2.58% and 1.01%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanshika Vats, Ashwani Rathee, James Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyun Im, SuBeen Lee, Miso Lee, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To extract discriminative representations from the limited labeled set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using algorithms such as farthest point sampling (FPS). However, we point out that this convention has undesirable effects as performance fluctuates depending on sampling, while the prototype generation process remains underexplored in the field. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla attention module suffers from the distributional gap between prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the features to tokens before the attention process, and coloring subsequently restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating prototypes that capture the semantic relationships in support features. WARM achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on FS-PCS benchmarks, and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM) serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists, and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating RGB-A videos, which include alpha channels for transparency, has wide applications. However, current methods often suffer from low quality due to confusion between RGB and alpha. In this paper, we address this problem by learning shiftable RGB-A distributions. We adjust both the latent space and noise space, shifting the alpha distribution outward while preserving the RGB distribution, thereby enabling stable transparency generation without compromising RGB quality. Specifically, for the latent space, we propose a transparency-aware bidirectional diffusion loss during VAE training, which shifts the RGB-A distribution according to likelihood. For the noise space, we propose shifting the mean of diffusion noise sampling and applying a Gaussian ellipse mask to provide transparency guidance and controllability. Additionally, we construct a high-quality RGB-A video dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our model excels in visual quality, naturalness, transparency rendering, inference convenience, and controllability.

<p>Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Shahi, Anup Bagale</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models including a Vision Transformer under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V2 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations in this study confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.</p>

In this work, we present VesSAM, a powerful and efficient framework tailored for 2D vessel segmentation. VesSAM integrates (1) a convolutional adapter to enhance local texture features, (2) a multi-prompt encoder that fuses anatomical prompts, including skeletons, bifurcation points, and segment midpoints, via hierarchical cross-attention, and (3) a lightweight mask decoder to reduce jagged artifacts. We also introduce an automated pipeline to generate structured multi-prompt annotations, and curate a diverse benchmark dataset spanning 8 datasets across 5 imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that VesSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT-based SAM variants by over 10% Dice and 13% IoU, and achieves competitive performance compared to fully fine-tuned methods, with significantly fewer parameters. VesSAM also generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OoD) settings, outperforming all baselines in average OoD Dice and IoU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derong Kong, Zhixiong Yang, Shengxi Li, Shuaifeng Zhi, Li Liu, Zhen Liu, Jingyuan Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) faces persistent challenges in balancing reconstruction fidelity with cross-scenario generalization. While existing methods predominantly focus on deterministic pixel-level mappings between paired low/normal-light images, they often neglect the continuous physical process of luminance transitions in real-world environments, leading to performance drop when normal-light references are unavailable. Inspired by empirical analysis of natural luminance dynamics revealing power-law distributed intensity transitions, this paper introduces Luminance-Aware Statistical Quantification (LASQ), a novel framework that reformulates LLIE as a statistical sampling process over hierarchical luminance distributions. Our LASQ re-conceptualizes luminance transition as a power-law distribution in intensity coordinate space that can be approximated by stratified power functions, therefore, replacing deterministic mappings with probabilistic sampling over continuous luminance layers. A diffusion forward process is designed to autonomously discover optimal transition paths between luminance layers, achieving unsupervised distribution emulation without normal-light references. In this way, it considerably improves the performance in practical situations, enabling more adaptable and versatile light restoration. This framework is also readily applicable to cases with normal-light references, where it achieves superior performance on domain-specific datasets alongside better generalization-ability across non-reference datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilong Zhou, Jianchun Chen, Pramod Rao, Timo Teufel, Linjie Lyu, Tigran Minasian, Oleksandr Sotnychenko, Xiao-Xiao Long, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data. The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robinson Umeike, Neil Getty, Yin Xiangyu, Yi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images that often capture ecological context on behaviors, interactions, phenology, and habitat. Yet most ecological workflows rely on metadata filtering or manual inspection, leaving this secondary information inaccessible at scale. We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that enables scientists to rapidly and interactively search within an ecological image database for specific concepts using natural language, verify and export relevant observations, and utilize this discovered data for novel scientific analysis. Compared to traditional methods, INQUIRE-Search takes a fraction of the time, opening up new possibilities for scientific questions that can be explored. Through five case studies, we show the diversity of scientific applications that a tool like INQUIRE-Search can support, from seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples demonstrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we emphasize using such AI-enabled discovery tools for science call for experts to reframe the priorities of the scientific process and develop novel methods for experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian B\"urger, Martim Dias Gomes, Nica Gutu, Adri\'an E. Granada, No\'emie Moreau, Katarzyna Bozek</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Jin, Qingyuan Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Yang Liu, Sijie Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra long video understanding remains an open challenge, as existing vision language models (VLMs) falter on such content due to limited context length and inefficient long term memory retention. To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04576">TARDis: Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement for Incomplete Multi-Modal Tumor Segmentation and Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Wan, Qinqin Kang, Na Li, Yi Huang, Qianru Zhang, Le Lu, Yun Bian, Dawei Ding, Ke Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate diagnosis and segmentation of tumors in contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) are fundamentally driven by the distinctive hemodynamic profiles of contrast agents over time. However, in real-world clinical practice, complete temporal dynamics are often hard to capture by strict radiation dose limits and inconsistent acquisition protocols across institutions, leading to a prevalent missing modality problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. We first hypothesize that the latent feature can be disentangled into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Hemodynamic Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to infer missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-modal private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 patients) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) has advanced open-vocabulary segmentation through promptable concept segmentation, allowing users to segment all instances corresponding to a given concept, typically specified with short noun-phrase (NP) prompts. While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here.</p>

<p>Abstract: VR sketching lets users explore and iterate on ideas directly in 3D, offering a faster and more intuitive alternative to conventional CAD tools. However, existing sketch-to-shape models ignore the temporal ordering of strokes, discarding crucial cues about structure and design intent. We introduce VRSketch2Shape, the first framework and multi-category dataset for generating 3D shapes from sequential VR sketches. Our contributions are threefold: (i) an automated pipeline that generates sequential VR sketches from arbitrary shapes, (ii) a dataset of over 20k synthetic and 900 hand-drawn sketch-shape pairs across four categories, and (iii) an order-aware sketch encoder coupled with a diffusion-based 3D generator. Our approach yields higher geometric fidelity than prior work, generalizes effectively from synthetic to real sketches with minimal supervision, and performs well even on partial sketches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhuo Mao, Hongtao Zou, Qihu Xie, Song Chen, Yi Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilong Jin, Haoran Duan, Litao Hua, Wentao Huang, Yuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animal tracking and pose estimation systems, such as STEP (Simultaneous Tracking and Pose Estimation) and ViTPose, experience substantial performance drops when processing images and videos with cage structures and systematic occlusions. We present a three-stage preprocessing pipeline that addresses this limitation through: (1) cage segmentation using a Gabor-enhanced ResNet-UNet architecture with tunable orientation filters, (2) cage inpainting using CRFill for content-aware reconstruction of occluded regions, and (3) evaluation of pose estimation and tracking on the uncaged frames. Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods. Experimental validation demonstrates that removing cage occlusions through our pipeline enables pose estimation and tracking performance comparable to that in environments without occlusions. We also observe significant improvements in keypoint detection accuracy and trajectory consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quality and diversity of instruction-based image editing datasets are continuously increasing, yet large-scale, high-quality datasets for instruction-based video editing remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce OpenVE-3M, an open-source, large-scale, and high-quality dataset for instruction-based video editing. It comprises two primary categories: spatially-aligned edits (Global Style, Background Change, Local Change, Local Remove, Local Add, and Subtitles Edit) and non-spatially-aligned edits (Camera Multi-Shot Edit and Creative Edit). All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07829">One Layer Is Enough: Adapting Pretrained Visual Encoders for Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Chen Chen, Tianrong Chen, Jiatao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.</p>

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbf{\Sigma}_{obs} = \mathbf{\Sigma}_{HR} + \mathbf{\Sigma}_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Guillen-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Adebi, Sagnik Majumder, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding camera motion is a fundamental problem in embodied perception and 3D scene understanding. While visual methods have advanced rapidly, they often struggle under visually degraded conditions such as motion blur or occlusions. In this work, we show that passive scene sounds provide complementary cues for relative camera pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. We introduce a simple but effective audio-visual framework that integrates direction-ofarrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model. Our results on two large datasets show consistent gains over strong visual baselines, plus robustness when the visual information is corrupted. To our knowledge, this represents the first work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos, and it establishes incidental, everyday audio as an unexpected but promising signal for a classic spatial challenge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengkai Xu, Hsiang Lun Kao, Tianxiang Xu, Honghui Zhang, Junqiao Wang, Runmeng Ding, Guanyu Liu, Tianyu Shi, Zhenyu Yu, Guofeng Pan, Ziqian Bi, Yuqi Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets often underperform in real-world endoscopy, where illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions degrade image quality. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline. This combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, thereby reducing the risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Yiwei Wang, Songze Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianchao Guan, Zhiyuan Fan, Yifeng Wang, Fuqiang Chen, Yanjiang Zhou, Zengyang Che, Hongxue Meng, Xin Li, Yaowei Wang, Hongpeng Wang, Min Zhang, Heng Tao Shen, Zheng Zhang, Yongbing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of clinical-grade artificial intelligence in pathology is limited by the scarcity of diverse, high-quality annotated datasets. Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Hou, Wei-Hsing Huang, Shaofeng Liang, Daizong Liu, Tai-Hao Wen, Gang Wang, Runwei Guan, Weiping Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Chengqun Yang, Zhuo Su, Zheng Lv, Jingnan Gao, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Xiaokang Yang, Yichao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Face relighting aims to synthesize realistic portraits under novel illumination while preserving identity and geometry. However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining "chicken-and-egg" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Wang, Weijia Wu, Yi Zhan, Rui Zhao, Ming Hu, James Cheng, Wei Liu, Philip Torr, Kevin Qinghong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Liu, Qiao Qin, Qinghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has increased the demand for generated image detectors capable of generalizing across diverse and evolving generation techniques. However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anran Qi, Changjian Li, Adrien Bousseau, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow. Code will be released on acceptance. Project page: https://anranqi.github.io/beyond-visible.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhang, Ziqi Zhang, Zongyang Ma, Yuxin Chen, Bing Li, Chunfeng Yuan, Guangting Wang, Fengyun Rao, Ying Shan, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Fu, Diankun Zhang, Zongchuang Zhao, Jianfeng Cui, Hongwei Xie, Bing Wang, Guang Chen, Dingkang Liang, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Song, Thomas Anderson Keller, Yisong Yue, Pietro Perona, Max Welling</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a vast literature on representation learning based on principles such as coding efficiency, statistical independence, causality, controllability, or symmetry. In this paper we propose to learn representations from sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables into sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent activations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before being decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed into a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of potential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small number of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with which the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is completely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a new form of disentangled representations where the input is not only represented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination of independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When viewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning approximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this model achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and unsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxuan Li, Jiahao Wu, Yuan Xu, Zezheng Zhu, Yunxiang Zhang, Kenneth Chen, Yanqi Liang, Nanfang Yu, Qi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth foundation models offer strong learned priors for 3D perception but lack physical depth cues, leading to ambiguities in metric scale. We introduce a birefringent metalens -- a planar nanophotonic lens composed of subwavelength pixels for wavefront shaping with a thickness of 700 nm and a diameter of 3 mm -- to physically prompt depth foundation models. In a single monocular shot, our metalens physically embeds depth information into two polarized optical wavefronts, which we decode through a lightweight prompting and fine-tuning framework that aligns depth foundation models with the optical signals. To scale the training data, we develop a light wave propagation simulator that synthesizes metalens responses from RGB-D datasets, incorporating key physical factors to minimize the sim-to-real gap. Simulated and physical experiments with our fabricated titanium-dioxide metalens demonstrate accurate and consistent metric depth over state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators. The research demonstrates that nanophotonic wavefront formation offers a promising bridge for grounding depth foundation models in physical depth sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Shurrab, Aadim Nepal, Terrence J. Lee-St. John, Nicola G. Ghazi, Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, Farah E. Shamout</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyang Zhou, Fang-Lue Zhang, Zichen Wang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moein Heidari, Mohammad Amin Roohi, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11811">Enhancing Geo-localization for Crowdsourced Flood Imagery via LLM-Guided Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyi Xu, Jun Ma, Waishan Qiu, Cui Guo, Jack C. P. Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing image geo-localization approaches, also known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models, exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geo-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Malekzadeh, Magdalena Biernacka, Elias Willberg, Jussi Torkko, Edyta {\L}aszkiewicz, Tuuli Toivonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding greenspace attractiveness is essential for designing livable and inclusive urban environments, yet existing assessment approaches often overlook informal or transient spaces and remain too resource intensive to capture subjective perceptions at scale. This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11831">On the Design of One-step Diffusion via Shortcutting Flow Paths</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Lin, Peiyan Hu, Minsi Ren, Zhifeng Gao, Zhi-Ming Ma, Guolin ke, Tailin Wu, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in few-step diffusion models have demonstrated their efficiency and effectiveness by shortcutting the probabilistic paths of diffusion models, especially in training one-step diffusion models from scratch (\emph{a.k.a.} shortcut models). However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting with one step generation, and further reaches FID50k of 2.52 with 2x training steps. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space.</p>
