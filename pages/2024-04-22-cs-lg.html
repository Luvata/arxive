<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed A. Allayla, Serkan Ayvaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Online social media platforms have recently become integral to our society and daily routines. Every day, users worldwide spend a couple of hours on such platforms, expressing their sentiments and emotional state and contacting each other. Analyzing such huge amounts of data from these platforms can provide a clear insight into public sentiments and help detect their mental status. The early identification of these health condition risks may assist in preventing or reducing the number of suicide ideation and potentially saving people's lives. The traditional techniques have become ineffective in processing such streams and large-scale datasets. Therefore, the paper proposed a new methodology based on a big data architecture to predict suicidal ideation from social media content. The proposed approach provides a practical analysis of social media data in two phases: batch processing and real-time streaming prediction. The batch dataset was collected from the Reddit forum and used for model building and training, while streaming big data was extracted using Twitter streaming API and used for real-time prediction. After the raw data was preprocessed, the extracted features were fed to multiple Apache Spark ML classifiers: NB, LR, LinearSVC, DT, RF, and MLP. We conducted various experiments using various feature-extraction techniques with different testing scenarios. The experimental results of the batch processing phase showed that the features extracted of (Unigram + Bigram) + CV-IDF with MLP classifier provided high performance for classifying suicidal ideation, with an accuracy of 93.47%, and then applied for real-time streaming prediction phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meghana Velegar, Christoph Keller, J. Nathan Kutz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jifeng Guo, Zhulin Liu, Tong Zhang, C. L. Philip Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning provides a solution to reduce the dependency of machine learning on labeled data. As one of the efficient semi-supervised techniques, self-training (ST) has received increasing attention. Several advancements have emerged to address challenges associated with noisy pseudo-labels. Previous works on self-training acknowledge the importance of unlabeled data but have not delved into their efficient utilization, nor have they paid attention to the problem of high time consumption caused by iterative learning. This paper proposes Incremental Self-training (IST) for semi-supervised learning to fill these gaps. Unlike ST, which processes all data indiscriminately, IST processes data in batches and priority assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples with high certainty. Then, it processes the data around the decision boundary after the model is stabilized, enhancing classifier performance. Our IST is simple yet effective and fits existing self-training-based semi-supervised learning methods. We verify the proposed IST on five datasets and two types of backbone, effectively improving the recognition accuracy and learning speed. Significantly, it outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on three challenging image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Xiao, Dan Liu, Kevin Credit</p>
<p>Abstract: Building Energy Rating (BER) stands as a pivotal metric, enabling building owners, policymakers, and urban planners to understand the energy-saving potential through improving building energy efficiency. As such, enhancing buildings' BER levels is expected to directly contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and promote climate improvement. Nonetheless, the BER assessment process is vulnerable to missing and inaccurate measurements. In this study, we introduce \texttt{CLEAR}, a data-driven approach designed to scrutinize the inconsistencies in BER assessments through self-supervised contrastive learning. We validated the effectiveness of \texttt{CLEAR} using a dataset representing Irish building stocks. Our experiments uncovered evidence of inconsistent BER assessments, highlighting measurement data corruption within this real-world dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Cheng, Ziyi Zhou, Bowen Zhang, Ziyu Wang, Jiaqi Gan, Ziang Ren, Weiqi Feng, Yi Lyu, Hefan Zhang, Xingjian Diao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the landscape of spatio-temporal data analytics, effective trajectory representation learning is paramount. To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12401">Items or Relations -- what do Artificial Neural Networks learn?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Renate Krause, Stefan Reimann</p>
<p>Abstract: What has an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learned after being successfully trained to solve a task - the set of training items or the relations between them? This question is difficult to answer for modern applied ANNs because of their enormous size and complexity. Therefore, here we consider a low-dimensional network and a simple task, i.e., the network has to reproduce a set of training items identically. We construct the family of solutions analytically and use standard learning algorithms to obtain numerical solutions. These numerical solutions differ depending on the optimization algorithm and the weight initialization and are shown to be particular members of the family of analytical solutions. In this simple setting, we observe that the general structure of the network weights represents the training set's symmetry group, i.e., the relations between training items. As a consequence, linear networks generalize, i.e., reproduce items that were not part of the training set but are consistent with the symmetry of the training set. In contrast, non-linear networks tend to learn individual training items and show associative memory. At the same time, their ability to generalize is limited. A higher degree of generalization is obtained for networks whose activation function contains a linear regime, such as tanh. Our results suggest ANN's ability to generalize - instead of learning items - could be improved by generating a sufficiently big set of elementary operations to represent relations and strongly depends on the applied non-linearity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Rasetto, Himanshu Akolkar</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, a neuromorphic approach for feature extraction from event data, presents promising capabilities but faces challenges in accuracy and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we introduce Sup3r, a Semi-Supervised algorithm aimed at addressing these challenges. Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks. It enables end-to-end online training of HOTS networks replacing external classifiers, by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events. Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting. Preliminary results on N-MNIST demonstrate that Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized Artificial Neural Networks trained with back-propagation. This work showcases the potential of Sup3r to advance the capabilities of HOTS networks, offering a promising avenue for neuromorphic algorithms in real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12403">Multi-Objective Hardware Aware Neural Architecture Search using Hardware Cost Diversity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilotpal Sinha, Peyman Rostami, Abd El Rahman Shabayek, Anis Kacem, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search approaches (HW-NAS) automate the design of deep learning architectures, tailored specifically to a given target hardware platform. Yet, these techniques demand substantial computational resources, primarily due to the expensive process of assessing the performance of identified architectures. To alleviate this problem, a recent direction in the literature has employed representation similarity metric for efficiently evaluating architecture performance. Nonetheless, since it is inherently a single objective method, it requires multiple runs to identify the optimal architecture set satisfying the diverse hardware cost constraints, thereby increasing the search cost. Furthermore, simply converting the single objective into a multi-objective approach results in an under-explored architectural search space. In this study, we propose a Multi-Objective method to address the HW-NAS problem, called MO-HDNAS, to identify the trade-off set of architectures in a single run with low computational cost. This is achieved by optimizing three objectives: maximizing the representation similarity metric, minimizing hardware cost, and maximizing the hardware cost diversity. The third objective, i.e. hardware cost diversity, is used to facilitate a better exploration of the architecture search space. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in efficiently addressing the HW-NAS problem across six edge devices for the image classification task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in machine learning. This study introduces a simple yet effective method employing Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to generate synthetic data, specifically addressing data imbalance problems. We propose a novel group-wise prompting method in CSV-style formatting that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to produce data that closely adheres to the specified requirements and characteristics of the target dataset. Moreover, our proposed random word replacement strategy significantly improves the handling of monotonous categorical values, enhancing the accuracy and representativeness of the synthetic data. The effectiveness of our method is extensively validated across eight real-world public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in downstream classification and regression tasks while maintaining inter-feature correlations and improving token efficiency over existing approaches. This advancement significantly contributes to addressing the key challenges of machine learning applications, particularly in the context of tabular data generation and handling class imbalance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Bhatia, Felix Dangel</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory is a limiting resource for many deep learning tasks. Beside the neural network weights, one main memory consumer is the computation graph built up by automatic differentiation (AD) for backpropagation. We observe that PyTorch's current AD implementation neglects information about parameter differentiability when storing the computation graph. This information is useful though to reduce memory whenever gradients are requested for a parameter subset, as is the case in many modern fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, inputs to layers that act linearly in their parameters (dense, convolution, or normalization layers) can be discarded whenever the parameters are marked as non-differentiable. We provide a drop-in, differentiability-agnostic implementation of such layers and demonstrate its ability to reduce memory without affecting run time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayse Cakmak, Erik Reinertsen, Shamim Nemati, Gari D. Clifford</p>
<p>Abstract: The pattern of state changes in a biomedical time series can be related to health or disease. This work presents a principled approach for selecting a changepoint detection algorithm for a specific task, such as disease classification. Eight key algorithms were compared, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated as a function of temporal tolerance, noise, and abnormal conduction (ectopy) on realistic artificial cardiovascular time series data. All algorithms were applied to real data (cardiac time series of 22 patients with REM-behavior disorder (RBD) and 15 healthy controls) using the parameters selected on artificial data. Finally, features were derived from the detected changepoints to classify RBD patients from healthy controls using a K-Nearest Neighbors approach. On artificial data, Modified Bayesian Changepoint Detection algorithm provided superior positive predictive value for state change identification while Recursive Mean Difference Maximization (RMDM) achieved the highest true positive rate. For the classification task, features derived from the RMDM algorithm provided the highest leave one out cross validated accuracy of 0.89 and true positive rate of 0.87. Automatically detected changepoints provide useful information about subject's physiological state which cannot be directly observed. However, the choice of change point detection algorithm depends on the nature of the underlying data and the downstream application, such as a classification task. This work represents the first time change point detection algorithms have been compared in a meaningful way and utilized in a classification task, which demonstrates the effect of changepoint algorithm choice on application performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Chen, Pengfei Ou, Yuxin Chang, Hengrui Zhang, Xiao-Yan Li, Edward H. Sargent, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at some speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability and safety certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bartlomiej Sobieski, Przemys{\l}aw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite increasing progress in development of methods for generating visual counterfactual explanations, especially with the recent rise of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, previous works consider them as an entirely local technique. In this work, we take the first step at globalizing them. Specifically, we discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions. We propose a novel proxy-based approach that discovers two types of these directions with the use of only single image in an entirely black-box manner. Precisely, g-directions allow for flipping the decision of a given classifier on an entire dataset of images, while h-directions further increase the diversity of explanations. We refer to them in general as Global Counterfactual Directions (GCDs). Moreover, we show that GCDs can be naturally combined with Latent Integrated Gradients resulting in a new black-box attribution method, while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of counterfactual explanations. We validate our approach on existing benchmarks and show that it generalizes to real-world use-cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research paper delves into the innovative integration of Shannon entropy and rough set theory, presenting a novel approach to generalize the evaluation approach in machine learning. The conventional application of entropy, primarily focused on information uncertainty, is extended through its combination with rough set theory to offer a deeper insight into data's intrinsic structure and the interpretability of machine learning models. We introduce a comprehensive framework that synergizes the granularity of rough set theory with the uncertainty quantification of Shannon entropy, applied across a spectrum of machine learning algorithms. Our methodology is rigorously tested on various datasets, showcasing its capability to not only assess predictive performance but also to illuminate the underlying data complexity and model robustness. The results underscore the utility of this integrated approach in enhancing the evaluation landscape of machine learning, offering a multi-faceted perspective that balances accuracy with a profound understanding of data attributes and model dynamics. This paper contributes a groundbreaking perspective to machine learning evaluation, proposing a method that encapsulates a holistic view of model performance, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in model selection and application.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study both stream-based and pool-based active learning with neural network approximations. A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as $K$, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: "How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of $K$ while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning $K$ for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Seale Smith, Lazar Valkov, Shaunak Halbe, Vyshnavi Gutta, Rogerio Feris, Zsolt Kira, Leonid Karlinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have become the hallmark of modern AI, however, these models are trained on massive data, leading to financially expensive training. Updating FMs as new data becomes available is important, however, can lead to `catastrophic forgetting', where models underperform on tasks related to data sub-populations observed too long ago. This continual learning (CL) phenomenon has been extensively studied, but primarily in a setting where only a small amount of past data can be stored. We advocate for the paradigm where memory is abundant, allowing us to keep all previous data, but computational resources are limited. In this setting, traditional replay-based CL approaches are outperformed by a simple baseline which replays past data selected uniformly at random, indicating that this setting necessitates a new approach. We address this by introducing a framework of adaptive memory replay for continual learning, where sampling of past data is phrased as a multi-armed bandit problem. We utilize Bolzmann sampling to derive a method which dynamically selects past data for training conditioned on the current task, assuming full data access and emphasizing training efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on both vision and language pre-training tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which maintains high performance while reducing forgetting by up to 10% at no training efficiency cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Gong, Kecen Li, Jin Yao, Tianhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent from experiences interacting with the environment. In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Watson, Nicole Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, an overwhelming number of studies have focused on analyzing the post-generation phase - refining outputs via feedback, analyzing logit output values, or deriving clues via the outputs' artifacts. We propose HalluciBot, a model that predicts the probability of hallucination $\textbf{before generation}$, for any query imposed to an LLM. In essence, HalluciBot does not invoke any generation during inference. To derive empirical evidence for HalluciBot, we employ a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Simulation using a Query Perturbator to craft $n$ variations per query at train time. The construction of our Query Perturbator is motivated by our introduction of a new definition of hallucination - $\textit{truthful hallucination}$. Our training methodology generated 2,219,022 estimates for a training corpus of 369,837 queries, spanning 13 diverse datasets and 3 question-answering scenarios. HalluciBot predicts both binary and multi-class probabilities of hallucination, enabling a means to judge the query's quality with regards to its propensity to hallucinate. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to revise or cancel a query before generation and the ensuing computational waste. Moreover, it provides a lucid means to measure user accountability for hallucinatory queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Zaker Esteghamati, Brennan Bean, Henry V. Burton, M. Z. Naser</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based solutions are rapidly changing the landscape of many fields, including structural engineering. Despite their promising performance, these approaches are usually only demonstrated as proof-of-concept in structural engineering, and are rarely deployed for real-world applications. This paper aims to illustrate the challenges of developing ML models suitable for deployment through two illustrative examples. Among various pitfalls, the presented discussion focuses on model overfitting and underspecification, training data representativeness, variable omission bias, and cross-validation. The results highlight the importance of implementing rigorous model validation techniques through adaptive sampling, careful physics-informed feature selection, and considerations of both model complexity and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhong Wang, Qingyuan Zeng, Wanyu Lin, Min Jiang, Kay Chen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12575">On the use of adversarial validation for quantifying dissimilarity in geospatial machine learning prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwen Wang, Mahdi Khodadadzadeh, Raul Zurita-Milla</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent geospatial machine learning studies have shown that the results of model evaluation via cross-validation (CV) are strongly affected by the dissimilarity between the sample data and the prediction locations. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify such a dissimilarity in the interval 0 to 100%, and from the perspective of the data feature space. The proposed method is based on adversarial validation, which is an approach that can check whether sample data and prediction locations can be separated with a binary classifier. To study the effectiveness and generality of our method, we tested it on a series of experiments based on both synthetic and real datasets and with gradually increasing dissimilarities. Results show that the proposed method can successfully quantify dissimilarity across the entire range of values. Next to this, we studied how dissimilarity affects CV evaluations by comparing the results of random CV and of two spatial CV methods, namely block and spatial+ CV. Our results showed that CV evaluations follow similar patterns in all datasets and predictions: when dissimilarity is low (usually lower than 30%), random CV provides the most accurate evaluation results. As dissimilarity increases, spatial CV methods, especially spatial+ CV, become more and more accurate and even outperforming random CV. When dissimilarity is high (>=90%), no CV method provides accurate evaluations. These results show the importance of considering feature space dissimilarity when working with geospatial machine learning predictions, and can help researchers and practitioners to select more suitable CV methods for evaluating their predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generalization ability of kernel interpolation in large dimensions (i.e., $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma>0$) might be one of the most interesting problems in the recent renaissance of kernel regression, since it may help us understand the 'benign overfitting phenomenon' reported in the neural networks literature. Focusing on the inner product kernel on the sphere, we fully characterized the exact order of both the variance and bias of large-dimensional kernel interpolation under various source conditions $s\geq 0$. Consequently, we obtained the $(s,\gamma)$-phase diagram of large-dimensional kernel interpolation, i.e., we determined the regions in $(s,\gamma)$-plane where the kernel interpolation is minimax optimal, sub-optimal and inconsistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwei Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies continuous-time risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation with the exponential-form objective. The risk-sensitive objective arises either as the agent's risk attitude or as a distributionally robust approach against the model uncertainty. Owing to the martingale perspective in Jia and Zhou (2023) the risk-sensitive RL problem is shown to be equivalent to ensuring the martingale property of a process involving both the value function and the q-function, augmented by an additional penalty term: the quadratic variation of the value process, capturing the variability of the value-to-go along the trajectory. This characterization allows for the straightforward adaptation of existing RL algorithms developed for non-risk-sensitive scenarios to incorporate risk sensitivity by adding the realized variance of the value process. Additionally, I highlight that the conventional policy gradient representation is inadequate for risk-sensitive problems due to the nonlinear nature of quadratic variation; however, q-learning offers a solution and extends to infinite horizon settings. Finally, I prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm for Merton's investment problem and quantify the impact of temperature parameter on the behavior of the learning procedure. I also conduct simulation experiments to demonstrate how risk-sensitive RL improves the finite-sample performance in the linear-quadratic control problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil P Ghanathe, Steve Wilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for uncertainty quantification incur massive memory and compute overhead, often requiring multiple models/inferences. Hence they are impractical on ultra-low-power KB-sized TinyML devices. To reduce overhead, prior works have proposed the use of early-exit networks as ensembles to quantify uncertainty in a single forward-pass. However, they still have a prohibitive cost for tinyML. To address these challenges, we propose QUTE, a novel resource-efficient early-exit-assisted ensemble architecture optimized for tinyML models. QUTE adds additional output blocks at the final exit of the base network and distills the knowledge of early-exits into these blocks to create a diverse and lightweight ensemble architecture. Our results show that QUTE outperforms popular prior works, and improves the quality of uncertainty estimates by 6% with 3.1x lower model size on average compared to the most relevant prior work. Furthermore, we demonstrate that QUTE is also effective in detecting co-variate shifted and out-of-distribution inputs, and shows competitive performance relative to G-ODIN, a state-of-the-art generalized OOD detector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huilin Yin, Jiaxiang Li, Pengju Zhen, Jun Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is critical for the safe planning and navigation of automated vehicles. The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method. Finally, we also demonstrate the adaptability and stealthiness of SA-Attack for different speed scenarios. Our code is available at the repository: https://github.com/eclipse-bot/SA-Attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaehyeon Lee, Jonathan Heiss, Stefan Tai, James Won-Ki Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifiable decentralized federated learning (FL) systems combining blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) make the computational integrity of local learning and global aggregation verifiable across workers. However, they are not end-to-end: data can still be corrupted prior to the learning. In this paper, we propose a verifiable decentralized FL system for end-to-end integrity and authenticity of data and computation extending verifiability to the data source. Addressing an inherent conflict of confidentiality and transparency, we introduce a two-step proving and verification (2PV) method that we apply to central system procedures: a registration workflow that enables non-disclosing verification of device certificates and a learning workflow that extends existing blockchain and ZKP-based FL systems through non-disclosing data authenticity proofs. Our evaluation on a prototypical implementation demonstrates the technical feasibility with only marginal overheads to state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Gai, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the continual learning problem of single-task offline reinforcement learning. In the past, continual reinforcement learning usually only dealt with multitasking, that is, learning multiple related or unrelated tasks in a row, but once each learned task was learned, it was not relearned, but only used in subsequent processes. However, offline reinforcement learning tasks require the continuously learning of multiple different datasets for the same task. Existing algorithms will try their best to achieve the best results in each offline dataset they have learned and the skills of the network will overwrite the high-quality datasets that have been learned after learning the subsequent poor datasets. On the other hand, if too much emphasis is placed on stability, the network will learn the subsequent better dataset after learning the poor offline dataset, and the problem of insufficient plasticity and non-learning will occur. How to design a strategy that can always preserve the best performance for each state in the data that has been learned is a new challenge and the focus of this study. Therefore, this study proposes a new algorithm, called Ensemble Offline Reinforcement Learning Based on Experience Replay, which introduces multiple value networks to learn the same dataset and judge whether the strategy has been learned by the discrete degree of the value network, to improve the performance of the network in single-task offline reinforcement learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12648">Sample-efficient Learning of Infinite-horizon Average-reward MDPs with General Function Approximation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianliang He, Han Zhong, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs) in the context of general function approximation. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithmic framework named Local-fitted Optimization with OPtimism (LOOP), which incorporates both model-based and value-based incarnations. In particular, LOOP features a novel construction of confidence sets and a low-switching policy updating scheme, which are tailored to the average-reward and function approximation setting. Moreover, for AMDPs, we propose a novel complexity measure -- average-reward generalized eluder coefficient (AGEC) -- which captures the challenge of exploration in AMDPs with general function approximation. Such a complexity measure encompasses almost all previously known tractable AMDP models, such as linear AMDPs and linear mixture AMDPs, and also includes newly identified cases such as kernel AMDPs and AMDPs with Bellman eluder dimensions. Using AGEC, we prove that LOOP achieves a sublinear $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(d, \mathrm{sp}(V^*)) \sqrt{T\beta} )$ regret, where $d$ and $\beta$ correspond to AGEC and log-covering number of the hypothesis class respectively, $\mathrm{sp}(V^*)$ is the span of the optimal state bias function, $T$ denotes the number of steps, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. When specialized to concrete AMDP models, our regret bounds are comparable to those established by the existing algorithms designed specifically for these special cases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical framework capable of handling nearly all AMDPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instead of building deep learning models from scratch, developers are more and more relying on adapting pre-trained models to their customized tasks. However, powerful pre-trained models may be misused for unethical or illegal tasks, e.g., privacy inference and unsafe content generation. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering learning paradigm, non-fine-tunable learning, which prevents the pre-trained model from being fine-tuned to indecent tasks while preserving its performance on the original task. To fulfill this goal, we propose SOPHON, a protection framework that reinforces a given pre-trained model to be resistant to being fine-tuned in pre-defined restricted domains. Nonetheless, this is challenging due to a diversity of complicated fine-tuning strategies that may be adopted by adversaries. Inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, we overcome this difficulty by designing sophisticated fine-tuning simulation and fine-tuning evaluation algorithms. In addition, we carefully design the optimization process to entrap the pre-trained model within a hard-to-escape local optimum regarding restricted domains. We have conducted extensive experiments on two deep learning modes (classification and generation), seven restricted domains, and six model architectures to verify the effectiveness of SOPHON. Experiment results verify that fine-tuning SOPHON-protected models incurs an overhead comparable to or even greater than training from scratch. Furthermore, we confirm the robustness of SOPHON to three fine-tuning methods, five optimizers, various learning rates and batch sizes. SOPHON may help boost further investigations into safe and responsible AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: We focus on the problem of Personalized Federated Continual Learning (PFCL): a group of distributed clients, each with a sequence of local tasks on arbitrary data distributions, collaborate through a central server to train a personalized model at each client, with the model expected to achieve good performance on all local tasks. We propose a novel PFCL framework called Federated Memory Strengthening FedMeS to address the challenges of client drift and catastrophic forgetting. In FedMeS, each client stores samples from previous tasks using a small amount of local memory, and leverages this information to both 1) calibrate gradient updates in training process; and 2) perform KNN-based Gaussian inference to facilitate personalization. FedMeS is designed to be task-oblivious, such that the same inference process is applied to samples from all tasks to achieve good performance. FedMeS is analyzed theoretically and evaluated experimentally. It is shown to outperform all baselines in average accuracy and forgetting rate, over various combinations of datasets, task distributions, and client numbers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temperature plays a pivotal role in moderating label softness in the realm of knowledge distillation (KD). Traditional approaches often employ a static temperature throughout the KD process, which fails to address the nuanced complexities of samples with varying levels of difficulty and overlooks the distinct capabilities of different teacher-student pairings. This leads to a less-than-ideal transfer of knowledge. To improve the process of knowledge propagation, we proposed Dynamic Temperature Knowledge Distillation (DTKD) which introduces a dynamic, cooperative temperature control for both teacher and student models simultaneously within each training iterafion. In particular, we proposed "\textbf{sharpness}" as a metric to quantify the smoothness of a model's output distribution. By minimizing the sharpness difference between the teacher and the student, we can derive sample-specific temperatures for them respectively. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-2012 demonstrate that DTKD performs comparably to leading KD techniques, with added robustness in Target Class KD and None-target Class KD scenarios.The code is available at https://github.com/JinYu1998/DTKD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate quantification of Gross Primary Production (GPP) is crucial for understanding terrestrial carbon dynamics. It represents the largest atmosphere-to-land CO$_2$ flux, especially significant for forests. Eddy Covariance (EC) measurements are widely used for ecosystem-scale GPP quantification but are globally sparse. In areas lacking local EC measurements, remote sensing (RS) data are typically utilised to estimate GPP after statistically relating them to in-situ data. Deep learning offers novel perspectives, and the potential of recurrent neural network architectures for estimating daily GPP remains underexplored. This study presents a comparative analysis of three architectures: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs). Our findings reveal comparable performance across all models for full-year and growing season predictions. Notably, LSTMs outperform in predicting climate-induced GPP extremes. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the importance of incorporating radiation and RS inputs (optical, temperature, and radar) for accurate GPP predictions, particularly during climate extremes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang He, Tianyi Zhou, Meng Fang, Setareh Maghsudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation rank is an important concept for understanding the role of Neural Networks (NNs) in Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL), which measures the expressive capacity of value networks. Existing studies focus on unboundedly maximizing this rank; nevertheless, that approach would introduce overly complex models in the learning, thus undermining performance. Hence, fine-tuning representation rank presents a challenging and crucial optimization problem. To address this issue, we find a guiding principle for adaptive control of the representation rank. We employ the Bellman equation as a theoretical foundation and derive an upper bound on the cosine similarity of consecutive state-action pairs representations of value networks. We then leverage this upper bound to propose a novel regularizer, namely BEllman Equation-based automatic rank Regularizer (BEER). This regularizer adaptively regularizes the representation rank, thus improving the DRL agent's performance. We first validate the effectiveness of automatic control of rank on illustrative experiments. Then, we scale up BEER to complex continuous control tasks by combining it with the deterministic policy gradient method. Among 12 challenging DeepMind control tasks, BEER outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Besides, BEER demonstrates significant advantages in Q-value approximation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Guo, Fanliu Kong, Xiaoyang Li, Hui Li, Wei Chen, Xiaogang Tian, Jinping Cai, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization emerges as one of the most promising compression technologies for deploying efficient large models for various real time application in recent years. Considering that the storage and IO of weights take up the vast majority of the overhead inside a large model, weight only quantization can lead to large gains. However, existing quantization schemes suffer from significant accuracy degradation at very low bits, or require some additional computational overhead when deployed, making it difficult to be applied to large-scale applications in industry. In this paper, we propose decoupleQ, achieving a substantial increase in model accuracy, especially at very low bits. decoupleQ abandons the traditional heuristic quantization paradigm and decouples the model parameters into integer and floating-point parts, thus transforming the quantization problem into a traditional mathematical optimization problem with constraints, which is then solved alternatively by off-the-shelf optimization methods.
  Quantization via decoupleQ is linear and uniform, making it hardware-friendlier than non-uniform counterpart, and enabling the idea to be migrated to high-bit quantization to enhance its robustness. Our method has achieved well on-line accuracy near fp16/bf16 on the 2-bit quantization of large speech models in ByteDance. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/decoupleQ</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhang, Youssef Mohamed, Bernard Ghanem, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, Mohamed Elhoseiny</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose and study a realistic Continual Learning (CL) setting where learning algorithms are granted a restricted computational budget per time step while training. We apply this setting to large-scale semi-supervised Continual Learning scenarios with sparse label rates. Previous proficient CL methods perform very poorly in this challenging setting. Overfitting to the sparse labeled data and insufficient computational budget are the two main culprits for such a poor performance. Our new setting encourages learning methods to effectively and efficiently utilize the unlabeled data during training. To that end, we propose a simple but highly effective baseline, DietCL, which utilizes both unlabeled and labeled data jointly. DietCL meticulously allocates computational budget for both types of data. We validate our baseline, at scale, on several datasets, e.g., CLOC, ImageNet10K, and CGLM, under constraint budget setups. DietCL outperforms, by a large margin, all existing supervised CL algorithms as well as more recent continual semi-supervised methods. Our extensive analysis and ablations demonstrate that DietCL is stable under a full spectrum of label sparsity, computational budget, and various other ablations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ata Koklu, Yusuf Guven, Tufan Kumbasar</p>
<p>Abstract: Type-1 and Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) excel in handling uncertainty alongside their parsimonious rule-based structure. Yet, in learning large-scale data challenges arise, such as the curse of dimensionality and training complexity of FLSs. The complexity is due mainly to the constraints to be satisfied as the learnable parameters define FSs and the complexity of the center of the sets calculation method, especially of IT2-FLSs. This paper explicitly focuses on the learning problem of FLSs and presents a computationally efficient learning method embedded within the realm of Deep Learning (DL). The proposed method tackles the learning challenges of FLSs by presenting computationally efficient implementations of FLSs, thereby minimizing training time while leveraging mini-batched DL optimizers and automatic differentiation provided within the DL frameworks. We illustrate the efficiency of the DL framework for FLSs on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuf Guven, Ata Koklu, Tufan Kumbasar</p>
<p>Abstract: General Type-2 (GT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) are perfect candidates to quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for informed decisions in high-risk tasks, as they are powerful tools in representing uncertainty. In this paper, we travel back in time to provide a new look at GT2-FLSs by adopting Zadeh's (Z) GT2 Fuzzy Set (FS) definition, intending to learn GT2-FLSs that are capable of achieving reliable High-Quality Prediction Intervals (HQ-PI) alongside precision. By integrating Z-GT2-FS with the \(\alpha\)-plane representation, we show that the design flexibility of GT2-FLS is increased as it takes away the dependency of the secondary membership function from the primary membership function. After detailing the construction of Z-GT2-FLSs, we provide solutions to challenges while learning from high-dimensional data: the curse of dimensionality, and integrating Deep Learning (DL) optimizers. We develop a DL framework for learning dual-focused Z-GT2-FLSs with high performances. Our study includes statistical analyses, highlighting that the Z-GT2-FLS not only exhibits high-precision performance but also produces HQ-PIs in comparison to its GT2 and IT2 fuzzy counterparts which have more learnable parameters. The results show that the Z-GT2-FLS has a huge potential in uncertainty quantification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ata Koklu, Yusuf Guven, Tufan Kumbasar</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of generating Prediction Intervals (PIs) in high-risk scenarios by proposing enhancements for learning Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) to address their learning challenges. In this context, we first provide extra design flexibility to the Karnik-Mendel (KM) and Nie-Tan (NT) center of sets calculation methods to increase their flexibility for generating PIs. These enhancements increase the flexibility of KM in the defuzzification stage while the NT in the fuzzification stage. To address the large-scale learning challenge, we transform the IT2-FLS's constraint learning problem into an unconstrained form via parameterization tricks, enabling the direct application of deep learning optimizers. To address the curse of dimensionality issue, we expand the High-Dimensional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (HTSK) method proposed for type-1 FLS to IT2-FLSs, resulting in the HTSK2 approach. Additionally, we introduce a framework to learn the enhanced IT2-FLS with a dual focus, aiming for high precision and PI generation. Through exhaustive statistical results, we reveal that HTSK2 effectively addresses the dimensionality challenge, while the enhanced KM and NT methods improved learning and enhanced uncertainty quantification performances of IT2-FLSs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marharyta Domnich, Raul Vicente</p>
<p>Abstract: A pressing issue in the adoption of AI models is the increasing demand for more human-centric explanations of their predictions. To advance towards more human-centric explanations, understanding how humans produce and select explanations has been beneficial. In this work, inspired by insights of human cognition we propose and test the incorporation of two novel biases to enhance the search for effective counterfactual explanations. Central to our methodology is the application of diffusion distance, which emphasizes data connectivity and actionability in the search for feasible counterfactual explanations. In particular, diffusion distance effectively weights more those points that are more interconnected by numerous short-length paths. This approach brings closely connected points nearer to each other, identifying a feasible path between them. We also introduce a directional coherence term that allows the expression of a preference for the alignment between the joint and marginal directional changes in feature space to reach a counterfactual. This term enables the generation of counterfactual explanations that align with a set of marginal predictions based on expectations of how the outcome of the model varies by changing one feature at a time. We evaluate our method, named Coherent Directional Counterfactual Explainer (CoDiCE), and the impact of the two novel biases against existing methods such as DiCE, FACE, Prototypes, and Growing Spheres. Through a series of ablation experiments on both synthetic and real datasets with continuous and mixed-type features, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs) with
  score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data
  generation.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality
  generative modelling method
  based on high-order
  Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching.
  This motive is proved by third-order
  Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the
  previous SDEs, e.g.
  variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs
  for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously
  model position, velocity, and
  acceleration, thereby improving the quality
  and speed of the data
  generation at the same time.
  HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
  and two Hamiltonians,
  which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude.
  Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the
  public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in
  both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood,
  and achieves the
  state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Calanzone, Stefano Teso, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a promising venue for natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, current LLMs are far from reliable: they are prone to generate non-factual information and, more crucially, to contradict themselves when prompted to reason about beliefs of the world. These problems are currently addressed with large scale fine-tuning or by delegating consistent reasoning to external tools. In this work, we strive for a middle ground and introduce a training objective based on principled probabilistic reasoning that teaches a LLM to be consistent with external knowledge in the form of a set of facts and rules. Fine-tuning with our loss on a limited set of facts enables our LLMs to be more logically consistent than previous baselines and allows them to extrapolate to unseen but semantically similar factual knowledge more systematically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeke Xia, Ming Hu, Dengke Yan, Ruixuan Liu, Anran Li, Xiaofei Xie, Mingsong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Split Federated Learning (SFL) is good at enabling knowledge sharing among resource-constrained clients, it suffers from the problem of low training accuracy due to the neglect of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose a novel SFL approach named KoReA-SFL, which adopts a multi-model aggregation mechanism to alleviate gradient divergence caused by heterogeneous data and a knowledge replay strategy to deal with catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, in KoReA-SFL cloud servers (i.e., fed server and main server) maintain multiple branch model portions rather than a global portion for local training and an aggregated master-model portion for knowledge sharing among branch portions. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, the main server of KoReA-SFL selects multiple assistant devices for knowledge replay according to the training data distribution of each server-side branch-model portion. Experimental results obtained from non-IID and IID scenarios demonstrate that KoReA-SFL significantly outperforms conventional SFL methods (by up to 23.25\% test accuracy improvement).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeke Xia, Ming Hu, Dengke Yan, Xiaofei Xie, Tianlin Li, Anran Li, Junlong Zhou, Mingsong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm has been widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications. However, the efficiency and inference capability of FL is seriously limited due to the presence of stragglers and data imbalance across massive AIoT devices, respectively. To address the above challenges, we present a novel asynchronous FL approach named CaBaFL, which includes a hierarchical Cache-based aggregation mechanism and a feature Balance-guided device selection strategy. CaBaFL maintains multiple intermediate models simultaneously for local training. The hierarchical cache-based aggregation mechanism enables each intermediate model to be trained on multiple devices to align the training time and mitigate the straggler issue. In specific, each intermediate model is stored in a low-level cache for local training and when it is trained by sufficient local devices, it will be stored in a high-level cache for aggregation. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the feature balance-guided device selection strategy in CaBaFL adopts the activation distribution as a metric, which enables each intermediate model to be trained across devices with totally balanced data distributions before aggregation. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art FL methods, CaBaFL achieves up to 9.26X training acceleration and 19.71\% accuracy improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Pio Ricciardi, Valentino Maiorca, Luca Moschella, Riccardo Marin, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning is a popular and powerful framework that takes full advantage of the Deep Learning breakthrough. However, it is also known that variations in the input (e.g., different colors of the panorama due to the season of the year) or the task (e.g., changing the speed limit for a car to respect) could require complete retraining of the agents. In this work, we leverage recent developments in unifying latent representations to demonstrate that it is possible to combine the components of an agent, rather than retrain it from scratch. We build upon the recent relative representations framework and adapt it for Visual RL. This allows us to create completely new agents capable of handling environment-task combinations never seen during training. Our work paves the road toward a more accessible and flexible use of reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has emerged as a fundamental concept in the study of wide Neural Networks. In particular, it is known that the positivity of the NTK is directly related to the memorization capacity of sufficiently wide networks, i.e., to the possibility of reaching zero loss in training, via gradient descent. Here we will improve on previous works and obtain a sharp result concerning the positivity of the NTK of feedforward networks of any depth. More precisely, we will show that, for any non-polynomial activation function, the NTK is strictly positive definite. Our results are based on a novel characterization of polynomial functions which is of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data assimilation is a core component of numerical weather prediction systems. The large quantity of data processed during assimilation requires the computation to be distributed across increasingly many compute nodes, yet existing approaches suffer from synchronisation overhead in this setting. In this paper, we exploit the formulation of data assimilation as a Bayesian inference problem and apply a message-passing algorithm to solve the spatial inference problem. Since message passing is inherently based on local computations, this approach lends itself to parallel and distributed computation. In combination with a GPU-accelerated implementation, we can scale the algorithm to very large grid sizes while retaining good accuracy and compute and memory requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration efficiency poses a significant challenge in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) tasks, particularly those with long horizons and sparse rewards. A primary limitation to exploration efficiency is the agent's inability to leverage environmental structural patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, GEASD, designed to capture these patterns through an adaptive skill distribution during the learning process. This distribution optimizes the local entropy of achieved goals within a contextual horizon, enhancing goal-spreading behaviors and facilitating deep exploration in states containing familiar structural patterns. Our experiments reveal marked improvements in exploration efficiency using the adaptive skill distribution compared to a uniform skill distribution. Additionally, the learned skill distribution demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, achieving substantial exploration progress in unseen tasks containing similar local structures.</p>

The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, especially for systems with non-Gaussian statistics, often encountered in dynamical systems far from equilibrium. Such cases often present limitations for conventional approximate methods. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from a stochastic partial differential equation where the score function is available analytically. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our methodology over conventional methods and its potential as a versatile tool for understanding complex dynamical systems.

<p>Abstract: This study explored the application of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry and soil image analysis to rapidly assess soil fertility, focusing on critical parameters such as available B, organic carbon (OC), available Mn, available S, and the sulfur availability index (SAI). Analyzing 1,133 soil samples from various agro-climatic zones in Eastern India, the research combined color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results indicated that integrating image features (IFs) with auxiliary variables (AVs) significantly enhanced prediction accuracy for available B (R^2 = 0.80) and OC (R^2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further improved predictions for available Mn and SAI with R^2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study demonstrated how these integrated technologies have the potential to provide quick and affordable options for soil testing, opening up access to more sophisticated prediction models and a better comprehension of the fertility and health of the soil. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset of soil images, developed using soils from a broader range of agro-climatic zones under field condition.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised domain adaptation method aimed at autonomously generating image masks outlining regions of interest (ROIs) for differentiating breast lesions in breast ultrasound (US) imaging. Our semi-supervised learning approach utilizes a primitive model trained on a small public breast US dataset with true annotations. This model is then iteratively refined for the domain adaptation task, generating pseudo-masks for our private, unannotated breast US dataset. The dataset, twice the size of the public one, exhibits considerable variability in image acquisition perspectives and demographic representation, posing a domain-shift challenge. Unlike typical domain adversarial training, we employ downstream classification outcomes as a benchmark to guide the updating of pseudo-masks in subsequent iterations. We found the classification precision to be highly correlated with the completeness of the generated ROIs, which promotes the explainability of the deep learning classification model. Preliminary findings demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of this approach in streamlining the ROI annotation process, thereby enhancing the classification and localization of breast lesions for more precise and interpretable diagnoses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks by integrating the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and external knowledge databases. However, RAG introduces long sequence generation and leads to high computation and memory costs. We propose Thoth, a novel multilevel dynamic caching system tailored for RAG. Our analysis benchmarks current RAG systems, pinpointing the performance bottleneck (i.e., long sequence due to knowledge injection) and optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states). Based on these insights, we design Thoth, which organizes the intermediate states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU and host memory hierarchy. Thoth proposes a replacement policy that is aware of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the end-to-end latency. We implement Thoth and evaluate it on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector database. The experimental results show that Thoth reduces the time to first token (TTFT) by up to 4x and improves the throughput by up to 2.1x compared to vLLM integrated with Faiss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Sun, Matias Mendieta, Aritra Dutta, Xin Li, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal transformers mark significant progress in different domains, but siloed high-quality data hinders their further improvement. To remedy this, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for training models without direct access to the raw data held by different clients. Despite its potential, a considerable research direction regarding the unpaired uni-modal clients and the transformer architecture in FL remains unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper explores a transfer multi-modal federated learning (MFL) scenario within the vision-language domain, where clients possess data of various modalities distributed across different datasets. We systematically evaluate the performance of existing methods when a transformer architecture is utilized and introduce a novel framework called Federated modality complementary and collaboration (FedCola) by addressing the in-modality and cross-modality gaps among clients. Through extensive experiments across various FL settings, FedCola demonstrates superior performance over previous approaches, offering new perspectives on future federated training of multi-modal transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gargi Roy, Dalia Chakrabarty</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new strategy for learning the functional relation between a pair of variables, while addressing inhomogeneities in the correlation structure of the available data, by modelling the sought function as a sample function of a non-stationary Gaussian Process (GP), that nests within itself multiple other GPs, each of which we prove can be stationary, thereby establishing sufficiency of two GP layers. In fact, a non-stationary kernel is envisaged, with each hyperparameter set as dependent on the sample function drawn from the outer non-stationary GP, such that a new sample function is drawn at every pair of input values at which the kernel is computed. However, such a model cannot be implemented, and we substitute this by recalling that the average effect of drawing different sample functions from a given GP is equivalent to that of drawing a sample function from each of a set of GPs that are rendered different, as updated during the equilibrium stage of the undertaken inference (via MCMC). The kernel is fully non-parametric, and it suffices to learn one hyperparameter per layer of GP, for each dimension of the input variable. We illustrate this new learning strategy on a real dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Li, Subhabrata Sen, Ben Adlam</p>
<p>Abstract: In the transfer learning paradigm models learn useful representations (or features) during a data-rich pretraining stage, and then use the pretrained representation to improve model performance on data-scarce downstream tasks. In this work, we explore transfer learning with the goal of optimizing downstream performance. We introduce a simple linear model that takes as input an arbitrary pretrained feature transform. We derive exact asymptotics of the downstream risk and its fine-grained bias-variance decomposition. Our finding suggests that using the ground-truth featurization can result in "double-divergence" of the asymptotic risk, indicating that it is not necessarily optimal for downstream performance. We then identify the optimal pretrained representation by minimizing the asymptotic downstream risk averaged over an ensemble of downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals the relative importance of learning the task-relevant features and structures in the data covariates and characterizes how each contributes to controlling the downstream risk from a bias-variance perspective. Moreover, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon where the optimal pretrained representation transitions from hard to soft selection of relevant features and discuss its connection to principal component regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Matthew Sainsbury-Dale, Rapha\"el Huser</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation-based methods for making statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimisation libraries, and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortised, in the sense that they allow inference to be made quickly through fast feedforward operations. In this article we review recent progress made in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, the automatic construction of summary statistics, and likelihood approximation. The review also covers available software, and includes a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortised inference and the benefits they offer over state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyros Angelopoulos, Marcin Bienkowski, Christoph D\"urr, Bertrand Simon</p>
<p>Abstract: Contract scheduling is a widely studied framework for designing real-time systems with interruptible capabilities. Previous work has showed that a prediction on the interruption time can help improve the performance of contract-based systems, however it has relied on a single prediction that is provided by a deterministic oracle. In this work, we introduce and study more general and realistic learning-augmented settings in which the prediction is in the form of a probability distribution, or it is given as a set of multiple possible interruption times. For both prediction settings, we design and analyze schedules which perform optimally if the prediction is accurate, while simultaneously guaranteeing the best worst-case performance if the prediction is adversarial. We also provide evidence that the resulting system is robust to prediction errors in the distributional setting. Last, we present an experimental evaluation that confirms the theoretical findings, and illustrates the performance improvements that can be attained in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihan Tu, Li-Yi Wei, Matthias Zwicker</p>
<p>Abstract: Texture plays a vital role in enhancing visual richness in both real photographs and computer-generated imagery. However, the process of editing textures often involves laborious and repetitive manual adjustments of textons, which are the small, recurring local patterns that define textures. In this work, we introduce a fully unsupervised approach for representing textures using a compositional neural model that captures individual textons. We represent each texton as a 2D Gaussian function whose spatial support approximates its shape, and an associated feature that encodes its detailed appearance. By modeling a texture as a discrete composition of Gaussian textons, the representation offers both expressiveness and ease of editing. Textures can be edited by modifying the compositional Gaussians within the latent space, and new textures can be efficiently synthesized by feeding the modified Gaussians through a generator network in a feed-forward manner. This approach enables a wide range of applications, including transferring appearance from an image texture to another image, diversifying textures, texture interpolation, revealing/modifying texture variations, edit propagation, texture animation, and direct texton manipulation. The proposed approach contributes to advancing texture analysis, modeling, and editing techniques, and opens up new possibilities for creating visually appealing images with controllable textures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Gao, Maryam Haghifam, Christina Giannoula, Renbo Tu, Gennady Pekhimenko, Nandita Vijaykumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have revolutionized numerous domains, yet optimizing them for computational efficiency remains a challenging endeavor. Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing.
  This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manipulation of elastoplastic objects like dough often involves topological changes such as splitting and merging. The ability to accurately predict these topological changes that a specific action might incur is critical for planning interactions with elastoplastic objects. We present DoughNet, a Transformer-based architecture for handling these challenges, consisting of two components. First, a denoising autoencoder represents deformable objects of varying topology as sets of latent codes. Second, a visual predictive model performs autoregressive set prediction to determine long-horizon geometrical deformation and topological changes purely in latent space. Given a partial initial state and desired manipulation trajectories, it infers all resulting object geometries and topologies at each step. DoughNet thereby allows to plan robotic manipulation; selecting a suited tool, its pose and opening width to recreate robot- or human-made goals. Our experiments in simulated and real environments show that DoughNet is able to significantly outperform related approaches that consider deformation only as geometrical change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyang Song, Kaiyu Yang, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Theorem proving is an important challenge for large language models (LLMs), as formal proofs can be checked rigorously by proof assistants such as Lean, leaving no room for hallucination. Existing LLM-based provers try to prove theorems in a fully autonomous mode without human intervention. In this mode, they struggle with novel and challenging theorems, for which human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a framework for running LLM inference in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Using Lean Copilot, we build tools for suggesting proof steps (tactic suggestion), completing intermediate proof goals (proof search), and selecting relevant premises (premise selection) using LLMs. Users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in assisting humans and automating theorem proving process compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean. We open source all codes under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junrui Zhang, Mozhgan Pourkeshavarz, Amir Rasouli</p>
<p>Abstract: As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations situated in tables from scientific articles. This dataset is designed to facilitate human-AI collaborative problem-solving through AI-powered multi-task tabular capabilities. In contrast to prior work that models interactions as factoid QA or procedure synthesis, iTBLS broadens the scope of interactions to include mathematical reasoning, natural language manipulation, and expansion of existing tables from natural language conversation by delineating interactions into one of three tasks: interpretation, modification, or generation. Additionally, the paper presents a suite of baseline approaches to iTBLS, utilizing zero-shot prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for different computing situations. We also introduce a novel multi-step approach and show how it can be leveraged in conjunction with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve the state-of-the-art on iTBLS; outperforming standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning by up to 15% on interpretation, 18% on modification, and 38% on generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating probability density functions based on sample data, using a finite mixture of densities from some component class. To this end, we introduce the $h$-lifted Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as a generalization of the standard KL divergence and a criterion for conducting risk minimization. Under a compact support assumption, we prove an $\mc{O}(1/{\sqrt{n}})$ bound on the expected estimation error when using the $h$-lifted KL divergence, which extends the results of Rakhlin et al. (2005, ESAIM: Probability and Statistics, Vol. 9) and Li and Barron (1999, Advances in Neural Information ProcessingSystems, Vol. 12) to permit the risk bounding of density functions that are not strictly positive. We develop a procedure for the computation of the corresponding maximum $h$-lifted likelihood estimators ($h$-MLLEs) using the Majorization-Maximization framework and provide experimental results in support of our theoretical bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Yang, Zuchao Li, Shuai Xie, Weiping Zhu, Wei Yu, Shijun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer learning has achieved exciting results in vision-language models. Traditional adapter methods often require training or fine-tuning, facing challenges such as insufficient samples or resource limitations. While some methods overcome the need for training by leveraging image modality cache and retrieval, they overlook the text modality's importance and cross-modal cues for the efficient adaptation of parameters in visual-language models. This work introduces a cross-modal parameter-efficient approach named XMAdapter. XMAdapter establishes cache models for both text and image modalities. It then leverages retrieval through visual-language bimodal information to gather clues for inference. By dynamically adjusting the affinity ratio, it achieves cross-modal fusion, decoupling different modal similarities to assess their respective contributions. Additionally, it explores hard samples based on differences in cross-modal affinity and enhances model performance through adaptive adjustment of sample learning intensity. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that XMAdapter outperforms previous adapter-based methods significantly regarding accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the flourishing development of intelligent warehousing systems, the technology of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) has experienced rapid growth. Within intelligent warehousing environments, AGV is required to safely and rapidly plan an optimal path in complex and dynamic environments. Most research has studied deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. However, in the environments with sparse extrinsic rewards, these algorithms often converge slowly, learn inefficiently or fail to reach the target. Random Network Distillation (RND), as an exploration enhancement, can effectively improve the performance of proximal policy optimization, especially enhancing the additional intrinsic rewards of the AGV agent which is in sparse reward environments. Moreover, most of the current research continues to use 2D grid mazes as experimental environments. These environments have insufficient complexity and limited action sets. To solve this limitation, we present simulation environments of AGV path planning with continuous actions and positions for AGVs, so that it can be close to realistic physical scenarios. Based on our experiments and comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, the results demonstrate that our proposed method enables AGV to more rapidly complete path planning tasks with continuous actions in our environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lasal Jayawardena, Prasan Yapa</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past year, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has experienced an exponential surge, largely due to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have exhibited the most effective performance in a range of domains within the Natural Language Processing and Generation domains. However, their application in domain-specific tasks, such as paraphrasing, presents significant challenges. The extensive number of parameters makes them difficult to operate on commercial hardware, and they require substantial time for inference, leading to high costs in a production setting. In this study, we tackle these obstacles by employing LLMs to develop three distinct models for the paraphrasing field, applying a method referred to as sequence-level knowledge distillation. These distilled models are capable of maintaining the quality of paraphrases generated by the LLM. They demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate diverse paraphrases of comparable quality. A notable characteristic of these models is their ability to exhibit syntactic diversity while also preserving lexical diversity, features previously uncommon due to existing data quality issues in datasets and not typically observed in neural-based approaches. Human evaluation of our models shows that there is only a 4% drop in performance compared to the LLM teacher model used in the distillation process, despite being 1000 times smaller. This research provides a significant contribution to the NLG field, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for paraphrasing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) has played a crucial role in preserving the security of face recognition technology. With the rise of counterfeit face generation techniques, the challenge posed by digitally edited faces to face anti-spoofing is escalating. Existing FAS technologies primarily focus on intercepting physically forged faces and lack a robust solution for cross-domain FAS challenges. Moreover, determining an appropriate threshold to achieve optimal deployment results remains an issue for intra-domain FAS. To address these issues, we propose a visualization method that intuitively reflects the training outcomes of models by visualizing the prediction results on datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that employing data augmentation techniques, such as downsampling and Gaussian blur, can effectively enhance performance on cross-domain tasks. Building upon our data visualization approach, we also introduce a methodology for setting threshold values based on the distribution of the training dataset. Ultimately, our methods secured us second place in both the Unified Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection competition and the Snapshot Spectral Imaging Face Anti-spoofing contest.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Liu, Hai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Naively assuming English as a source language may hinder cross-lingual transfer for many languages by failing to consider the importance of language contact. Some languages are more well-connected than others, and target languages can benefit from transferring from closely related languages; for many languages, the set of closely related languages does not include English. In this work, we study the impact of source language for cross-lingual transfer, demonstrating the importance of selecting source languages that have high contact with the target language. We also construct a novel benchmark dataset for close contact Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese (CJKV) languages to further encourage in-depth studies of language contact. To comprehensively capture contact between these languages, we propose to integrate Romanized transcription beyond textual scripts via Contrastive Learning objectives, leading to enhanced cross-lingual representations and effective zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.</p>

The results show that the performance of single-modal text classification is significantly better than single-modal image classification, but the effect of multi-modal combination is better than any single modality.

Unfortunately, existing detection methods suffer from poor generalization performance, because their training process usually relies on the examples generated from a single known adversarial attack and there exists a large discrepancy between the training and unseen testing adversarial examples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, named Adversarial Example Detection via Principal Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AED-PADA). Specifically, our approach identifies the Principal Adversarial Domains (PADs), i.e., a combination of features of the adversarial examples from different attacks, which possesses large coverage of the entire adversarial feature space. Then, we pioneer to exploit multi-source domain adaptation in adversarial example detection with PADs as source domains. Experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our proposed AED-PADA. Note that this superiority is particularly achieved in challenging scenarios characterized by employing the minimal magnitude constraint for the perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Man M. Ho, Shikha Dubey, Yosep Chong, Beatrice Knudsen, Tolga Tasdizen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Frozen Section (FS) technique is a rapid and efficient method, taking only 15-30 minutes to prepare slides for pathologists' evaluation during surgery, enabling immediate decisions on further surgical interventions. However, FS process often introduces artifacts and distortions like folds and ice-crystal effects. In contrast, these artifacts and distortions are absent in the higher-quality formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides, which require 2-3 days to prepare. While Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods have been used to translate FS to FFPE images (F2F), they may leave morphological inaccuracies with remaining FS artifacts or introduce new artifacts, reducing the quality of these translations for clinical assessments. In this study, we benchmark recent generative models, focusing on GANs and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), to overcome these limitations. We introduce a novel approach that combines LDMs with Histopathology Pre-Trained Embeddings to enhance restoration of FS images. Our framework leverages LDMs conditioned by both text and pre-trained embeddings to learn meaningful features of FS and FFPE histopathology images. Through diffusion and denoising techniques, our approach not only preserves essential diagnostic attributes like color staining and tissue morphology but also proposes an embedding translation mechanism to better predict the targeted FFPE representation of input FS images. As a result, this work achieves a significant improvement in classification performance, with the Area Under the Curve rising from 81.99% to 94.64%, accompanied by an advantageous CaseFD. This work establishes a new benchmark for FS to FFPE image translation quality, promising enhanced reliability and accuracy in histopathology FS image analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zang, Tian Yun, Hao Tan, Trung Bui, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a "durian" learn visual concepts such as "brown" (color) and "spiky" (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned "for free" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. "spiky" as opposed to "spiky durian"), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georges Le Bellier (CEDRIC - VERTIGO, CNAM), Nicolas Audebert (CEDRIC - VERTIGO, CNAM, IGN)</p>
<p>Abstract: Earth Observation imagery can capture rare and unusual events, such as disasters and major landscape changes, whose visual appearance contrasts with the usual observations. Deep models trained on common remote sensing data will output drastically different features for these out-of-distribution samples, compared to those closer to their training dataset. Detecting them could therefore help anticipate changes in the observations, either geographical or environmental. In this work, we show that the reconstruction error of diffusion models can effectively serve as unsupervised out-of-distribution detectors for remote sensing images, using them as a plausibility score. Moreover, we introduce ODEED, a novel reconstruction-based scorer using the probability-flow ODE of diffusion models. We validate it experimentally on SpaceNet 8 with various scenarios, such as classical OOD detection with geographical shift and near-OOD setups: pre/post-flood and non-flooded/flooded image recognition. We show that our ODEED scorer significantly outperforms other diffusion-based and discriminative baselines on the more challenging near-OOD scenarios of flood image detection, where OOD images are close to the distribution tail. We aim to pave the way towards better use of generative models for anomaly detection in remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyi Lin, Ning Sun, Pallab Bhattacharya, Xizhou Feng, Louis Feng, John D. Owens</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing and predicting the training performance of modern machine learning (ML) workloads on compute systems with compute and communication spread between CPUs, GPUs, and network devices is not only the key to optimization and planning but also a complex goal to achieve. The primary challenges include the complexity of synchronization and load balancing between CPUs and GPUs, the variance in input data distribution, and the use of different communication devices and topologies (e.g., NVLink, PCIe, network cards) that connect multiple compute devices, coupled with the desire for flexible training configurations. Built on top of our prior work for single-GPU platforms, we address these challenges and enable multi-GPU performance modeling by incorporating (1) data-distribution-aware performance models for embedding table lookup, and (2) data movement prediction of communication collectives, into our upgraded performance modeling pipeline equipped with inter-and intra-rank synchronization for ML workloads trained on multi-GPU platforms. Beyond accurately predicting the per-iteration training time of DLRM models with random configurations with a geomean error of 5.21% on two multi-GPU platforms, our prediction pipeline generalizes well to other types of ML workloads, such as Transformer-based NLP models with a geomean error of 3.00%. Moreover, even without actually running ML workloads like DLRMs on the hardware, it is capable of generating insights such as quickly selecting the fastest embedding table sharding configuration (with a success rate of 85%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Hong, Yinfei Li, Xiaojun Qiao, Rui Li, Junsong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective representations for Chinese characters presents unique challenges, primarily due to the vast number of characters and their continuous growth, which requires models to handle an expanding category space. Additionally, the inherent sparsity of character usage complicates the generalization of learned representations. Prior research has explored radical-based sequences to overcome these issues, achieving progress in recognizing unseen characters. However, these approaches fail to fully exploit the inherent tree structure of such sequences. To address these limitations and leverage established data properties, we propose Formation Tree-CLIP (FT-CLIP). This model utilizes formation trees to represent characters and incorporates a dedicated tree encoder, significantly improving performance in both seen and unseen character recognition tasks. We further introduce masking for to both character images and tree nodes, enabling efficient and effective training. This approach accelerates training significantly (by a factor of 2 or more) while enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments show that processing characters through formation trees aligns better with their inherent properties than direct sequential methods, significantly enhancing the generality and usability of the representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo D'Amicantonio, Egor Bondarau, Peter H. N. de With</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have achieved significant improvements on public video anomaly datasets, but often do not perform well in real-world applications. This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12718">Improving Prediction Accuracy of Semantic Segmentation Methods Using Convolutional Autoencoder Based Pre-processing Layers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hisashi Shimodaira</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to improve prediction accuracy of semantic segmentation methods as follows: (1) construct a neural network that has pre-processing layers based on a convolutional autoencoder ahead of a semantic segmentation network, and (2) train the entire network initialized by the weights of the pre-trained autoencoder. We applied this method to the fully convolutional network (FCN) and experimentally compared its prediction accuracy on the cityscapes dataset. The Mean IoU of the proposed target model with the He normal initialization is 18.7% higher than that of FCN with the He normal initialization. In addition, those of the modified models of the target model are significantly higher than that of FCN with the He normal initialization. The accuracy and loss curves during the training showed that these are resulting from the improvement of the generalization ability. All of these results provide strong evidence that the proposed method is significantly effective in improving the prediction accuracy of FCN. The proposed method has the following features: it is comparatively simple, whereas the effect on improving the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of FCN is significant; the increase in the number of parameters by using it is very small, and that in the computation time is substantially large. In principle, the proposed method can be applied to other semantic segmentation methods. For semantic segmentation, at present, there is no effective way to improve the prediction accuracy of existing methods. None have published a method which is the same as or similar to our method and none have used such a method in practice. Therefore, we believe that our method is useful in practice and worthy of being widely known and used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohong Li, Fangxiao Lu, Jiaqi Zou, Lei Hu, Hongyan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Land-cover mapping is one of the vital applications in Earth observation, aiming at classifying each pixel's land-cover type of remote-sensing images. As natural and human activities change the landscape, the land-cover map needs to be rapidly updated. However, discovering newly appeared land-cover types in existing classification systems is still a non-trivial task hindered by various scales of complex land objects and insufficient labeled data over a wide-span geographic area. In this paper, we propose a generalized few-shot segmentation-based framework, named SegLand, to update novel classes in high-resolution land-cover mapping. Specifically, the proposed framework is designed in three parts: (a) Data pre-processing: the base training set and the few-shot support sets of novel classes are analyzed and augmented; (b) Hybrid segmentation structure; Multiple base learners and a modified Projection onto Orthogonal Prototypes (POP) network are combined to enhance the base-class recognition and to dig novel classes from insufficient labels data; (c) Ultimate fusion: the semantic segmentation results of the base learners and POP network are reasonably fused. The proposed framework has won first place in the leaderboard of the OpenEarthMap Land Cover Mapping Few-Shot Challenge. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the framework for automatically updating novel land-cover classes with limited labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxi Mu, Xinyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of visual cues has revitalized the performance of the target speech extraction task, elevating it to the forefront of the field. Nevertheless, this multi-modal learning paradigm often encounters the challenge of modality imbalance. In audio-visual target speech extraction tasks, the audio modality tends to dominate, potentially overshadowing the importance of visual guidance. To tackle this issue, we propose AVSepChain, drawing inspiration from the speech chain concept. Our approach partitions the audio-visual target speech extraction task into two stages: speech perception and speech production. In the speech perception stage, audio serves as the dominant modality, while visual information acts as the conditional modality. Conversely, in the speech production stage, the roles are reversed. This transformation of modality status aims to alleviate the problem of modality imbalance. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive semantic matching loss to ensure that the semantic information conveyed by the generated speech aligns with the semantic information conveyed by lip movements during the speech production stage. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets for audio-visual target speech extraction, we showcase the superior performance achieved by our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) exhibit significant potential in supervised learning model training by virtue of their ability to generate realistic labeled images. However, numerous studies have indicated the privacy leakage risk in CGANs models. The solution DPCGAN, incorporating the differential privacy framework, faces challenges such as heavy reliance on labeled data for model training and potential disruptions to original gradient information due to excessive gradient clipping, making it difficult to ensure model accuracy. To address these challenges, we present a privacy-preserving training framework called PATE-TripleGAN. This framework incorporates a classifier to pre-classify unlabeled data, establishing a three-party min-max game to reduce dependence on labeled data. Furthermore, we present a hybrid gradient desensitization algorithm based on the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and Differential Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) method. This algorithm allows the model to retain gradient information more effectively while ensuring privacy protection, thereby enhancing the model's utility. Privacy analysis and extensive experiments affirm that the PATE-TripleGAN model can generate a higher quality labeled image dataset while ensuring the privacy of the training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based ego-lane inference using High-Definition (HD) maps is essential in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. The traditional approach necessitates well-calibrated cameras, which confines variation of camera configuration, as the algorithm relies on intrinsic and extrinsic calibration.

To enhance robust performance, our model incorporates the two-head structure inferring ego-lane in two perspectives simultaneously. Furthermore, we utilize an attention mechanism guided by vanishing point-and-line to adapt to changes in viewpoint without requiring accurate calibration. The high adaptability of our model was validated in diverse environments, devices, and camera mounting points and orientations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Contrastive Gaussian Clustering, a novel approach capable of provide segmentation masks from any viewpoint and of enabling 3D segmentation of the scene. Recent works in novel-view synthesis have shown how to model the appearance of a scene via a cloud of 3D Gaussians, and how to generate accurate images from a given viewpoint by projecting on it the Gaussians before $\alpha$ blending their color. Following this example, we train a model to include also a segmentation feature vector for each Gaussian. These can then be used for 3D scene segmentation, by clustering Gaussians according to their feature vectors; and to generate 2D segmentation masks, by projecting the Gaussians on a plane and $\alpha$ blending over their segmentation features. Using a combination of contrastive learning and spatial regularization, our method can be trained on inconsistent 2D segmentation masks, and still learn to generate segmentation masks consistent across all views. Moreover, the resulting model is extremely accurate, improving the IoU accuracy of the predicted masks by $+8\%$ over the state of the art. Code and trained models will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-centric visual question answering (VQA) has made great strides with the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet open-source models still fall short of leading models like GPT4V and Gemini, partly due to a lack of extensive, high-quality instruction tuning data. To this end, we introduce a new approach for creating a massive, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset, Square-10M, which is generated using closed-source MLLMs. The data construction process, termed Square, consists of four steps: Self-Questioning, Answering, Reasoning, and Evaluation. Our experiments with Square-10M led to three key findings: 1) Our model, TextSquare, considerably surpasses open-source previous state-of-the-art Text-centric MLLMs and sets a new standard on OCRBench(62.2%). It even outperforms top-tier models like GPT4V and Gemini in 6 of 10 text-centric benchmarks. 2) Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of VQA reasoning data in offering comprehensive contextual insights for specific questions. This not only improves accuracy but also significantly mitigates hallucinations. Specifically, TextSquare scores an average of 75.1% across four general VQA and hallucination evaluation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. 3) Notably, the phenomenon observed in scaling text-centric VQA datasets reveals a vivid pattern: the exponential increase of instruction tuning data volume is directly proportional to the improvement in model performance, thereby validating the necessity of the dataset scale and the high quality of Square-10M.</p>

<p>Abstract: The sim-to-real gap poses a significant challenge in RL-based multi-agent exploration due to scene quantization and action discretization. Existing platforms suffer from the inefficiency in sampling and the lack of diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms across different scenarios, restraining their widespread applications.

Moreover, we employ point clouds to represent our exploration scenarios, leading to high-fidelity environment mapping and a sampling speed approximately 40 times faster than existing platforms. Furthermore, equipped with an attention-based Multi-Agent Target Generator and a Single-Agent Motion Planner, MAexp can work with arbitrary numbers of agents and accommodate various types of robots. Extensive experiments are conducted to establish the first benchmark featuring several high-performance MARL algorithms across typical scenarios for robots with continuous actions, which highlights the distinct strengths of each algorithm in different scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmytro Shvetsov, Joonas Ariva, Marharyta Domnich, Raul Vicente, Dmytro Fishman</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images, including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations. The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al. This evidence suggests that COIN is a promising approach for semantic segmentation of tumors in CT images, and presents a step forward in making deep learning applications more accessible and effective in healthcare, where annotated data is scarce.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have significantly contributed to various computer vision tasks, including object recognition and object detection. Their open vocabulary feature enhances their value. However, their black-box nature and lack of explainability in predictions make them less trustworthy in critical domains. Recently, some work has been done to force VLMs to provide reasonable rationales for object recognition, but this often comes at the expense of classification accuracy. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical definition of explainability in the object recognition task based on the joint probability distribution of categories and rationales, then leverage this definition to fine-tune CLIP in an explainable manner. Through evaluations of different datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in explainable classification. Notably, it excels in zero-shot settings, showcasing its adaptability. This advancement improves explainable object recognition, enhancing trust across diverse applications. The code will be made available online upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Among the existing backdoor defense methods, trigger reverse engineering based approaches, which reconstruct the backdoor triggers via optimizations, are the most versatile and effective ones compared to other types of methods. In this paper, we summarize and construct a generic paradigm for the typical trigger reverse engineering process. Based on this paradigm, we propose a new perspective to defeat trigger reverse engineering by manipulating the classification confidence of backdoor samples. To determine the specific modifications of classification confidence, we propose a compensatory model to compute the lower bound of the modification. With proper modifications, the backdoor attack can easily bypass the trigger reverse engineering based methods. To achieve this objective, we propose a Label Smoothing Poisoning (LSP) framework, which leverages label smoothing to specifically manipulate the classification confidences of backdoor samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed work can defeat the state-of-the-art trigger reverse engineering based methods, and possess good compatibility with a variety of existing backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ross Greer, Bj{\o}rk Antoniussen, Andreas M{\o}gelmose, Mohan Trivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection is crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, data-driven approaches face challenges when encountering minority or novel objects in the 3D driving scene. In this paper, we propose VisLED, a language-driven active learning framework for diverse open-set 3D Object Detection. Our method leverages active learning techniques to query diverse and informative data samples from an unlabeled pool, enhancing the model's ability to detect underrepresented or novel objects. Specifically, we introduce the Vision-Language Embedding Diversity Querying (VisLED-Querying) algorithm, which operates in both open-world exploring and closed-world mining settings. In open-world exploring, VisLED-Querying selects data points most novel relative to existing data, while in closed-world mining, it mines new instances of known classes. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to random sampling and entropy-querying methods. Our results show that VisLED-Querying consistently outperforms random sampling and offers competitive performance compared to entropy-querying despite the latter's model-optimality, highlighting the potential of VisLED for improving object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fiona Katharina Ewald, Ludwig Bothmann, Marvin N. Wright, Bernd Bischl, Giuseppe Casalicchio, Gunnar K\"onig</p>
<p>Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide, due to their opaque internal mechanisms. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions. Since the results of different FI methods have different interpretations, selecting the correct FI method for a concrete use case is crucial and still requires expert knowledge. This paper serves as a comprehensive guide to help understand the different interpretations of FI methods. Through an extensive review of FI methods and providing new proofs regarding their interpretation, we facilitate a thorough understanding of these methods and formulate concrete recommendations for scientific inference. We conclude by discussing options for FI uncertainty estimation and point to directions for future research aiming at full statistical inference from black-box ML models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shentong Mo, Xufang Luo, Yansen Wang, Dongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual task adaptation has been demonstrated to be effective in adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to general downstream visual tasks using specialized learnable layers or tokens. However, there is yet a large-scale benchmark to fully explore the effect of visual task adaptation on the realistic and important medical domain, particularly across diverse medical visual modalities, such as color images, X-ray, and CT. To close this gap, we present Med-VTAB, a large-scale Medical Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark consisting of 1.68 million medical images for diverse organs, modalities, and adaptation approaches. Based on Med-VTAB, we explore the scaling law of medical prompt tuning concerning tunable parameters and the generalizability of medical visual adaptation using non-medical/medical pre-train weights. Besides, we study the impact of patient ID out-of-distribution on medical visual adaptation, which is a real and challenging scenario. Furthermore, results from Med-VTAB indicate that a single pre-trained model falls short in medical task adaptation. Therefore, we introduce GMoE-Adapter, a novel method that combines medical and general pre-training weights through a gated mixture-of-experts adapter, achieving state-of-the-art results in medical visual task adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Ling, Bo Han, Yongkang Wongkan, Han Lin, Mohan Kankanhalli, Weidong Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional human motion synthesis (HMS) aims to generate human motion sequences that conform to specific conditions. Text and audio represent the two predominant modalities employed as HMS control conditions. While existing research has primarily focused on single conditions, the multi-condition human motion synthesis remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a multi-condition HMS framework, termed MCM, based on a dual-branch structure composed of a main branch and a control branch. This framework effectively extends the applicability of the diffusion model, which is initially predicated solely on textual conditions, to auditory conditions. This extension encompasses both music-to-dance and co-speech HMS while preserving the intrinsic quality of motion and the capabilities for semantic association inherent in the original model. Furthermore, we propose the implementation of a Transformer-based diffusion model, designated as MWNet, as the main branch. This model adeptly apprehends the spatial intricacies and inter-joint correlations inherent in motion sequences, facilitated by the integration of multi-wise self-attention modules. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive results in single-condition and multi-condition HMS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiang Zhuang, Baoping Cheng, Yao Cheng, Yuntao Jin, Renshuai Liu, Chengyang Li, Xuan Cheng, Jing Liao, Juncong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech-driven facial animation methods usually contain two main classes, 3D and 2D talking face, both of which attract considerable research attention in recent years. However, to the best of our knowledge, the research on 3D talking face does not go deeper as 2D talking face, in the aspect of lip-synchronization (lip-sync) and speech perception. To mind the gap between the two sub-fields, we propose a learning framework named Learn2Talk, which can construct a better 3D talking face network by exploiting two expertise points from the field of 2D talking face. Firstly, inspired by the audio-video sync network, a 3D sync-lip expert model is devised for the pursuit of lip-sync between audio and 3D facial motion. Secondly, a teacher model selected from 2D talking face methods is used to guide the training of the audio-to-3D motions regression network to yield more 3D vertex accuracy. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of lip-sync, vertex accuracy and speech perception, compared with state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of the proposed framework: audio-visual speech recognition and speech-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting based avatar animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asmar Muqeet, Shaukat Ali, Tao Yue, Paolo Arcaini</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers for some complex computational problems. However, current quantum computers (e.g., from IBM and Google) have inherent noise that results in errors in the outputs of quantum software executing on the quantum computers, affecting the reliability of quantum software development. The industry is increasingly interested in machine learning (ML)--based error mitigation techniques, given their scalability and practicality. However, existing ML-based techniques have limitations, such as only targeting specific noise types or specific quantum circuits. This paper proposes a practical ML-based approach, called Q-LEAR, with a novel feature set, to mitigate noise errors in quantum software outputs. We evaluated Q-LEAR on eight quantum computers and their corresponding noisy simulators, all from IBM, and compared Q-LEAR with a state-of-the-art ML-based approach taken as baseline. Results show that, compared to the baseline, Q-LEAR achieved a 25% average improvement in error mitigation on both real quantum computers and simulators. We also discuss the implications and practicality of Q-LEAR, which, we believe, is valuable for practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris N. Slautin, Yongtao Liu, Hiroshi Funakubo, Rama K. Vasudevan, Maxim A. Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific advancement is universally based on the dynamic interplay between theoretical insights, modelling, and experimental discoveries. However, this feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or theory in the loop automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is not only to use theory but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian co-navigation of theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces. This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While demonstrated here within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our approach holds promise for broader applications, the exploration of optical properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex materials, and properties of molecular systems.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized image generation, producing high-quality images with applications spanning various fields. However, their ability to create hyper-realistic images poses significant challenges in distinguishing between real and synthetic content, raising concerns about digital authenticity and potential misuse in creating deepfakes. This work introduces a robust detection framework that integrates image and text features extracted by CLIP model with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. We propose a novel loss that can improve the detector's robustness and handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we flatten the loss landscape during the model training to improve the detector's generalization capabilities. The effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional detection techniques, is demonstrated through extensive experiments, underscoring its potential to set a new state-of-the-art approach in DM-generated image detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Vilouras, Pedro Sanchez, Alison Q. O'Neil, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing the exact pathological regions in a given medical scan is an important imaging problem that requires a large amount of bounding box ground truth annotations to be accurately solved. However, there exist alternative, potentially weaker, forms of supervision, such as accompanying free-text reports, which are readily available. The task of performing localization with textual guidance is commonly referred to as phrase grounding. In this work, we use a publicly available Foundation Model, namely the Latent Diffusion Model, to solve this challenging task. This choice is supported by the fact that the Latent Diffusion Model, despite being generative in nature, contains mechanisms (cross-attention) that implicitly align visual and textual features, thus leading to intermediate representations that are suitable for the task at hand. In addition, we aim to perform this task in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any further training on target data, meaning that the model's weights remain frozen. To this end, we devise strategies to select features and also refine them via post-processing without extra learnable parameters. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches which explicitly enforce image-text alignment in a joint embedding space via contrastive learning. Results on a popular chest X-ray benchmark indicate that our method is competitive wih SOTA on different types of pathology, and even outperforms them on average in terms of two metrics (mean IoU and AUC-ROC). Source code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacopo Bonato, Marco Cotogni, Luigi Sabetta</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Selective-distillation for Class and Architecture-agnostic unleaRning (SCAR), a novel approximate unlearning method. SCAR efficiently eliminates specific information while preserving the model's test accuracy without using a retain set, which is a key component in state-of-the-art approximate unlearning algorithms. Our approach utilizes a modified Mahalanobis distance to guide the unlearning of the feature vectors of the instances to be forgotten, aligning them to the nearest wrong class distribution. Moreover, we propose a distillation-trick mechanism that distills the knowledge of the original model into the unlearning model with out-of-distribution images for retaining the original model's test performance without using any retain set. Importantly, we propose a self-forget version of SCAR that unlearns without having access to the forget set. We experimentally verified the effectiveness of our method, on three public datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art methods. Our method obtains performance higher than methods that operate without the retain set and comparable w.r.t the best methods that rely on the retain set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joe D. Longbottom, Max D. Champneys, Timothy J. Rogers</p>
<p>Abstract: In engineering, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamic systems from data contaminated by noise is both essential and complex. Established Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, used for the Bayesian identification of these systems, facilitate the quantification of uncertainty in the parameter identification process. A significant challenge in this context is the numerical integration of continuous-time ordinary differential equations (ODEs), crucial for aligning theoretical models with discretely sampled data. This integration introduces additional numerical uncertainty, a factor that is often over looked. To address this issue, the field of probabilistic numerics combines numerical methods, such as numerical integration, with probabilistic modeling to offer a more comprehensive analysis of total uncertainty. By retaining the accuracy of classical deterministic methods, these probabilistic approaches offer a deeper understanding of the uncertainty inherent in the inference process. This paper demonstrates the application of a probabilistic numerical method for solving ODEs in the joint parameter-state identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The presented approach efficiently identifies latent states and system parameters from noisy measurements. Simultaneously incorporating probabilistic solutions to the ODE in the identification challenge. The methodology's primary advantage lies in its capability to produce posterior distributions over system parameters, thereby representing the inherent uncertainties in both the data and the identification process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigory Bartosh, Dmitry Vetrov, Christian A. Naesseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the fixed linear Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories. This exploration underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function that defines the discrepancy between the predicted model output and the target value. The selection of the loss function is crucial to achieve task-specific behaviour and highly influences the capability of the model. A variety of loss functions have been proposed for a wide range of tasks affecting training and model performance. For classification tasks, the cross entropy is the de-facto standard and usually the first choice. Here, we try to experimentally challenge the well-known loss functions, including cross entropy (CE) loss, by utilizing the genetic programming (GP) approach, a population-based evolutionary algorithm. GP constructs loss functions from a set of operators and leaf nodes and these functions are repeatedly recombined and mutated to find an optimal structure. Experiments were carried out on different small-sized datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Fashion-MNIST using an Inception model. The 5 best functions found were evaluated for different model architectures on a set of standard datasets ranging from 2 to 102 classes and very different sizes. One function, denoted as Next Generation Loss (NGL), clearly stood out showing same or better performance for all tested datasets compared to CE. To evaluate the NGL function on a large-scale dataset, we tested its performance on the Imagenet-1k dataset where it showed improved top-1 accuracy compared to models trained with identical settings and other losses. Finally, the NGL was trained on a segmentation downstream task for Pascal VOC 2012 and COCO-Stuff164k datasets improving the underlying model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an approach for estimating the latent knowledge embedded inside large language models (LLMs). We leverage the in-context learning (ICL) abilities of LLMs to estimate the extent to which an LLM knows the facts stored in a knowledge base. Our knowledge estimator avoids reliability concerns with previous prompting-based methods, is both conceptually simpler and easier to apply, and we demonstrate that it can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also investigate how different design choices affect the performance of ICL-based knowledge estimation. Using the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the factual knowledge of a variety of open source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2), Mistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata knowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between different model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are consistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise facts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their finetuned counterparts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the advancement of deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for pneumonia from adult chest x-ray (CXR) images, the performance of CAD methods applied to pediatric images remains suboptimal, mainly due to the lack of large-scale annotated pediatric imaging datasets. Establishing a proper framework to leverage existing adult large-scale CXR datasets can thus enhance pediatric pneumonia detection performance. In this paper, we propose a three-branch parallel path learning-based framework that utilizes both adult and pediatric datasets to improve the performance of deep learning models on pediatric test datasets. The paths are trained with pediatric only, adult only, and both types of CXRs, respectively. Our proposed framework utilizes the multi-positive contrastive loss to cluster the classwise embeddings and the embedding similarity loss among these three parallel paths to make the classwise embeddings as close as possible to reduce the effect of domain shift. Experimental evaluations on open-access adult and pediatric CXR datasets show that the proposed method achieves a superior AUROC score of 0.8464 compared to 0.8348 obtained using the conventional approach of join training on both datasets. The proposed approach thus paves the way for generalized CAD models that are effective for both adult and pediatric age groups.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</p>

Later, we utilize clean speech spectrograms and their corresponding deep representations as reference signals to refine the spectrogram distortion and representation shift of enhanced speech during model training. Experimental results validate that the proposed TRNet substantially increases the system's robustness in both matched and unmatched noisy environments, without compromising its performance in clean environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transforming two-dimensional (2D) images into three-dimensional (3D) volumes is a well-known yet challenging problem for the computer vision community. In the medical domain, a few previous studies attempted to convert two or more input radiographs into computed tomography (CT) volumes. Following their effort, we introduce a diffusion model-based technology that can rotate the anatomical content of any input radiograph in 3D space, potentially enabling the visualization of the entire anatomical content of the radiograph from any viewpoint in 3D. Similar to previous studies, we used CT volumes to create Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) as the training data for our model. However, we addressed two significant limitations encountered in previous studies: 1. We utilized conditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance instead of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve higher mode coverage and improved output image quality, with the only trade-off being slower inference time, which is often less critical in medical applications; and 2. We demonstrated that the unreliable output of style transfer deep learning (DL) models, such as Cycle-GAN, to transfer the style of actual radiographs to DRRs could be replaced with a simple yet effective training transformation that randomly changes the pixel intensity histograms of the input and ground-truth imaging data during training. This transformation makes the diffusion model agnostic to any distribution variations of the input data pixel intensity, enabling the reliable training of a DL model on input DRRs and applying the exact same model to conventional radiographs (or DRRs) during inference.</p>

Traditional approaches often fail to quantify uncertainty and lack clarity in model decision-making, which complicates acceptance. In this article, we describe how conformal prediction can be employed to quantify uncertainty and add robustness in scrap classification. We have adapted the Split Conformal Prediction technique to seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art computer vision models, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and ResNet-50, while also incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods. We evaluate the approach using a comprehensive dataset of 8147 images spanning nine ferrous scrap classes. The application of the Split Conformal Prediction method allowed for the quantification of each model's uncertainties, which enhanced the understanding of predictions and increased the reliability of the results. Specifically, the Swin Transformer model demonstrated more reliable outcomes than the others, as evidenced by its smaller average size of prediction sets and achieving an average classification accuracy exceeding 95%. Furthermore, the Score-CAM method proved highly effective in clarifying visual features, significantly enhancing the explainability of the classification decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuofan Ma, Yi Jiang, Jiannan Wu, Zehuan Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Groma, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with grounded and fine-grained visual perception ability. Beyond holistic image understanding, Groma is adept at region-level tasks such as region captioning and visual grounding. Such capabilities are built upon a localized visual tokenization mechanism, where an image input is decomposed into regions of interest and subsequently encoded into region tokens. By integrating region tokens into user instructions and model responses, we seamlessly enable Groma to understand user-specified region inputs and ground its textual output to images. Besides, to enhance the grounded chat ability of Groma, we curate a visually grounded instruction dataset by leveraging the powerful GPT-4V and visual prompting techniques. Compared with MLLMs that rely on the language model or external module for localization, Groma consistently demonstrates superior performances in standard referring and grounding benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of embedding localization into image tokenization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchi Liu, Lei Wang, Yuli Zou, James Zou, Liang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification, a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is around 0.4), which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and mean square error loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Yauney, David Mimno</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the in-context learning classification performance of language models poses challenges due to small dataset sizes, extensive prompt-selection using the validation set, and intentionally difficult tasks that lead to near-random performance. The standard random baseline -- the expected accuracy of guessing labels uniformly at random -- is stable when the evaluation set is used only once or when the dataset is large. We account for the common practice of validation set reuse and existing small datasets with a stronger random baseline: the expected maximum accuracy across multiple random classifiers. When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized language models applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20\% of the few-shot results that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger random baseline. When held-out test sets are available, this stronger baseline is also a better predictor of held-out performance than the standard baseline, avoiding unnecessary test set evaluations. This maximum random baseline provides an easily calculated drop-in replacement for the standard baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Nicolas Dufour, Nefeli Andreou, Marie-Paule Cani, Victoria Fernandez Abrevaya, David Picard, Vicky Kalogeiton</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) enhances the quality and condition adherence of text-to-image diffusion models. It operates by combining the conditional and unconditional predictions using a fixed weight. However, recent works vary the weights throughout the diffusion process, reporting superior results but without providing any rationale or analysis. By conducting comprehensive experiments, this paper provides insights into CFG weight schedulers. Our findings suggest that simple, monotonically increasing weight schedulers consistently lead to improved performances, requiring merely a single line of code. In addition, more complex parametrized schedulers can be optimized for further improvement, but do not generalize across different models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Gadgil, Mahtab Bigverdi</p>
<p>Abstract: AI in dermatology is evolving at a rapid pace but the major limitation to training trustworthy classifiers is the scarcity of data with ground-truth concept level labels, which are meta-labels semantically meaningful to humans. Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Air pollution is one of the leading causes of mortality globally, resulting in millions of deaths each year. Efficient monitoring is important to measure exposure and enforce legal limits. New low-cost sensors can be deployed in greater numbers and in more varied locations, motivating the problem of efficient automated placement. Previous work suggests Bayesian optimisation is an appropriate method, but only considered a satellite data set, with data aggregated over all altitudes. It is ground-level pollution, that humans breathe, which matters most. We improve on those results using hierarchical models and evaluate our models on urban pollution data in London to show that Bayesian optimisation can be successfully applied to the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstandinos Kotsiopoulos, Alexey Miroshnikov, Khashayar Filom, Arjun Ravi Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, many Machine Learning (ML) explanation techniques have been designed using ideas from cooperative game theory. These game-theoretic explainers suffer from high complexity, hindering their exact computation in practical settings. In our work, we focus on a wide class of linear game values, as well as coalitional values, for the marginal game based on a given ML model and predictor vector. By viewing these explainers as expectations over appropriate sample spaces, we design a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm that estimates them at a reduced complexity that depends linearly on the size of the background dataset. We set up a rigorous framework for the statistical analysis and obtain error bounds for our sampling methods. The advantage of this approach is that it is fast, easily implementable, and model-agnostic. Furthermore, it has similar statistical accuracy as other known estimation techniques that are more complex and model-specific. We provide rigorous proofs of statistical convergence, as well as numerical experiments whose results agree with our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward A. Small, Kacper Sokol, Daniel Manning, Flora D. Salim, Jeffrey Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Group fairness is achieved by equalising prediction distributions between protected sub-populations; individual fairness requires treating similar individuals alike. These two objectives, however, are incompatible when a scoring model is calibrated through discontinuous probability functions, where individuals can be randomly assigned an outcome determined by a fixed probability. This procedure may provide two similar individuals from the same protected group with classification odds that are disparately different -- a clear violation of individual fairness. Assigning unique odds to each protected sub-population may also prevent members of one sub-population from ever receiving equal chances of a positive outcome to another, which we argue is another type of unfairness called individual odds. We reconcile all this by constructing continuous probability functions between group thresholds that are constrained by their Lipschitz constant. Our solution preserves the model's predictive power, individual fairness and robustness while ensuring group fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing threat of antibiotic resistance necessitates accurate differentiation between bacterial and viral infections for proper antibiotic administration. In this study, a Virus vs. Bacteria machine learning model was developed to distinguish between these infection types using 16 routine blood test results, C-reactive protein concentration (CRP), biological sex, and age. With a dataset of 44,120 cases from a single medical center, the model achieved an accuracy of 82.2 %, a sensitivity of 79.7 %, a specificity of 84.5 %, a Brier score of 0.129, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.905, outperforming a CRP-based decision rule. Notably, the machine learning model enhanced accuracy within the CRP range of 10-40 mg/L, a range where CRP alone is less informative. These results highlight the advantage of integrating multiple blood parameters in diagnostics. The "Virus vs. Bacteria" model paves the way for advanced diagnostic tools, leveraging machine learning to optimize infection management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Ju, Dongyue Li, Hongyang R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider minimizing a perturbed function $F(W) = \mathbb{E}_{U}[f(W + U)]$, given a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and a random sample $U$ from a distribution $\mathcal{P}$ with mean zero. When $\mathcal{P}$ is the isotropic Gaussian, $F(W)$ is roughly equal to $f(W)$ plus a penalty on the trace of $\nabla^2 f(W)$, scaled by the variance of $\mathcal{P}$. This penalty on the Hessian has the benefit of improving generalization, through PAC-Bayes analysis. It is useful in low-sample regimes, for instance, when a (large) pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a small data set. One way to minimize $F$ is by adding $U$ to $W$, and then run SGD. We observe, empirically, that this noise injection does not provide significant gains over SGD, in our experiments of conducting fine-tuning on three image classification data sets. We design a simple, practical algorithm that adds noise along both $U$ and $-U$, with the option of adding several perturbations and taking their average. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm, showing tight rates on the norm of the output's gradient.
  We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, by first showing that in an over-parameterized matrix sensing problem, it can find solutions with lower test loss than naive noise injection. Then, we compare our algorithm with four sharpness-reducing training methods (such as the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (Foret et al., 2021)). We find that our algorithm can outperform them by up to 1.8% test accuracy, for fine-tuning ResNet on six image classification data sets. It leads to a 17.7% (and 12.8%) reduction in the trace (and largest eigenvalue) of the Hessian matrix of the loss surface. This form of regularization on the Hessian is compatible with $\ell_2$ weight decay (and data augmentation), in the sense that combining both can lead to improved empirical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Bellinger, Mark Crowley, Isaac Tamblyn</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to learn sophisticated control policies for complex tasks including games, robotics, heating and cooling systems and text generation. The action-perception cycle in RL, however, generally assumes that a measurement of the state of the environment is available at each time step without a cost. In applications such as materials design, deep-sea and planetary robot exploration and medicine, however, there can be a high cost associated with measuring, or even approximating, the state of the environment. In this paper, we survey the recently growing literature that adopts the perspective that an RL agent might not need, or even want, a costly measurement at each time step. Within this context, we propose the Deep Dynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA), contrast it with the literature and empirically evaluate it on OpenAI gym and Atari Pong environments. Our results, show that DMSOA learns a better policy with fewer decision steps and measurements than the considered alternative from the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Liu, Ellen L. Zippi, Hadi Pouransari, Chris Sandino, Jingping Nie, Hanlin Goh, Erdrin Azemi, Ali Moin</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from biosignals is vital for building a comprehensive representation of people's physical and mental states. However, multimodal biosignals often exhibit substantial distributional shifts between pretraining and inference datasets, stemming from changes in task specification or variations in modality compositions. To achieve effective pretraining in the presence of potential distributional shifts, we propose a frequency-aware masked autoencoder ($\texttt{bio}$FAME) that learns to parameterize the representation of biosignals in the frequency space. $\texttt{bio}$FAME incorporates a frequency-aware transformer, which leverages a fixed-size Fourier-based operator for global token mixing, independent of the length and sampling rate of inputs. To maintain the frequency components within each input channel, we further employ a frequency-maintain pretraining strategy that performs masked autoencoding in the latent space. The resulting architecture effectively utilizes multimodal information during pretraining, and can be seamlessly adapted to diverse tasks and modalities at test time, regardless of input size and order. We evaluated our approach on a diverse set of transfer experiments on unimodal time series, achieving an average of $\uparrow$5.5% improvement in classification accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our architecture is robust in modality mismatch scenarios, including unpredicted modality dropout or substitution, proving its practical utility in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Yan, Raihan Seraj, Jiawei He, Lili Meng, Tristan Sylvain</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine-based prediction of real-world events is garnering attention due to its potential for informed decision-making. Whereas traditional forecasting predominantly hinges on structured data like time-series, recent breakthroughs in language models enable predictions using unstructured text. In particular, (Zou et al., 2022) unveils AutoCast, a new benchmark that employs news articles for answering forecasting queries. Nevertheless, existing methods still trail behind human performance. The cornerstone of accurate forecasting, we argue, lies in identifying a concise, yet rich subset of news snippets from a vast corpus. With this motivation, we introduce AutoCast++, a zero-shot ranking-based context retrieval system, tailored to sift through expansive news document collections for event forecasting. Our approach first re-ranks articles based on zero-shot question-passage relevance, honing in on semantically pertinent news. Following this, the chosen articles are subjected to zero-shot summarization to attain succinct context. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, we conduct both the relevance evaluation and article summarization without needing domain-specific training. Notably, recent articles can sometimes be at odds with preceding ones due to new facts or unanticipated incidents, leading to fluctuating temporal dynamics. To tackle this, our re-ranking mechanism gives preference to more recent articles, and we further regularize the multi-passage representation learning to align with human forecaster responses made on different dates. Empirical results underscore marked improvements across multiple metrics, improving the performance for multiple-choice questions (MCQ) by 48% and true/false (TF) questions by up to 8%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhang Chen, Bo Liu, Kaizhao Liang, Qiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.
  This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) + \kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep time-series forecasting plays an integral role in numerous practical applications. However, existing research fall short by focusing narrowly on either neural architecture designs for long-term point forecasts or probabilistic models for short-term scenarios. By proposing a comprehensive framework, facilitated by a novel tool, ProbTS, that integrates diverse data scenarios, evaluation metrics, and methodological focuses, we aim to transcend the limitations of current forecasting practices. Rigorous experimentation uncovers pivotal insights, including the supreme importance of aligning forecasting methodologies with the unique characteristics of the data; the necessity of a broad spectrum of metrics for accurately assessing both point and distributional forecasts; and the challenges inherent in adapting existing forecasting methods to a wider range of scenarios. These findings not only challenge conventional approaches but also illuminate promising avenues for future research, suggesting a more nuanced and effective strategy for advancing the field of deep time-series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyao Guo, Sulaiman A. Alghunaim, Kun Yuan, Laurent Condat, Jinde Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The ProxSkip algorithm for decentralized and federated learning is gaining increasing attention due to its proven benefits in accelerating communication complexity while maintaining robustness against data heterogeneity. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and do not achieve linear speedup, where convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of nodes. So far, questions remain open about how ProxSkip behaves in the non-convex setting and whether linear speedup is achievable.
  In this paper, we revisit decentralized ProxSkip and address both questions. We demonstrate that the leading communication complexity of ProxSkip is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2}\right)$ for non-convex and convex settings, and $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon}\right)$ for the strongly convex setting, where $n$ represents the number of nodes, $p$ denotes the probability of communication, $\sigma^2$ signifies the level of stochastic noise, and $\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy level. This result illustrates that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup and can asymptotically reduce communication overhead proportional to the probability of communication. Additionally, for the strongly convex setting, we further prove that ProxSkip can achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Armacki, Pranay Sharma, Gauri Joshi, Dragana Bajovic, Dusan Jakovetic, Soummya Kar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study high-probability convergence guarantees of learning on streaming data in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. In the proposed scenario, the model is updated in an online fashion, as new information is observed, without storing any additional data. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, we consider a general framework of nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD), providing several strong results. First, for non-convex costs and component-wise nonlinearities, we establish a convergence rate arbitrarily close to $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\frac{1}{4}}\right)$, whose exponent is independent of noise and problem parameters. Second, for strongly convex costs and a broader class of nonlinearities, we establish convergence of the last iterate to the optimum, with a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\zeta} \right)$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on problem parameters, noise and nonlinearity. As we show analytically and numerically, $\zeta$ can be used to inform the preferred choice of nonlinearity for given problem settings. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping, require bounded noise moments of order $\eta \in (1,2]$, and establish convergence rates whose exponents go to zero as $\eta \rightarrow 1$, we provide high-probability guarantees for a much broader class of nonlinearities and symmetric density noise, with convergence rates whose exponents are bounded away from zero, even when the noise has finite first moment only. Moreover, in the case of strongly convex functions, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of our general framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alok Tripathy, Katherine Yelick, Aydin Buluc</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compact and computationally efficient way to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. GNN models are frequently large, making distributed minibatch training necessary.
  The primary contribution of this paper is new methods for reducing communication in the sampling step for distributed GNN training. Here, we propose a matrix-based bulk sampling approach that expresses sampling as a sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) and samples multiple minibatches at once. When the input graph topology does not fit on a single device, our method distributes the graph and use communication-avoiding SpGEMM algorithms to scale GNN minibatch sampling, enabling GNN training on much larger graphs than those that can fit into a single device memory. When the input graph topology (but not the embeddings) fits in the memory of one GPU, our approach (1) performs sampling without communication, (2) amortizes the overheads of sampling a minibatch, and (3) can represent multiple sampling algorithms by simply using different matrix constructions. In addition to new methods for sampling, we introduce a pipeline that uses our matrix-based bulk sampling approach to provide end-to-end training results. We provide experimental results on the largest Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets on $128$ GPUs, and show that our pipeline is $2.5\times$ faster than Quiver (a distributed extension to PyTorch-Geometric) on a $3$-layer GraphSAGE network. On datasets outside of OGB, we show a $8.46\times$ speedup on $128$ GPUs in per-epoch time. Finally, we show scaling when the graph is distributed across GPUs and scaling for both node-wise and layer-wise sampling algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sigrid Passano Hellan, Christopher G. Lucas, Nigel H. Goddard</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning for Bayesian optimisation has generally assumed a strong similarity between optimisation tasks, with at least a subset having similar optimal inputs. This assumption can reduce computational costs, but it is violated in a wide range of optimisation problems where transfer learning may nonetheless be useful. We replace this assumption with a weaker one only requiring the shape of the optimisation landscape to be similar, and analyse the recent method Prior Learning for Bayesian Optimisation - PLeBO - in this setting. By learning priors for the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process surrogate model we can better approximate the underlying function, especially for few function evaluations. We validate the learned priors and compare to a breadth of transfer learning approaches, using synthetic data and a recent air pollution optimisation problem as benchmarks. We show that PLeBO and prior transfer find good inputs in fewer evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyuan Wang, Jiacong Mi, Shan Lu, Jieyue He</p>
<p>Abstract: The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liping Yi, Han Yu, Zhuan Shi, Gang Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Lizhen Cui, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving collaboratively machine learning paradigm. Traditional FL requires all data owners (a.k.a. FL clients) to train the same local model. This design is not well-suited for scenarios involving data and/or system heterogeneity. Model-Heterogeneous Personalized FL (MHPFL) has emerged to address this challenge. Existing MHPFL approaches often rely on a public dataset with the same nature as the learning task, or incur high computation and communication costs. To address these limitations, we propose the Federated Semantic Similarity Aggregation (FedSSA) approach for supervised classification tasks, which splits each client's model into a heterogeneous (structure-different) feature extractor and a homogeneous (structure-same) classification header. It performs local-to-global knowledge transfer via semantic similarity-based header parameter aggregation. In addition, global-to-local knowledge transfer is achieved via an adaptive parameter stabilization strategy which fuses the seen-class parameters of historical local headers with that of the latest global header for each client. FedSSA does not rely on public datasets, while only requiring partial header parameter transmission to save costs. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of FedSSA. Extensive experiments present that FedSSA achieves up to 3.62% higher accuracy, 15.54 times higher communication efficiency, and 15.52 times higher computational efficiency compared to 7 state-of-the-art MHPFL baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyewon Jeong, Nassim Oufattole, Matthew Mcdermott, Aparna Balagopalan, Bryan Jangeesingh, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Collin Stultz</p>
<p>Abstract: In clinical practice, one often needs to identify whether a patient is at high risk of adverse outcomes after some key medical event. For example, quantifying the risk of adverse outcomes after an acute cardiovascular event helps healthcare providers identify those patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes; i.e., patients who benefit from invasive therapies that can lower their risk. Assessing the risk of adverse outcomes, however, is challenging due to the complexity, variability, and heterogeneity of longitudinal medical data, especially for individuals suffering from chronic diseases like heart failure. In this paper, we introduce Event-Based Contrastive Learning (EBCL) - a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events. We demonstrate that EBCL can be used to construct models that yield improved performance on important downstream tasks relative to other pretraining methods. We develop and test the method using a cohort of heart failure patients obtained from a large hospital network and the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset consisting of patients in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care center. On both cohorts, EBCL pretraining yields models that are performant with respect to a number of downstream tasks, including mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay. In addition, unsupervised EBCL embeddings effectively cluster heart failure patients into subgroups with distinct outcomes, thereby providing information that helps identify new heart failure phenotypes. The contrastive framework around the index event can be adapted to a wide array of time-series datasets and provides information that can be used to guide personalized care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzhou Lou, Junge Zhang, Ziyan Wang, Kaiqi Huang, Yali Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) agents accomplish given tasks while adhering to specific constraints. Employing constraints expressed via easily-understandable human language offers considerable potential for real-world applications due to its accessibility and non-reliance on domain expertise. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically adopt a recurrent neural network, which leads to limited capabilities when dealing with various forms of human language input. Furthermore, these methods often require a ground-truth cost function, necessitating domain expertise for the conversion of language constraints into a well-defined cost function that determines constraint violation. To address these issues, we proposes to use pre-trained language models (LM) to facilitate RL agents' comprehension of natural language constraints and allow them to infer costs for safe policy learning. Through the use of pre-trained LMs and the elimination of the need for a ground-truth cost, our method enhances safe policy learning under a diverse set of human-derived free-form natural language constraints. Experiments on grid-world navigation and robot control show that the proposed method can achieve strong performance while adhering to given constraints. The usage of pre-trained LMs allows our method to comprehend complicated constraints and learn safe policies without the need for ground-truth cost at any stage of training or evaluation. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of each part of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Zhang, Xinke Jiang, Yuchen Fang, Jiayuan Luo, Yongxin Xu, Yichen Zhu, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown considerable effectiveness in a variety of graph learning tasks, particularly those based on the message-passing approach in recent years. However, their performance is often constrained by a limited receptive field, a challenge that becomes more acute in the presence of sparse graphs. In light of the power series, which possesses infinite expansion capabilities, we propose a novel Graph Power Filter Neural Network (GPFN) that enhances node classification by employing a power series graph filter to augment the receptive field. Concretely, our GPFN designs a new way to build a graph filter with an infinite receptive field based on the convergence power series, which can be analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains. Besides, we theoretically prove that our GPFN is a general framework that can integrate any power series and capture long-range dependencies. Finally, experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GPFN over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqiang Guo, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Yanrui Du, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block, molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor. Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines, validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular representation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Po-Chen Lin, Christopher Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model parameters. In this work, we propose \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{F}ederated Learning with \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{D}ifferential \underline{P}rivacy ({\tt H$^2$FDP}), a DP-enhanced FL methodology for jointly optimizing privacy and performance in hierarchical networks. Building upon recent proposals for Hierarchical Differential Privacy (HDP), one of the key concepts of {\tt H$^2$FDP} is adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy -- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior of {\tt H$^2$FDP}, revealing conditions on parameter tuning under which the training process converges sublinearly to a finite stationarity gap that depends on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target privacy level.
  Leveraging these relationships, we develop an adaptive control algorithm for {\tt H$^2$FDP} that tunes properties of local model training to minimize communication energy, latency, and the stationarity gap while striving to maintain a sub-linear convergence rate and meet desired privacy criteria.
  Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that {\tt H$^2$FDP} obtains substantial improvements in these metrics over baselines for different privacy budgets, and validate the impact of different system configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Koller, Tobias Ladner, Matthias Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., small input perturbations can significantly affect the outputs of a neural network. In safety-critical environments, the inputs often contain noisy sensor data; hence, in this case, neural networks that are robust against input perturbations are required. To ensure safety, the robustness of a neural network must be formally verified. However, training and formally verifying robust neural networks is challenging. We address both of these challenges by employing, for the first time, an end-to-end set-based training procedure that trains robust neural networks for formal verification. Our training procedure trains neural networks, which can be easily verified using simple polynomial-time verification algorithms. Moreover, our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our set-based training procedure effectively trains robust neural networks, which are easier to verify. Set-based trained neural networks consistently match or outperform those trained with state-of-the-art robust training approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghua Ling, Lin Ouyang, Boufeniza Redouane Larbi, Jing-Jia Luo, Tao Han, Xiaohui Zhong, Lei Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models and indicating the emergence of profound potential tools for atmosphere-ocean forecasts. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities, proposes the "Three Large Rules" to measure their development. We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis is anticipated to offer a more advanced and reliable approach for improved atmosphere-ocean forecasts. Additionally, we illustrate how forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model through an example by building a large artificial intelligence model for global ocean wave forecast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Xu, Joscha C\"uppers, Jilles Vreeken</p>
<p>Abstract: SHAP is a popular approach to explain black-box models by revealing the importance of individual features. As it ignores feature interactions, SHAP explanations can be confusing up to misleading. NSHAP, on the other hand, reports the additive importance for all subsets of features. While this does include all interacting sets of features, it also leads to an exponentially sized, difficult to interpret explanation. In this paper, we propose to combine the best of these two worlds, by partitioning the features into parts that significantly interact, and use these parts to compose a succinct, interpretable, additive explanation. We derive a criterion by which to measure the representativeness of such a partition for a models behavior, traded off against the complexity of the resulting explanation. To efficiently find the best partition out of super-exponentially many, we show how to prune sub-optimal solutions using a statistical test, which not only improves runtime but also helps to detect spurious interactions. Experiments on synthetic and real world data show that our explanations are both more accurate resp. more easily interpretable than those of SHAP and NSHAP.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Jia, Hang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 CPU cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Sonoda, Isao Ishikawa, Masahiro Ikeda</p>
<p>Abstract: To investigate neural network parameters, it is easier to study the distribution of parameters than to study the parameters in each neuron. The ridgelet transform is a pseudo-inverse operator that maps a given function $f$ to the parameter distribution $\gamma$ so that a network $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]$ reproduces $f$, i.e. $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]=f$. For depth-2 fully-connected networks on a Euclidean space, the ridgelet transform has been discovered up to the closed-form expression, thus we could describe how the parameters are distributed. However, for a variety of modern neural network architectures, the closed-form expression has not been known. In this paper, we explain a systematic method using Fourier expressions to derive ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern networks such as networks on finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, fully-connected networks on noncompact symmetric spaces $G/K$, and pooling layers, or the $d$-plane ridgelet transform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xu, Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Shitao Tang, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Fengwei An, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various tasks, such as text summarization, text question-answering, and etc. While their performance is impressive, the computational footprint due to their vast number of parameters can be prohibitive. Existing solutions such as SparseGPT and Wanda attempt to alleviate this issue through weight pruning. However, their layer-wise approach results in significant perturbation to the model's output and requires meticulous hyperparameter tuning, such as the pruning rate, which can adversely affect overall model performance. To address this, this paper introduces a novel LLM pruning technique dubbed blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation (BESA) by applying a blockwise reconstruction loss. In contrast to the typical layer-wise pruning techniques, BESA is characterized by two distinctive attributes: i) it targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, and ii) it allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, both of which ensure reduced performance degradation after pruning. Our experiments show that BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently pruning LLMs like LLaMA1, and LLaMA2 with 7B to 70B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just five hours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiago H Silva, Daniel Silver</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep representations have shown promising performance when transferred to downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/non_neg.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the suitability of Russet potato clones for advancement in breeding trials. Leveraging data from manually collected trials in the state of Oregon, we investigate the potential of a wide variety of state-of-the-art binary classification models.

The top-performing models, namely the multi-layer perceptron classifier (MLPC), histogram-based gradient boosting classifier (HGBC), and a support vector machine classifier (SVC), demonstrate consistent and significant results. Variable selection further enhances model performance and identifies influential features in predicting trial outcomes. The findings emphasize the potential of machine learning in streamlining the selection process for potato varieties, offering benefits such as increased efficiency, substantial cost savings, and judicious resource utilization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cangqing Wang, Yutian Yang, Ruisi Li, Dan Sun, Ruicong Cai, Yuzhu Zhang, Chengqian Fu, Lillian Floyd</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inaugurated a transformative epoch in natural language processing, fostering unprecedented proficiency in text generation, comprehension, and contextual scrutiny. Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models' context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs' efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Zhao, Haixia Han, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, they may still generate incorrect responses in certain scenarios due to the knowledge deficiencies and the flawed pre-training data. Continual Learning (CL) is a commonly used method to address this issue. Traditional CL is task-oriented, using novel or factually accurate data to retrain LLMs from scratch. However, this method requires more task-related training data and incurs expensive training costs. To address this challenge, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, inspired by the 'summarize mistakes' learning skill, to achieve iterative refinement of LLMs. Specifically, the incorrect responses of LLMs indicate knowledge deficiencies related to the questions. Therefore, we collect corpora with these knowledge from multiple data sources and follow it up with iterative supplementary training for continuous, targeted knowledge updating and supplementation. Meanwhile, we developed two strategies to construct supplementary training sets to enhance the LLM's understanding of the corpus and prevent catastrophic forgetting. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this CL method. In the best case, our method resulted in a 17.00\% improvement in the accuracy of the LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuheng Wei, Guoyuan Wu, Matthew J. Barth, Amr Abdelraouf, Rohit Gupta, Kyungtae Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable prediction of vehicle trajectories at signalized intersections is crucial to urban traffic management and autonomous driving systems. However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantization lowers memory usage, computational requirements, and latency by utilizing fewer bits to represent model weights and activations. In this work, we investigate the generalization properties of quantized neural networks, a characteristic that has received little attention despite its implications on model performance. In particular, first, we develop a theoretical model for quantization in neural networks and demonstrate how quantization functions as a form of regularization. Second, motivated by recent work connecting the sharpness of the loss landscape and generalization, we derive an approximate bound for the generalization of quantized models conditioned on the amount of quantization noise. We then validate our hypothesis by experimenting with over 2000 models trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets on convolutional and transformer-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Hofman, Yusuf Sale, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty representation and quantification are paramount in machine learning and constitute an important prerequisite for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose novel measures for the quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, which are loss functions with the meaningful property that they incentivize the learner to predict ground-truth (conditional) probabilities. We assume two common representations of (epistemic) uncertainty, namely, in terms of a credal set, i.e. a set of probability distributions, or a second-order distribution, i.e., a distribution over probability distributions. Our framework establishes a natural bridge between these representations. We provide a formal justification of our approach and introduce new measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty as concrete instantiations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaki Adachi, Satoshi Hayakawa, Martin J{\o}rgensen, Saad Hamid, Harald Oberhauser, Michael A. Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingmin Sun, Yuxuan Liu, Zecheng Zhang, Hayden Schaeffer</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Remonda, Eduardo Veas, Granit Luzhnica</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Ran, Xiao-Ke Xu, Tao Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Networks offer a powerful approach to modeling complex systems by representing the underlying set of pairwise interactions. Link prediction is the task that predicts links of a network that are not directly visible, with profound applications in biological, social, and other complex systems. Despite intensive utilization of the topological feature in this task, it is unclear to what extent a feature can be leveraged to infer missing links. Here, we aim to unveil the capability of a topological feature in link prediction by identifying its prediction performance upper bound. We introduce a theoretical framework that is compatible with different indexes to gauge the feature, different prediction approaches to utilize the feature, and different metrics to quantify the prediction performance. The maximum capability of a topological feature follows a simple yet theoretically validated expression, which only depends on the extent to which the feature is held in missing and nonexistent links. Because a family of indexes based on the same feature shares the same upper bound, the potential of all others can be estimated from one single index. Furthermore, a feature's capability is lifted in the supervised prediction, which can be mathematically quantified, allowing us to estimate the benefit of applying machine learning algorithms. The universality of the pattern uncovered is empirically verified by 550 structurally diverse networks. The findings have applications in feature and method selection, and shed light on network characteristics that make a topological feature effective in link prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erim Yanik, Steven Schwaitzberg, Gene Yang, Xavier Intes, Jack Norfleet, Matthew Hackett, Suvranu De</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has achieved robust competency assessment in various high-stakes fields. However, the applicability of DL models is often hampered by their substantial data requirements and confinement to specific training domains. This prevents them from transitioning to new tasks where data is scarce. Therefore, domain adaptation emerges as a critical element for the practical implementation of DL in real-world scenarios. Herein, we introduce A-VBANet, a novel meta-learning model capable of delivering domain-agnostic skill assessment via one-shot learning. Our methodology has been tested by assessing surgical skills on five laparoscopic and robotic simulators and real-life laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our model successfully adapted with accuracies up to 99.5% in one-shot and 99.9% in few-shot settings for simulated tasks and 89.7% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study marks the first instance of a domain-agnostic methodology for skill assessment in critical fields setting a precedent for the broad application of DL across diverse real-life domains with limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, especially in medical imaging, faces challenges due to data scarcity and privacy concerns. Addressing these, we introduce Med-DDPM, a diffusion model designed for 3D semantic brain MRI synthesis. This model effectively tackles data scarcity and privacy issues by integrating semantic conditioning. This involves the channel-wise concatenation of a conditioning image to the model input, enabling control in image generation. Med-DDPM demonstrates superior stability and performance compared to existing 3D brain imaging synthesis methods. It generates diverse, anatomically coherent images with high visual fidelity. In terms of dice score accuracy in the tumor segmentation task, Med-DDPM achieves 0.6207, close to the 0.6531 accuracy of real images, and outperforms baseline models. Combined with real images, it further increases segmentation accuracy to 0.6675, showing the potential of our proposed method for data augmentation. This model represents the first use of a diffusion model in 3D semantic brain MRI synthesis, producing high-quality images. Its semantic conditioning feature also shows potential for image anonymization in biomedical imaging, addressing data and privacy issues. We provide the code and model weights for Med-DDPM on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med-ddpm/) to support reproducibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel one-stage end-to-end multi-person 2D pose estimation algorithm, known as Joint Coordinate Regression and Association (JCRA), that produces human pose joints and associations without requiring any post-processing. The proposed algorithm is fast, accurate, effective, and simple. The one-stage end-to-end network architecture significantly improves the inference speed of JCRA. Meanwhile, we devised a symmetric network structure for both the encoder and decoder, which ensures high accuracy in identifying keypoints. It follows an architecture that directly outputs part positions via a transformer network, resulting in a significant improvement in performance. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO and CrowdPose benchmarks demonstrate that JCRA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, JCRA demonstrates 69.2 mAP and is 78\% faster at inference acceleration than previous state-of-the-art bottom-up algorithms. The code for this algorithm will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MovePose, an optimized lightweight convolutional neural network designed specifically for real-time body pose estimation on CPU-based mobile devices. The current solutions do not provide satisfactory accuracy and speed for human posture estimation, and MovePose addresses this gap. It aims to maintain real-time performance while improving the accuracy of human posture estimation for mobile devices. Our MovePose algorithm has attained an Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 68.0 on the COCO \cite{cocodata} validation dataset. The MovePose algorithm displayed efficiency with a performance of 69+ frames per second (fps) when run on an Intel i9-10920x CPU. Additionally, it showcased an increased performance of 452+ fps on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. On an Android phone equipped with a Snapdragon 8 + 4G processor, the fps reached above 11. To enhance accuracy, we incorporated three techniques: deconvolution, large kernel convolution, and coordinate classification methods. Compared to basic upsampling, deconvolution is trainable, improves model capacity, and enhances the receptive field. Large kernel convolution strengthens these properties at a decreased computational cost. In summary, MovePose provides high accuracy and real-time performance, marking it a potential tool for a variety of applications, including those focused on mobile-side human posture estimation. The code and models for this algorithm will be made publicly accessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep neural networks, is of great interest. This heightened focus stems from the widespread use of AI-backed systems. These systems, often relying on intricate neural architectures, can exhibit behavior that is challenging to explain and comprehend. The interpretability of such models is a crucial component of building trusted systems. Many methods exist to approach this problem, but they do not apply straightforwardly to the quantum setting. Here, we explore the interpretability of quantum neural networks using local model-agnostic interpretability measures commonly utilized for classical neural networks. Following this analysis, we generalize a classical technique called LIME, introducing Q-LIME, which produces explanations of quantum neural networks. A feature of our explanations is the delineation of the region in which data samples have been given a random label, likely subjects of inherently random quantum measurements. We view this as a step toward understanding how to build responsible and accountable quantum AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Hirt, Domenico Campolo, Victoria Leong, Juan-Pablo Ortega</p>
<p>Abstract: Devising deep latent variable models for multi-modal data has been a long-standing theme in machine learning research. Multi-modal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been a popular generative model class that learns latent representations that jointly explain multiple modalities. Various objective functions for such models have been suggested, often motivated as lower bounds on the multi-modal data log-likelihood or from information-theoretic considerations. To encode latent variables from different modality subsets, Product-of-Experts (PoE) or Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation schemes have been routinely used and shown to yield different trade-offs, for instance, regarding their generative quality or consistency across multiple modalities. In this work, we consider a variational bound that can tightly approximate the data log-likelihood. We develop more flexible aggregation schemes that generalize PoE or MoE approaches by combining encoded features from different modalities based on permutation-invariant neural networks. Our numerical experiments illustrate trade-offs for multi-modal variational bounds and various aggregation schemes. We show that tighter variational bounds and more flexible aggregation models can become beneficial when one wants to approximate the true joint distribution over observed modalities and latent variables in identifiable models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lego is a well-known platform for prototyping pixelized objects. However, robotic Lego prototyping (i.e., manipulating Lego bricks) is challenging due to the tight connections and accuracy requirements. This paper investigates safe and efficient robotic Lego manipulation. In particular, this paper reduces the complexity of the manipulation by hardware-software co-design. An end-of-arm tool (EOAT) is designed, which reduces the problem dimension and allows large industrial robots to manipulate small Lego bricks. In addition, this paper uses evolution strategy to optimize the robot motion for Lego manipulation. Experiments demonstrate that the EOAT can reliably manipulate Lego bricks and the learning framework can effectively and safely improve the manipulation performance to a 100% success rate. The co-design is deployed to multiple robots (i.e., FANUC LR-mate 200id/7L and Yaskawa GP4) to demonstrate its generalizability and transferability. In the end, we show that the proposed solution enables sustainable robotic Lego prototyping, in which the robot can repeatedly assemble and disassemble different prototypes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Bao, Srinivasan Sivanandan, Theofanis Karaletsos</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful architecture in the realm of modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields, such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time. Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat (satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Schulze, Hod Lipson</p>
<p>Abstract: A robot self-model is a task-agnostic representation of the robot's physical morphology that can be used for motion planning tasks in the absence of a classical geometric kinematic model. In particular, when the latter is hard to engineer or the robot's kinematics change unexpectedly, human-free self-modeling is a necessary feature of truly autonomous agents. In this work, we leverage neural fields to allow a robot to self-model its kinematics as a neural-implicit query model learned only from 2D images annotated with camera poses and configurations. This enables significantly greater applicability than existing approaches which have been dependent on depth images or geometry knowledge. To this end, alongside a curricular data sampling strategy, we propose a new encoder-based neural density field architecture for dynamic object-centric scenes conditioned on high numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In a 7-DOF robot test setup, the learned self-model achieves a Chamfer-L2 distance of 2% of the robot's workspace dimension. We demonstrate the capabilities of this model on motion planning tasks as an exemplary downstream application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mufan Bill Li, Mihai Nica</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent analyses of neural networks with shaped activations (i.e. the activation function is scaled as the network size grows) have led to scaling limits described by differential equations. However, these results do not a priori tell us anything about "ordinary" unshaped networks, where the activation is unchanged as the network size grows. In this article, we find similar differential equation based asymptotic characterization for two types of unshaped networks.
  Firstly, we show that the following two architectures converge to the same infinite-depth-and-width limit at initialization: (i) a fully connected ResNet with a $d^{-1/2}$ factor on the residual branch, where $d$ is the network depth. (ii) a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with depth $d \ll$ width $n$ and shaped ReLU activation at rate $d^{-1/2}$.
  Secondly, for an unshaped MLP at initialization, we derive the first order asymptotic correction to the layerwise correlation. In particular, if $\rho_\ell$ is the correlation at layer $\ell$, then $q_t = \ell^2 (1 - \rho_\ell)$ with $t = \frac{\ell}{n}$ converges to an SDE with a singularity at $t=0$.
  These results together provide a connection between shaped and unshaped network architectures, and opens up the possibility of studying the effect of normalization methods and how it connects with shaping activation functions.</p>

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm termed Federated Stochastic Smoothed Gradient Descent Ascent (FESS-GDA), which utilizes the smoothing technique for federated minimax optimization. We prove that FESS-GDA can be uniformly used to solve several classes of federated minimax problems and prove new or better analytical convergence results for these settings. We showcase the practical efficiency of FESS-GDA in practical federated learning tasks of training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and fair classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihe Deng, Weitong Zhang, Zixiang Chen, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Misunderstandings arise not only in interpersonal communication but also between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). Such discrepancies can make LLMs interpret seemingly unambiguous questions in unexpected ways, yielding incorrect responses. While it is widely acknowledged that the quality of a prompt, such as a question, significantly impacts the quality of the response provided by LLMs, a systematic method for crafting questions that LLMs can better comprehend is still underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a method named `Rephrase and Respond' (RaR), which allows LLMs to rephrase and expand questions posed by humans and provide responses in a single prompt. This approach serves as a simple yet effective prompting method for improving performance. We also introduce a two-step variant of RaR, where a rephrasing LLM first rephrases the question and then passes the original and rephrased questions together to a different responding LLM. This facilitates the effective utilization of rephrased questions generated by one LLM with another. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the performance of different models across a wide range to tasks. We further provide a comprehensive comparison between RaR and the popular Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, both theoretically and empirically. We show that RaR is complementary to CoT and can be combined with CoT to achieve even better performance. Our work not only contributes to enhancing LLM performance efficiently and effectively but also sheds light on a fair evaluation of LLM capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Razavikia, Jos\'e Mairton Barros Da Silva J\'unior, Carlo Fischione</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate federated edge learning over a fading multiple access channel. To alleviate the communication burden between the edge devices and the access point, we introduce a pioneering digital over-the-air computation strategy employing q-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, culminating in a low latency communication scheme. Indeed, we propose a new federated edge learning framework in which edge devices use digital modulation for over-the-air uplink transmission to the edge server while they have no access to the channel state information. Furthermore, we incorporate multiple antennas at the edge server to overcome the fading inherent in wireless communication. We analyze the number of antennas required to mitigate the fading impact effectively. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for the mean squared error for the proposed federated learning with digital over-the-air uplink transmissions under both noisy and fading conditions. Leveraging the derived upper bound, we characterize the convergence rate of the learning process of a non-convex loss function in terms of the mean square error of gradients due to the fading channel. Furthermore, we substantiate the theoretical assurances through numerical experiments concerning mean square error and the convergence efficacy of the digital federated edge learning framework. Notably, the results demonstrate that augmenting the number of antennas at the edge server and adopting higher-order modulations improve the model accuracy up to 60\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyong Huang, Silong Yong, Xiaojian Ma, Xiongkun Linghu, Puhao Li, Yan Wang, Qing Li, Song-Chun Zhu, Baoxiong Jia, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging massive knowledge and learning schemes from large language models (LLMs), recent machine learning models show notable successes in building generalist agents that exhibit the capability of general-purpose task solving in diverse domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. However, a significant challenge remains as these models exhibit limited ability in understanding and interacting with the 3D world. We argue this limitation significantly hinders the current models from performing real-world tasks and further achieving general intelligence. To this end, we introduce an embodied multi-modal and multi-task generalist agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. Our proposed agent, referred to as LEO, is trained with shared LLM-based model architectures, objectives, and weights in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action instruction tuning. To facilitate the training, we meticulously curate and generate an extensive dataset comprising object-level and scene-level multi-modal tasks with exceeding scale and complexity, necessitating a deep understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, question answering, embodied reasoning, embodied navigation, and robotic manipulation. Our ablation results further provide valuable insights for the development of future embodied generalist agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling large scenes from unconstrained images has proven to be a major challenge in computer vision. Existing methods tackling in-the-wild scene modeling operate in closed-world settings, where no conditioning on priors acquired from real-world images is present. We propose RefinedFields, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method leveraging pre-trained models to improve in-the-wild scene modeling. We employ pre-trained networks to refine K-Planes representations via optimization guidance using an alternating training procedure. We carry out extensive experiments and verify the merit of our method on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections. RefinedFields enhances rendered scenes with richer details and improves upon its base representation on the task of novel view synthesis in the wild.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01818">Learning Machine Morality through Experience and Interaction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing interest in ensuring safety of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems calls for novel approaches to embedding morality into autonomous agents. Traditionally, this has been done by imposing explicit top-down rules or hard constraints on systems, for example by filtering system outputs through pre-defined ethical rules. Recently, instead, entirely bottom-up methods for learning implicit preferences from human behavior have become increasingly popular, such as those for training and fine-tuning Large Language Models. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modeled as a continuum, and argue that the majority of popular techniques lie at the extremes - either being fully hard-coded, or entirely learned, where no explicit statement of any moral principle is required. Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of methodology, we argue that more hybrid solutions are needed to create adaptable and robust, yet more controllable and interpretable agents.
  In particular, we present three case studies of recent works which use learning from experience (i.e., Reinforcement Learning) to explicitly provide moral principles to learning agents - either as intrinsic rewards, moral logical constraints or textual principles for language models. For example, using intrinsic rewards in Social Dilemma games, we demonstrate how it is possible to represent classical moral frameworks for agents. We also present an overview of the existing work in this area in order to provide empirical evidence for the potential of this hybrid approach. We then discuss strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of moral learning agents. Finally, we present open research questions and implications for the future of AI safety and ethics which are emerging from this framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Choudhary, Aashish Kolluri, Prateek Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: Training modern neural networks or models typically requires averaging over a sample of high-dimensional vectors. Poisoning attacks can skew or bias the average vectors used to train the model, forcing the model to learn specific patterns or avoid learning anything useful. Byzantine robust aggregation is a principled algorithmic defense against such biasing. Robust aggregators can bound the maximum bias in computing centrality statistics, such as mean, even when some fraction of inputs are arbitrarily corrupted. Designing such aggregators is challenging when dealing with high dimensions. However, the first polynomial-time algorithms with strong theoretical bounds on the bias have recently been proposed. Their bounds are independent of the number of dimensions, promising a conceptual limit on the power of poisoning attacks in their ongoing arms race against defenses.
  In this paper, we show a new attack called HIDRA on practical realization of strong defenses which subverts their claim of dimension-independent bias. HIDRA highlights a novel computational bottleneck that has not been a concern of prior information-theoretic analysis. Our experimental evaluation shows that our attacks almost completely destroy the model performance, whereas existing attacks with the same goal fail to have much effect. Our findings leave the arms race between poisoning attacks and provable defenses wide open.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Wang, Hui Huang, Radu State</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by abundant satellite imagery, machine learning-based approaches have recently been promoted to generate high-resolution crop cultivation maps to support many agricultural applications. One of the major challenges faced by these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the "direct transfer strategy" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately, the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or years. Despite recent efforts, such as the application of the deep adaptation neural network (DANN) model structure in the deep adaptation crop classification network (DACCN), to tackle the above cross-domain challenges, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when there is a large dissimilarity between the source and target regions. This paper introduces the Crop Mapping Spectral-temporal Generative Adversarial Neural Network (CropSTGAN), a novel solution for cross-domain challenges, that doesn't require target domain labels. CropSTGAN learns to transform the target domain's spectral features to those of the source domain, effectively bridging large dissimilarities. Additionally, it employs an identity loss to maintain the intrinsic local structure of the data. Comprehensive experiments across various regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In experiments, CropSTGAN is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Notably, CropSTGAN significantly outperforms these methods in scenarios with large data distribution dissimilarities between the target and source domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samaneh Shafee, Alysson Bessani, Pedro M. Ferreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge sharing about emerging threats is crucial in the rapidly advancing field of cybersecurity and forms the foundation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). In this context, Large Language Models are becoming increasingly significant in the field of cybersecurity, presenting a wide range of opportunities. This study surveys the performance of ChatGPT, GPT4all, Dolly, Stanford Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, Falcon, and Vicuna chatbots in binary classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks performed using Open Source INTelligence (OSINT). We utilize well-established data collected in previous research from Twitter to assess the competitiveness of these chatbots when compared to specialized models trained for those tasks. In binary classification experiments, Chatbot GPT-4 as a commercial model achieved an acceptable F1 score of 0.94, and the open-source GPT4all model achieved an F1 score of 0.90. However, concerning cybersecurity entity recognition, all evaluated chatbots have limitations and are less effective. This study demonstrates the capability of chatbots for OSINT binary classification and shows that they require further improvement in NER to effectively replace specially trained models. Our results shed light on the limitations of the LLM chatbots when compared to specialized models, and can help researchers improve chatbots technology with the objective to reduce the required effort to integrate machine learning in OSINT-based CTI tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianlin Liu, Mathieu Blondel, Carlos Riquelme, Joan Puigcerver</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are a promising way to scale up model capacity without significantly increasing computational cost. A key component of MoEs is the router, which decides which subset of parameters (experts) process which feature embeddings (tokens). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of routers in MoEs for computer vision tasks. We introduce a unified MoE formulation that subsumes different MoEs with two parametric routing tensors. This formulation covers both sparse MoE, which uses a binary or hard assignment between experts and tokens, and soft MoE, which uses a soft assignment between experts and weighted combinations of tokens. Routers for sparse MoEs can be further grouped into two variants: Token Choice, which matches experts to each token, and Expert Choice, which matches tokens to each expert. We conduct head-to-head experiments with 6 different routers, including existing routers from prior work and new ones we introduce. We show that (i) many routers originally developed for language modeling can be adapted to perform strongly in vision tasks, (ii) in sparse MoE, Expert Choice routers generally outperform Token Choice routers, and (iii) soft MoEs generally outperform sparse MoEs with a fixed compute budget. These results provide new insights regarding the crucial role of routers in vision MoE models.</p>

In this work we introduce Normalizing Flows for Quantum architectures, describe how to model and optimize such a flow and evaluate our method on example datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Marza, Laetitia Matignon, Olivier Simonin, Christian Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: Successfully addressing a wide variety of tasks is a core ability of autonomous agents, requiring flexibly adapting the underlying decision-making strategies and, as we argue in this work, also adapting the perception modules. An analogical argument would be the human visual system, which uses top-down signals to focus attention determined by the current task. Similarly, we adapt pre-trained large vision models conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of multi-task policy learning. We introduce task-conditioned adapters that do not require finetuning any pre-trained weights, combined with a single policy trained with behavior cloning and capable of addressing multiple tasks. We condition the visual adapters on task embeddings, which can be selected at inference if the task is known, or alternatively inferred from a set of example demonstrations. To this end, we propose a new optimization-based estimator. We evaluate the method on a wide variety of tasks from the CortexBench benchmark and show that, compared to existing work, it can be addressed with a single policy. In particular, we demonstrate that adapting visual features is a key design choice and that the method generalizes to unseen tasks given a few demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsang Kim, Seungjun Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning positional information of nodes in a graph is important for link prediction tasks. We propose a representation of positional information using representative nodes called landmarks. A small number of nodes with high degree centrality are selected as landmarks, which serve as reference points for the nodes' positions. We justify this selection strategy for well-known random graph models and derive closed-form bounds on the average path lengths involving landmarks. In a model for power-law graphs, we prove that landmarks provide asymptotically exact information on inter-node distances. We apply theoretical insights to practical networks and propose Hierarchical Position embedding with Landmarks and Clustering (HPLC). HPLC combines landmark selection and graph clustering, where the graph is partitioned into densely connected clusters in which nodes with the highest degree are selected as landmarks. HPLC leverages the positional information of nodes based on landmarks at various levels of hierarchy such as nodes' distances to landmarks, inter-landmark distances and hierarchical grouping of clusters. Experiments show that HPLC achieves state-of-the-art performances of link prediction on various datasets in terms of HIT@K, MRR, and AUC.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Pernot</p>
<p>Abstract: Average calibration of the prediction uncertainties of machine learning regression tasks can be tested in two ways: one is to estimate the calibration error (CE) as the difference between the mean absolute error (MSE) and the mean variance (MV) or mean squared uncertainty; the alternative is to compare the mean squared z-scores (ZMS) or scaled errors to 1. The problem is that both approaches might lead to different conclusions, as illustrated in this study for an ensemble of datasets from the recent machine learning uncertainty quantification (ML-UQ) literature. It is shown that the estimation of MV, MSE and their confidence intervals can become unreliable for heavy-tailed uncertainty and error distributions, which seems to be a common issue for ML-UQ datasets. By contrast, the ZMS statistic is less sensitive and offers the most reliable approach in this context. Unfortunately, the same problem affects also conditional calibrations statistics, such as the popular ENCE, and very likely post-hoc calibration methods based on similar statistics. As not much can be done to relieve this issue, except for a change of paradigm to intervals- or distribution-based UQ metrics, robust tailedness metrics are proposed to detect the potentially problematic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhao Shen, Ye Yuan, Srbuhi Mirzoyan, Ming Zhang, Chenguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new challenge to test the STEM skills of neural models. The problems in the real world often require solutions, combining knowledge from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Unlike existing datasets, our dataset requires the understanding of multimodal vision-language information of STEM. Our dataset features one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets for the challenge. It includes 448 skills and 1,073,146 questions spanning all STEM subjects. Compared to existing datasets that often focus on examining expert-level ability, our dataset includes fundamental skills and questions designed based on the K-12 curriculum. We also add state-of-the-art foundation models such as CLIP and GPT-3.5-Turbo to our benchmark. Results show that the recent model advances only help master a very limited number of lower grade-level skills (2.5% in the third grade) in our dataset. In fact, these models are still well below (averaging 54.7%) the performance of elementary students, not to mention near expert-level performance. To understand and increase the performance on our dataset, we teach the models on a training split of our dataset. Even though we observe improved performance, the model performance remains relatively low compared to average elementary students. To solve STEM problems, we will need novel algorithmic innovations from the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nischal Ashok Kumar, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Socratic method is a way of guiding students toward solving a problem independently without directly revealing the solution to the problem. Although this method has been shown to significantly improve student learning outcomes, it remains a complex labor-intensive task for instructors. Large language models (LLMs) can be used to augment human effort by automatically generating Socratic questions for students. However, existing methods that involve prompting these LLMs sometimes produce invalid outputs, e.g., those that directly reveal the solution to the problem or provide irrelevant or premature questions. To alleviate this problem, inspired by reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), we first propose a data augmentation method to enrich existing Socratic questioning datasets with questions that are invalid in specific ways. Next, we propose a method to optimize open-source LLMs such as LLama 2 to prefer ground-truth questions over generated invalid ones, using direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments on a Socratic questions dataset for student code debugging show that a DPO-optimized 7B LLama 2 model can effectively avoid generating invalid questions, and as a result, outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muchen Sun, Francesca Baldini, Peter Trautman, Todd Murphey</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of finding mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for crowd navigation. Mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium provides a rigorous model for the robot to anticipate uncertain yet cooperative human behavior in crowds, but the computation cost is often too high for scalable and real-time decision-making. Here we prove that a simple iterative Bayesian updating scheme converges to the Nash equilibrium of a mixed-strategy social navigation game. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven framework to construct the game by initializing agent strategies as Gaussian processes learned from human datasets. Based on the proposed mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium model, we develop a sampling-based crowd navigation framework that can be integrated into existing navigation methods and runs in real-time on a laptop CPU. We evaluate our framework in both simulated environments and real-world human datasets in unstructured environments. Our framework consistently outperforms both non-learning and learning-based methods on both safety and navigation efficiency and reaches human-level crowd navigation performance on top of a meta-planner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Lin, Antai Xie, Xiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of the current studies on autonomous vehicle decision-making and control tasks based on reinforcement learning are conducted in simulated environments. The training and testing of these studies are carried out under rule-based microscopic traffic flow, with little consideration of migrating them to real or near-real environments to test their performance. It may lead to a degradation in performance when the trained model is tested in more realistic traffic scenes. In this study, we propose a method to randomize the driving style and behavior of surrounding vehicles by randomizing certain parameters of the car-following model and the lane-changing model of rule-based microscopic traffic flow in SUMO. We trained policies with deep reinforcement learning algorithms under the domain randomized rule-based microscopic traffic flow in freeway and merging scenes, and then tested them separately in rule-based microscopic traffic flow and high-fidelity microscopic traffic flow. Results indicate that the policy trained under domain randomization traffic flow has significantly better success rate and calculative reward compared to the models trained under other microscopic traffic flows.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aneta Lisowska, Szymon Wilk, Laura Locati, Mimma Rizzo, Lucia Sacchi, Silvana Quaglini, Matteo Terzaghi, Valentina Tibollo, Mor Peleg</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Behavior Change Interventions (DBCIs) are supporting development of new health behaviors. Evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for their improvement and understanding of success factors. However, comprehensive guidance for developers, particularly in small-scale studies with ethical constraints, is limited. Building on the CAPABLE project, this study aims to define effective engagement with DBCIs for supporting cancer patients in enhancing their quality of life. We identify metrics for measuring engagement, explore the interest of both patients and clinicians in DBCIs, and propose hypotheses for assessing the impact of DBCIs in such contexts. Our findings suggest that clinician prescriptions significantly increase sustained engagement with mobile DBCIs. In addition, while one weekly engagement with a DBCI is sufficient to maintain well-being, transitioning from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation may require a higher level of engagement.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00044">UAlign: Pushing the Limit of Template-free Retrosynthesis Prediction with Unsupervised SMILES Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaipeng Zeng, Bo yang, Xin Zhao, Yu Zhang, Fan Nie, Xiaokang Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning poses a formidable challenge in the organic chemical industry. Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency.
  Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods.
  Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirreza Neshaei Moghaddam, Alex Olshevsky, Bahman Gharesifard</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11526">A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Methods for Parameter Estimation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Fein-Ashley</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, a stochastic process widely used in finance, physics, and biology. Parameter estimation of the OU process is a challenging problem. Thus, we review traditional tracking methods and compare them with novel applications of deep learning to estimate the parameters of the OU process. We use a multi-layer perceptron to estimate the parameters of the OU process and compare its performance with traditional parameter estimation methods, such as the Kalman filter and maximum likelihood estimation. We find that the multi-layer perceptron can accurately estimate the parameters of the OU process given a large dataset of observed trajectories; however, traditional parameter estimation methods may be more suitable for smaller datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging has been used for diagnosis of various conditions, making it one of the most powerful resources for effective patient care. Due to widespread availability, low cost, and low radiation, chest X-ray is one of the most sought after radiology examination for the diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. Due to advancements in medical imaging technologies and increasing patient load, current radiology workflow faces various challenges including increasing backlogs, working long hours, and increase in diagnostic errors. An automated computer-aided diagnosis system that can interpret chest X-rays to augment radiologists by providing actionable insights has potential to provide second opinion to radiologists, highlight relevant regions in the image, in turn expediting clinical workflow, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving patient care. In this study, we applied a novel architecture augmenting the DenseNet121 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multi-head self-attention mechanism using transformer, namely SA-DenseNet121, that can identify multiple thoracic diseases in chest X-rays. We conducted experiments on four of the largest chest X-ray datasets, namely, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, and IU-CXR. Experimental results in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) shows that augmenting CNN with self-attention has potential in diagnosing different thoracic diseases from chest X-rays. The proposed methodology has the potential to support the reading workflow, improve efficiency, and reduce diagnostic errors.</p>
