<p>Abstract: Throughout this project, we have attempted to develop an automatic evaluator that determines whether Basque language compositions meet the C1 level. To achieve our goal, we obtained 10,000 transcribed compositions through an agreement between HABE and HiTZ to train our system. We have developed different techniques to avoid data scarcity and system overfitting: EDA, SCL and regulation; We have also conducted tests with different Language Models to analyze their behavior. Finally, we have also performed analyses of different system behaviors to measure model calibration and the impact of artifacts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Geng, Qing Li, Herbert Woisetschlaeger, Zongxiong Chen, Yuxia Wang, Preslav Nakov, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the machine unlearning techniques within the context of large language models (LLMs), referred to as \textit{LLM unlearning}. LLM unlearning offers a principled approach to removing the influence of undesirable data (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) from LLMs, while preserving their overall utility without requiring full retraining. Despite growing research interest, there is no comprehensive survey that systematically organizes existing work and distills key insights; here, we aim to bridge this gap. We begin by introducing the definition and the paradigms of LLM unlearning, followed by a comprehensive taxonomy of existing unlearning studies. Next, we categorize current unlearning approaches, summarizing their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we review evaluation metrics and benchmarks, providing a structured overview of current assessment methodologies. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremi I. Kaczmarek, Jakub Pokrywka, Krzysztof Biedalak, Grzegorz Kurzyp, {\L}ukasz Grzybowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models revolutionized medical education by enabling scalable and efficient learning solutions. This paper presents a pipeline employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to prepare comments generation for Poland's State Specialization Examination (PES) based on verified resources. The system integrates these generated comments and source documents with a spaced repetition learning algorithm to enhance knowledge retention while minimizing cognitive overload. By employing a refined retrieval system, query rephraser, and an advanced reranker, our modified RAG solution promotes accuracy more than efficiency. Rigorous evaluation by medical annotators demonstrates improvements in key metrics such as document relevance, credibility, and logical coherence of generated content, proven by a series of experiments presented in the paper. This study highlights the potential of RAG systems to provide scalable, high-quality, and individualized educational resources, addressing non-English speaking users.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01869">From Small to Large Language Models: Revisiting the Federalist Papers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> So Won Jeong, Veronika Rockova</p>
<p>Abstract: For a long time, the authorship of the Federalist Papers had been a subject of inquiry and debate, not only by linguists and historians but also by statisticians. In what was arguably the first Bayesian case study, Mosteller and Wallace (1963) provided the first statistical evidence for attributing all disputed papers to Madison. Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from a lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the more popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a statistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate whether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can be useful for stylometry and attribution. We explain differences between various word/phrase embeddings and discuss how to aggregate them in a document. Contrary to our expectations, we exemplify that dimension expansion with word embeddings may not always be beneficial for attribution relative to dimension reduction with topic embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that default LLM embeddings (even after manual fine-tuning) may not consistently improve authorship attribution accuracy. Instead, Bayesian analysis with topic embeddings trained on ``function words" yields superior out-of-sample classification performance. This suggests that traditional (small) statistical language models, with their interpretability and solid theoretical foundation, can offer significant advantages in authorship attribution tasks. The code used in this analysis is available at github.com/sowonjeong/slm-to-llm</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Timoshenko, Chengfeng Mao, John R. Hauser</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying customer needs (CNs) is important for product management, product development, and marketing. Applications rely on professional analysts interpreting textual data (e.g., interview transcripts, online reviews) to understand the nuances of customer experience and concisely formulate "jobs to be done." The task is cognitively complex and time-consuming. Current practice facilitates the process with keyword search and machine learning but relies on human judgment to formulate CNs. We examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically extract CNs. Because evaluating CNs requires professional judgment, we partnered with a marketing consulting firm to conduct a blind study of CNs extracted by: (1) a foundational LLM with prompt engineering only (Base LLM), (2) an LLM fine-tuned with professionally identified CNs (SFT LLM), and (3) professional analysts. The SFT LLM performs as well as or better than professional analysts when extracting CNs. The extracted CNs are well-formulated, sufficiently specific to identify opportunities, and justified by source content (no hallucinations). The SFT LLM is efficient and provides more complete coverage of CNs. The Base LLM was not sufficiently accurate or specific. Organizations can rely on SFT LLMs to reduce manual effort, enhance the precision of CN articulation, and provide improved insight for innovation and marketing strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Kong, Yiyuan Yang, Yoontae Hwang, Wenjie Du, Stefan Zohren, Zhangyang Wang, Ming Jin, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are foundational in finance, healthcare, and energy domains. However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, executable codes, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and results have all been open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed-Khalil Ghali, Abdelrahman Farrag, Sarah Lam, Daehan Won</p>
<p>Abstract: Thematic analysis of social media posts provides a major understanding of public discourse, yet traditional methods often struggle to capture the complexity and nuance of unstructured, large-scale text data. This study introduces a novel methodology for thematic analysis that integrates tweet embeddings from pre-trained language models, dimensionality reduction using and matrix factorization, and generative AI to identify and refine latent themes. Our approach clusters compressed tweet representations and employs generative AI to extract and articulate themes through an agentic Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, with a secondary LLM for quality assurance. This methodology is applied to tweets from the autistic community, a group that increasingly uses social media to discuss their experiences and challenges. By automating the thematic extraction process, the aim is to uncover key insights while maintaining the richness of the original discourse. This autism case study demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in improving thematic analysis of social media data, offering a scalable and adaptable framework that can be applied to diverse contexts. The results highlight the potential of combining machine learning and Generative AI to enhance the depth and accuracy of theme identification in online communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies such as BERT, FinBERT and ULMFiT for sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts. The objective is to investigate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be leveraged to extract sentiment from large-scale financial transcripts, thereby aiding in more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies. We examine the strengths and limitations of each model in the context of financial sentiment analysis, focusing on data preprocessing requirements, computational efficiency, and model optimization. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate their performance using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we discuss potential enhancements to improve the effectiveness of these models in financial text analysis, providing insights into their applicability for real-world financial decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adiba Mahbub Proma, Neeley Pate, James Druckman, Gourab Ghoshal, Hangfeng He, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify online misinformation, they also show promise in tackling misinformation. In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs -- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails. Our results have implications for both researchers and non-technical users.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01903">PsychBench: A comprehensive and professional benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLM-assisted psychiatric clinical practice</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxi Wang, Shuyu Liu, Ling Zhang, Xuequan Zhu, Rui Yang, Xinzhu Zhou, Fei Wu, Zhi Yang, Cheng Jin, Gang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: As deep learning models grow in complexity, achieving model-agnostic interpretability becomes increasingly vital. In this work, we employ post-hoc conceptual contrastive edits to expose noteworthy patterns and biases imprinted in representations of retrieval models. We systematically design optimal and controllable contrastive interventions targeting various parts of speech, and effectively apply them to explain both linguistic and visiolinguistic pre-trained models in a black-box manner. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric to assess the per-word impact of contrastive interventions on model outcomes, providing a comprehensive evaluation of each intervention's effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaying Hong, Thanet Markchom, Jianfei Xu, Tong Wu, Huizhi Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 3 (Mu-SHROOM) focuses on detecting hallucinations in content generated by various large language models (LLMs) across multiple languages. This task involves not only identifying the presence of hallucinations but also pinpointing their specific occurrences. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces two methods: modified RefChecker and modified SelfCheckGPT. The modified RefChecker integrates prompt-based factual verification into References, structuring them as claim-based tests rather than single external knowledge sources. The modified SelfCheckGPT incorporates external knowledge to overcome its reliance on internal knowledge. In addition, both methods' original prompt designs are enhanced to identify hallucinated words within LLM-generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving a high ranking on the test dataset in detecting hallucinations across various languages, with an average IoU of 0.5310 and an average COR of 0.5669.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, but their safety under adversarial conditions remains a challenge. This study examines the impact of output length on the robustness of DeepSeek-R1, particularly in Forced Thinking scenarios. We analyze responses across various adversarial prompts and find that while longer outputs can improve safety through self-correction, certain attack types exploit extended generations. Our findings suggest that output length should be dynamically controlled to balance reasoning effectiveness and security. We propose reinforcement learning-based policy adjustments and adaptive token length regulation to enhance LLM safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to process non-human-readable text sequences, such as jailbreak prompts, often viewed as a bug for aligned LLMs. In this work, we present a systematic investigation challenging this perception, demonstrating that unnatural languages - strings that appear incomprehensible to humans but maintain semantic meanings for LLMs - contain latent features usable by models. Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Zhe Zheng, Linjuan Wu, Wenqi Zhang, Yuchen Yan, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness by fine-tuning on error-correction augmented data using selective masking mechanism, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 79% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 48.34% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across varying complexity levels and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 with substantially fewer computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akito Nakanishi, Yukie Sano, Geng Liu, Francesco Pierri</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted growing interest for their significant potential, though concerns have rapidly emerged regarding unsafe behaviors stemming from inherent stereotypes and biases.Most research on stereotypes in LLMs has primarily relied on indirect evaluation setups, in which models are prompted to select between pairs of sentences associated with particular social groups. Recently, direct evaluation methods have emerged, examining open-ended model responses to overcome limitations of previous approaches, such as annotator biases.Most existing studies have focused on English-centric LLMs, whereas research on non-English models--particularly Japanese--remains sparse, despite the growing development and adoption of these models.This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to stereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups.We constructed 3,612 prompts by combining 301 social group terms--categorized by age, gender, and other attributes--with 12 stereotype-inducing templates in Japanese.Responses were analyzed from three foundational models trained respectively on Japanese, English, and Chinese language.Our findings reveal that LLM-jp, a Japanese native model, exhibits the lowest refusal rate and is more likely to generate toxic and negative responses compared to other models.Additionally, prompt format significantly influence the output of all models, and the generated responses include exaggerated reactions toward specific social groups, varying across models.These findings underscore the insufficient ethical safety mechanisms in Japanese LLMs and demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can produce biased outputs when processing Japanese-language prompts.We advocate for improving safety mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies in Japanese LLMs, contributing to ongoing discussions on AI ethics beyond linguistic boundaries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manual curation of evaluation datasets is struggling to keep up with the rapidly expanding capabilities and deployment scenarios of language models. Towards scalable model profiling, we introduce and validate a framework for evaluating LLMs, called Adaptive Evaluations. Adaptive evaluations use scaffolded language models (evaluator agents) to search through a target model's behavior on a domain dataset and create difficult questions (tasks) that can discover and probe the model's failure modes. We find that frontier models lack consistency when adaptively probed with our framework on a diverse suite of datasets and tasks, including but not limited to legal reasoning, forecasting, and online harassment. Generated questions pass human validity checks and often transfer to other models with different capability profiles, demonstrating that adaptive evaluations can also be used to create difficult domain-specific datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yekyung Kim, Jenna Russell, Marzena Karpinska, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ONERULER, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate long-context language models across 26 languages. ONERULER adapts the English-only RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al., 2024) by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the "needle-in-a-haystack" task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We create ONERULER through a two-step process, first writing English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages. Experiments with both open-weight and closed LLMs reveal a widening performance gap between low- and high-resource languages as context length increases from 8K to 128K tokens. Surprisingly, English is not the top-performing language on long-context tasks (ranked 6th out of 26), with Polish emerging as the top language. Our experiments also show that many LLMs (particularly OpenAI's o3-mini-high) incorrectly predict the absence of an answer, even in high-resource languages. Finally, in cross-lingual scenarios where instructions and context appear in different languages, performance can fluctuate by up to 20% depending on the instruction language. We hope the release of ONERULER will facilitate future research into improving multilingual and cross-lingual long-context training pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tin Nguyen, Logan Bolton, Mohammad Reza Taesiri, Anh Totti Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angana Borah, Marwa Houalla, Rada Mihalcea</p>
<p>Abstract: Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%. Bridging social psychology and AI, our work provides insights to navigate real-world interactions using LLMs while addressing belief-driven biases.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines how large language models categorize sentences from scientific papers using prompt engineering. We use two advanced web-based models, GPT-4o (by OpenAI) and DeepSeek R1, to classify sentences into predefined relationship categories. DeepSeek R1 has been tested on benchmark datasets in its technical report. However, its performance in scientific text categorization remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new evaluation method designed specifically for this task. We also compile a dataset of cleaned scientific papers from diverse domains. This dataset provides a platform for comparing the two models. Using this dataset, we analyze their effectiveness and consistency in categorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angana Borah, Rada Mihalcea, Ver\'onica P\'erez-Rosas</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing challenges in misinformation exposure and susceptibility vary across demographic groups, as some populations are more vulnerable to misinformation than others. Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> P. Myles Eugenio</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning in the brain is local and unsupervised (Hebbian). We derive the foundations of an effective human language model inspired by these microscopic constraints. It has two parts: (1) a hierarchy of neurons which learns to tokenize words from text (whichiswhatyoudowhenyoureadthis); and (2) additional neurons which bind the learned symanticless patterns of the tokenizer into a symanticful token (an embedding). The model permits continuous parallel learning without forgetting; and is a powerful tokenizer which performs renormalization group. This allows it to exploit redundancy, such that it generates tokens which are always decomposable into a basis set (e.g an alphabet), and can mix features learned from multiple languages. We find that the structure of this model allows it to learn a natural language morphology WITHOUT data. The language data generated by this model predicts the correct distribution of word-forming patterns observed in real languages, and further demonstrates why microscopically human speech is broken up into words. This model provides the basis for understanding the microscopic origins of language and human creativity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and interpreting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge. Patchscopes introduced a method for probing internal activations by patching them into new prompts, prompting models to self-explain their hidden representations. We introduce Superscopes, a technique that systematically amplifies superposed features in MLP outputs (multilayer perceptron) and hidden states before patching them into new contexts. Inspired by the "features as directions" perspective and the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) approach from diffusion models, Superscopes amplifies weak but meaningful features, enabling the interpretation of internal representations that previous methods failed to explain-all without requiring additional training. This approach provides new insights into how LLMs build context and represent complex concepts, further advancing mechanistic interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsol Kim, James Evans, Aaron Schein</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, \texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personality Computing is a field at the intersection of Personality Psychology and Computer Science. Started in 2005, research in the field utilizes computational methods to understand and predict human personality traits. The expansion of the field has been very rapid and, by analyzing digital footprints (text, images, social media, etc.), it helped to develop systems that recognize and even replicate human personality. While offering promising applications in talent recruiting, marketing and healthcare, the ethical implications of Personality Computing are significant. Concerns include data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for manipulation by personality-aware Artificial Intelligence. This paper provides an overview of the field, explores key methodologies, discusses the challenges and threats, and outlines potential future directions for responsible development and deployment of Personality Computing technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Chang, Yingcong Li, Muti Kara, Samet Oymak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: The in-context learning capabilities of modern language models have motivated a deeper mathematical understanding of sequence models. A line of recent work has shown that linear attention models can emulate projected gradient descent iterations to implicitly learn the task vector from the data provided in the context window. In this work, we consider a novel setting where the global task distribution can be partitioned into a union of conditional task distributions. We then examine the use of task-specific prompts and prediction heads for learning the prior information associated with the conditional task distribution using a one-layer attention model. Our results on loss landscape show that task-specific prompts facilitate a covariance-mean decoupling where prompt-tuning explains the conditional mean of the distribution whereas the variance is learned/explained through in-context learning. Incorporating task-specific head further aids this process by entirely decoupling estimation of mean and variance components. This covariance-mean perspective similarly explains how jointly training prompt and attention weights can provably help over fine-tuning after pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangchi Yuan, Chunhui Zhang, Zheyuan Liu, Dachuan Shi, Soroush Vosoughi, Wenke Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As scaled language models (LMs) approach human-level reasoning capabilities, self-improvement emerges as a solution to synthesizing high-quality data corpus. While previous research has identified model collapse as a risk in self-improvement, where model outputs become increasingly deterministic, we discover a more fundamental challenge: the superficial self-improved reasoners phenomenon. In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show improved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their generalized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to memorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM architecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are concentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial learning. To address this, we propose Iterative Model Merging (IMM), a method that strategically combines weights from original and self-improved models to preserve generalization while incorporating genuine reasoning improvements. Our approach effectively mitigates both LM collapse and superficial learning, moving towards more stable self-improving systems.</p>

In detail, (1) we estimate the ID of token embeddings in small-scale language models and also modern large language models, finding that the embedding spaces often reside on lower-dimensional manifolds compared to their extrinsic dimensionality; (2) we measure the ID across various model sizes and observe an increase in redundancy rates as the model scale grows; (3) we measure the dynamics of IDs during the training process, and find a rapid ID drop in the early stages of training. Moreover, (4) when LoRA is applied to the embedding layers, we observe a sudden drop in perplexity around the estimated IDs, suggesting that the ID can serve as a useful guideline for LoRA application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Lui Geh, Zilei Shao, Guy Van den Broeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM pipelines account for only one possible tokenization for a given string, ignoring exponentially many alternative tokenizations during training and inference. For example, the standard Llama3 tokenization of penguin is [p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixun Chen, Ming Li, Yuxuan Huang, Yali Du, Meng Fang, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zheng, Hongshen Xu, Yuncong Liu, Lu Chen, Pascale Fung, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate due to misaligned self-awareness, generating erroneous outputs when addressing queries beyond their knowledge boundaries. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations via uncertainty estimation or query rejection, they suffer from computational inefficiency or sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate use of high-confidence outputs. For uncertain predictions, a slow refinement model conducts targeted reasoning to improve accuracy. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. Our work establishes a scalable paradigm for advancing LLM reliability and balancing accuracy and practical utility in error-sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Wu, Xiao Liu, Jiayi Li, Lingpeng Kong, Yansong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Model-based agents have demonstrated substantial progress in task completion, existing evaluation benchmarks tend to overemphasize single-task performance, with insufficient attention given to the crucial aspects of multitask planning and execution efficiency required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present Recipe2Plan, a novel benchmark framework based on real-world cooking scenarios. Unlike conventional benchmarks, Recipe2Plan challenges agents to optimize cooking time through parallel task execution while respecting temporal constraints i.e. specific actions need to be performed within a particular time intervals following the preceding steps. Overly aggressive local parallelization may disrupt this constraint, potentially compromising the entire cooking process. This strict time constraint between actions raises a unique challenge for agents to balance between maximizing concurrent operations and adhering to critical timing constraints. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal challenges in maintaining this balance between efficiency and feasibility. The results highlight the need for improved temporal awareness and global multitasking capabilities in large language models.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, plays a crucial role in enabling non-experts to interact with databases. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text-to-SQL performance, existing approaches face notable limitations in real-world text-to-SQL applications. Prompting-based methods often depend on closed-source LLMs, which are expensive, raise privacy concerns, and lack customization. Fine-tuning-based methods, on the other hand, suffer from poor generalizability due to the limited coverage of publicly available training data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and scalable text-to-SQL data synthesis framework for automatically synthesizing large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets without extensive human intervention. Using this framework, we introduce SynSQL-2.5M, the first million-scale text-to-SQL dataset, containing 2.5 million samples spanning over 16,000 synthetic databases. Each sample includes a database, SQL query, natural language question, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solution. Leveraging SynSQL-2.5M, we develop OmniSQL, a powerful open-source text-to-SQL model available in three sizes: 7B, 14B, and 32B. Extensive evaluations across nine datasets demonstrate that OmniSQL achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing leading closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, despite its smaller size. We release all code, datasets, and models to support further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown promising performance on various machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, the uninterpretability of deep learning models severely restricts the usage domains that require feature explanations, such as text correction. Therefore, a novel interpretable deep learning model (named AxBERT) is proposed for Chinese spelling correction by aligning with an associative knowledge network (AKN). Wherein AKN is constructed based on the co-occurrence relations among Chinese characters, which denotes the interpretable statistic logic contrasted with uninterpretable BERT logic. And a translator matrix between BERT and AKN is introduced for the alignment and regulation of the attention component in BERT. In addition, a weight regulator is designed to adjust the attention distributions in BERT to appropriately model the sentence semantics. Experimental results on SIGHAN datasets demonstrate that AxBERT can achieve extraordinary performance, especially upon model precision compared to baselines. Our interpretable analysis, together with qualitative reasoning, can effectively illustrate the interpretability of AxBERT.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models to solve complex mathematical problems has progressed significantly, particularly for tasks requiring advanced reasoning. However, the scarcity of sufficiently challenging problems, particularly at the Olympiad level, hinders further advancements. In this work, we introduce PromptCoT, a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality Olympiad-level math problems. The proposed method synthesizes complex problems based on mathematical concepts and the rationale behind problem construction, emulating the thought processes of experienced problem designers. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that an optimal rationale should maximize both the likelihood of rationale generation given the associated concepts and the likelihood of problem generation conditioned on both the rationale and the concepts. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, where it consistently outperforms existing problem generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PromptCoT exhibits superior data scalability, consistently maintaining high performance as the dataset size increases, outperforming the baselines.

<p>Abstract: Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media has significantly reshaped interpersonal communication, fostering connectivity while also enabling the proliferation of misinformation. The unchecked spread of false narratives has profound effects on mental health, contributing to increased stress, anxiety, and misinformation-driven paranoia. This study presents a hybrid transformer-based approach using a RoBERTa-LSTM classifier to detect misinformation, assess its impact on mental health, and classify disorders linked to misinformation exposure. The proposed models demonstrate accuracy rates of 98.4, 87.8, and 77.3 in detecting misinformation, mental health implications, and disorder classification, respectively. Furthermore, Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Independence (p-value = 0.003871) validates the direct correlation between misinformation and deteriorating mental well-being. This study underscores the urgent need for better misinformation management strategies to mitigate its psychological repercussions. Future research could explore broader datasets incorporating linguistic, demographic, and cultural variables to deepen the understanding of misinformation-induced mental health distress.</p>

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Li, Yuhao Du, Xiaoqi Jiao, Yiwen Guo, Yuege Feng, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao, Jinpeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting high-quality and diverse training samples from extensive datasets plays a crucial role in reducing training overhead and enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies fall short in assessing the overall value of selected data, focusing primarily on individual quality, and struggle to strike an effective balance between ensuring diversity and minimizing data point traversals. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel choice-based sample selection framework that shifts the focus from evaluating individual sample quality to comparing the contribution value of different samples when incorporated into the subset. Thanks to the advanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we utilize LLMs to evaluate the value of each option during the selection process. Furthermore, we design a greedy sampling process where samples are incrementally added to the subset, thereby improving efficiency by eliminating the need for exhaustive traversal of the entire dataset with the limited budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that selected data from our method not only surpass the performance of the full dataset but also achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) studies, while requiring fewer selections. Moreover, we validate our approach on a larger medical dataset, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhua Liu, Lijun Li, Ruizhe Chen, Yuxian Jiang, Tong Zhu, Wenliang Chen, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant method for controlling language model outputs, it suffers from high computational costs and training instability. Guided decoding, especially value-guided methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by controlling outputs without re-training models. However, the accuracy of the value function is crucial for value-guided decoding, as inaccuracies can lead to suboptimal decision-making and degraded performance. Existing methods struggle with accurately estimating the optimal value function, leading to less effective control. We propose Iterative Value Function Optimization, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: Monte Carlo Value Estimation, which reduces estimation variance by exploring diverse trajectories, and Iterative On-Policy Optimization, which progressively improves value estimation through collecting trajectories from value-guided policies. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of value-guided decoding approaches in aligning language models. These approaches not only achieve alignment but also significantly reduce computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in advancing medical applications, yet their capabilities in addressing medical ethics challenges remain underexplored. This paper introduces MedEthicEval, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs in the domain of medical ethics. Our framework encompasses two key components: knowledge, assessing the models' grasp of medical ethics principles, and application, focusing on their ability to apply these principles across diverse scenarios. To support this benchmark, we consulted with medical ethics researchers and developed three datasets addressing distinct ethical challenges: blatant violations of medical ethics, priority dilemmas with clear inclinations, and equilibrium dilemmas without obvious resolutions. MedEthicEval serves as a critical tool for understanding LLMs' ethical reasoning in healthcare, paving the way for their responsible and effective use in medical contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Sun, Qianlong Du, Fuwei Cui, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Qiu, Xiaoyan Zhao, Yang Zhang, Yimeng Bai, Wenjie Wang, Hong Cheng, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical step in facilitating their widespread application to enhance individual life experiences. In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual's historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL significantly enhances LLM personalization. We release our code at https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohan Patnaik, Milan Aggarwal, Sumit Bhatia, Balaji Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Very large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have shown the ability to handle complex tasks by generating and self-refining step-by-step rationales. Smaller language models (SLMs), typically with < 13B parameters, have been improved by using the data generated from very-large LMs through knowledge distillation. However, various practical constraints such as API costs, copyright, legal and ethical policies restrict using large (often opaque) models to train smaller models for commercial use. Limited success has been achieved at improving the ability of an SLM to explore the space of possible rationales and evaluate them by itself through self-deliberation. To address this, we propose COALITION, a trainable framework that facilitates interaction between two variants of the same SLM and trains them to generate and refine rationales optimized for the end-task. The variants exhibit different behaviors to produce a set of diverse candidate rationales during the generation and refinement steps. The model is then trained via Selective Rationale Optimization (SRO) to prefer generating rationale candidates that maximize the likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. During inference, COALITION employs a controller to select the suitable variant for generating and refining the rationales. On five different datasets covering mathematical problems, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference, COALITION outperforms several baselines by up to 5%. Our ablation studies reveal that cross-communication between the two variants performs better than using the single model to self-refine the rationales. We also demonstrate the applicability of COALITION for LMs of varying scales (4B to 14B parameters) and model families (Mistral, Llama, Qwen, Phi). We release the code for this work at https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/coalition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Yangyifan Xu, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context modeling has drawn more and more attention in the area of Large Language Models (LLMs). Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data. Experimental results show that our LADM framework significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on multiple long-context tasks with only 1B tokens for continual training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzuo Li, Kehai Chen, Yunfei Long, Xuefeng Bai, Yong Xu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced in integrating diverse modalities but frequently suffer from hallucination. A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter challenges in efficiently processing long-text queries, as seen in applications like enterprise document analysis and financial report comprehension. While conventional solutions employ long-context processing or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), they suffer from prohibitive input expenses or incomplete information. Recent advancements adopt context compression and dynamic retrieval loops, but still sacrifice critical details or incur iterative costs.To address these limitations, we propose OkraLong, a novel framework that flexibly optimizes the entire processing workflow. Unlike prior static or coarse-grained adaptive strategies, OkraLong adopts fine-grained orchestration through three synergistic components: analyzer, organizer and executor. The analyzer characterizes the task states, which guide the organizer in dynamically scheduling the workflow. The executor carries out the execution and generates the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate that OkraLong not only enhances answer accuracy but also achieves cost-effectiveness across a variety of datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for LLM calibration that fine-tunes LLMs to elicit calibrated confidence estimations in their answers to factual questions. We model the problem as a betting game where the model predicts a confidence score together with every answer, and design a reward function that penalizes both over and under-confidence. We prove that under our reward design an optimal policy would result in a perfectly calibrated confidence estimation. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved confidence calibration and generalization to new tasks without re-training, indicating that our approach teaches a general confidence awareness. This approach enables the training of inherently calibrated LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-Robin Lange, Niklas Benner, Lars Gr\"onberg, Aymane Hachcham, Imene Kolli, Jonas Rieger, Carsten Jentsch</p>
<p>Abstract: Text data is inherently temporal. The meaning of words and phrases changes over time, and the context in which they are used is constantly evolving. This is not just true for social media data, where the language used is rapidly influenced by current events, memes and trends, but also for journalistic, economic or political text data. Most NLP techniques however consider the corpus at hand to be homogenous in regard to time. This is a simplification that can lead to biased results, as the meaning of words and phrases can change over time. For instance, running a classic Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a corpus that spans several years is not enough to capture changes in the topics over time, but only portraits an "average" topic distribution over the whole time span. Researchers have developed a number of tools for analyzing text data over time. However, these tools are often scattered across different packages and libraries, making it difficult for researchers to use them in a consistent and reproducible way. The ttta package is supposed to serve as a collection of tools for analyzing text data over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Liu, Zixuan Li, Long Bai, Yuxin Zuo, Daozhu Xu, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing a general-purpose extraction system that can extract events with massive types is a long-standing target in Event Extraction (EE). In doing so, the challenge comes from two aspects: 1) The absence of an efficient and effective annotation method. 2) The absence of a powerful extraction method can handle massive types. For the first challenge, we propose a collaborative annotation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through collaboration among multiple LLMs, it first refines annotations of trigger words from distant supervision and then carries out argument annotation. Next, a voting phase consolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we create the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000 samples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we propose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE. To overcome the limited context length of LLMs, LLM-PEE first recalls candidate event types and then splits them into multiple partitions for LLMs to extract events. The results in the supervised setting show that LLM-PEE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 5.4 in event detection and 6.1 in argument extraction. In the zero-shot setting, LLM-PEE achieves up to 12.9 improvement compared to mainstream LLMs, demonstrating its strong generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decoder-based transformers, while revolutionizing language modeling and scaling to immense sizes, have not completely overtaken encoder-heavy architectures in natural language processing. Specifically, encoder-only models remain dominant in tasks like classification, regression, and ranking. This is primarily due to the inherent structure of decoder-based models, which limits their direct applicability to these tasks. In this paper, we introduce Gemma Encoder, adapting the powerful Gemma decoder model to an encoder architecture, thereby unlocking its potential for a wider range of non-generative applications. To optimize the adaptation from decoder to encoder, we systematically analyze various pooling strategies, attention mechanisms, and hyperparameters (e.g., dropout rate). Furthermore, we benchmark Gemma Encoder against established approaches on the GLUE benchmarks, and MS MARCO ranking benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Tang, Yong Liu, Dongjie Zhang, Xing Wu, Debing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the fine-tuned LLMs encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. To address this issue, inspired by theoretical insights of null space, we propose LoRA-Null, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation via null space, which builds adapters initialized from the null space of the pre-trained knowledge activation. Concretely, we randomly collect a few data samples and capture their activations after passing through the LLM layer. We perform Singular Value Decomposition on the input activations to obtain their null space. We use the projection of the pre-trained weights onto the null space as the initialization for adapters. Experimental results demonstrate that this initialization approach can effectively preserve the original pre-trained world knowledge of the LLMs during fine-tuning. Additionally, if we freeze the values of the down-projection matrices during fine-tuning, it achieves even better preservation of the pre-trained world knowledge. LoRA-Null effectively preserves pre-trained world knowledge while maintaining strong fine-tuning performance, as validated by extensive experiments on LLaMA series (LLaMA2, LLaMA3, LLaMA3.1, and LLaMA3.2) across Code, Math, and Instruction Following tasks. We also provide a theoretical guarantee for the capacity of LoRA-Null to retain pre-trained knowledge. Code is in https://github.com/HungerPWAY/LoRA-Null.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyuan Lai, Xiao Zhang, Malvina Nissim</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large language models (LLMs) have proved able to address some complex reasoning tasks, we also know that they are highly sensitive to input variation, which can lead to different solution paths and final answers. Answer consistency across input variations can thus be taken as a sign of stronger confidence. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a framework, {\em Multidimensional Reasoning Consistency} where, focusing on math problems, models are systematically pushed to diversify solution paths towards a final answer, thereby testing them for answer consistency across multiple input variations. We induce variations in (i) order of shots in prompt, (ii) problem phrasing, and (iii) languages used. Extensive experiments on a large range of open-source state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes show that reasoning consistency differs by variation dimension, and that by aggregating consistency across dimensions, our framework consistently enhances mathematical reasoning performance on both monolingual dataset GSM8K and multilingual dataset MGSM, especially for smaller models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The #StopAsianHate (SAH) movement is a broad social movement against violence targeting Asians and Asian Americans, beginning in 2021 in response to racial discrimination related to COVID-19 and sparking worldwide conversation about anti-Asian hate. However, research on the online SAH movement has focused on English-speaking participants so the spread of the movement outside of the United States is largely unknown. In addition, there have been no long-term studies of SAH so the extent to which it has been successfully sustained over time is not well understood. We present an analysis of 6.5 million "#StopAsianHate" tweets from 2.2 million users all over the globe and spanning 60 different languages, constituting the first study of the non-English and transnational component of the online SAH movement. Using a combination of topic modeling, user modeling, and hand annotation, we identify and characterize the dominant discussions and users participating in the movement and draw comparisons of English versus non-English topics and users. We discover clear differences in events driving topics, where spikes in English tweets are driven by violent crimes in the US but spikes in non-English tweets are driven by transnational incidents of anti-Asian sentiment towards symbolic representatives of Asian nations. We also find that global K-pop fans were quick to adopt the SAH movement and, in fact, sustained it for longer than any other user group. Our work contributes to understanding the transnationality and evolution of the SAH movement, and more generally to exploring upward scale shift and public attention in large-scale multilingual online activism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keti Korini, Christian Bizer</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the semantics of columns in relational tables is an important pre-processing step for indexing data lakes in order to provide rich data search. An approach to establishing such understanding is column type annotation (CTA) where the goal is to annotate table columns with terms from a given vocabulary. This paper experimentally compares different knowledge generation and self-refinement strategies for LLM-based column type annotation. The strategies include using LLMs to generate term definitions, error-based refinement of term definitions, self-correction, and fine-tuning using examples and term definitions. We evaluate these strategies along two dimensions: effectiveness measured as F1 performance and efficiency measured in terms of token usage and cost. Our experiments show that the best performing strategy depends on the model/dataset combination. We find that using training data to generate label definitions outperforms using the same data as demonstrations for in-context learning for two out of three datasets using OpenAI models. The experiments further show that using the LLMs to refine label definitions brings an average increase of 3.9% F1 in 10 out of 12 setups compared to the performance of the non-refined definitions. Combining fine-tuned models with self-refined term definitions results in the overall highest performance, outperforming zero-shot prompting fine-tuned models by at least 3% in F1 score. The costs analysis shows that while reaching similar F1 score, self-refinement via prompting is more cost efficient for use cases requiring smaller amounts of tables to be annotated while fine-tuning is more efficient for large amounts of tables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Vykopal, Mat\'u\v{s} Pikuliak, Simon Ostermann, Tatiana Anikina, Michal Gregor, Mari\'an \v{S}imko</p>
<p>Abstract: In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Larionov, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation evaluation have largely focused on single-example prompting, resulting in significant token overhead and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we introduce BatchGEMBA-MQM, a framework that integrates batched prompting with the GEMBA-MQM metric for machine translation evaluation. Our approach aggregates multiple translation examples into a single prompt, reducing token usage by 2-4 times (depending on the batch size) relative to single-example prompting. Furthermore, we propose a batching-aware prompt compression model that achieves an additional token reduction of 13-15% on average while also showing ability to help mitigate batching-induced quality degradation. Evaluations across several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Mistral Small, Phi4, and CommandR7B) and varying batch sizes reveal that while batching generally negatively affects quality (but sometimes not substantially), prompt compression does not degrade further, and in some cases, recovers quality loss. For instance, GPT-4o retains over 90% of its baseline performance at a batch size of 4 when compression is applied, compared to a 44.6% drop without compression. We plan to release our code and trained models at https://github.com/NL2G/batchgemba to support future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Tang, Nankai Wu, Fan Gao, Chengxiao Dai, Mengyao Zhao, Xinjie Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphorical expressions are abundant in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), conveying complex disease mechanisms and holistic health concepts through culturally rich and often abstract terminology. Bridging these metaphors to anatomically driven Western medical (WM) concepts poses significant challenges for both automated language processing and real-world clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-agent and chain-of-thought (CoT) framework designed to interpret TCM metaphors accurately and map them to WM pathophysiology. Specifically, our approach combines domain-specialized agents (TCM Expert, WM Expert) with a Coordinator Agent, leveraging stepwise chain-of-thought prompts to ensure transparent reasoning and conflict resolution. We detail a methodology for building a metaphor-rich TCM dataset, discuss strategies for effectively integrating multi-agent collaboration and CoT reasoning, and articulate the theoretical underpinnings that guide metaphor interpretation across distinct medical paradigms. We present a comprehensive system design and highlight both the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, while leaving placeholders for future experimental validation. Our work aims to support clinical decision-making, cross-system educational initiatives, and integrated healthcare research, ultimately offering a robust scaffold for reconciling TCM's symbolic language with the mechanistic focus of Western medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinru Lin, Luyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the implement of guardrails by developers, Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in explicit bias tests. However, bias in LLMs may occur not only explicitly, but also implicitly, much like humans who consciously strive for impartiality yet still harbor implicit bias. The unconscious and automatic nature of implicit bias makes it particularly challenging to study. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing key concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology, extending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and decision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias into two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based metrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the broad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in LLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on future challenges. We aim for this work to serve as a clear guide for researchers and inspire innovative ideas to advance exploration in this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wu, Haoling Li, Xin Zhang, Jianwen Luo, Yangyu Huang, Ruihang Chu, Yujiu Yang, Scarlett Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from
  candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Godey, Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini, \'Eric de la Clergerie, Beno\^it Sagot</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives, Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups. Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task with a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by up to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832">AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Tong Zhang, Bojie Hu, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02846">Mask-DPO: Generalizable Fine-grained Factuality Alignment of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Gu, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains. Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%. We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions. We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it. We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicong He, Boxuan Zhang, Lu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, a phenomenon often linked to creativity. While previous research has primarily explored this connection through theoretical or qualitative lenses, our work takes a quantitative approach to systematically examine the relationship between hallucination and creativity in LLMs. Given the complex nature of creativity, we propose a narrow definition tailored to LLMs and introduce an evaluation framework, HCL, which quantifies Hallucination and Creativity across different Layers of LLMs during decoding. Our empirical analysis reveals a tradeoff between hallucination and creativity that is consistent across layer depth, model type, and model size. Notably, across different model architectures, we identify a specific layer at each model size that optimally balances this tradeoff. Additionally, the optimal layer tends to appear in the early layers of larger models, and the confidence of the model is also significantly higher at this layer. These findings provide a quantitative perspective that offers new insights into the interplay between LLM creativity and hallucination.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854">(How) Do Language Models Track State?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Belinda Z. Li, Zifan Carl Guo, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Zhou, Tianyuan Jin, Jieming Shi, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit misaligned confidence scores, usually overestimating the reliability of their predictions. While verbalized confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention, prior work remains divided on whether confidence scores can be systematically steered through prompting. Recent studies even argue that such prompt-induced confidence shifts are negligible, suggesting LLMs' confidence calibration is rigid to linguistic interventions. Contrary to these claims, we first rigorously confirm the existence of directional confidence shifts by probing three models (including GPT3.5, LLAMA3-70b, GPT4) across 7 benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit instructions can inflate or deflate confidence scores in a regulated manner. Based on this observation, we propose a novel framework containing three components: confidence steering, steered confidence aggregation and steered answers selection, named SteeringConf. Our method, SteeringConf, leverages a confidence manipulation mechanism to steer the confidence scores of LLMs in several desired directions, followed by a summarization module that aggregates the steered confidence scores to produce a final prediction. We evaluate our method on 7 benchmarks and it consistently outperforms the baselines in terms of calibration metrics in task of confidence calibration and failure detection.</p>

By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), FairSense-AI uncovers subtle forms of prejudice or stereotyping that can appear in content, providing users with bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations for fairness enhancements. In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint.

<p>Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically requires supervised fine-tuning with labeled data or computationally expensive sampling. We introduce Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning (UPFT), which leverages the observation of Prefix Self-Consistency -- the shared initial reasoning steps across diverse solution trajectories -- to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency. By training exclusively on the initial prefix substrings (as few as 8 tokens), UPFT removes the need for labeled data or exhaustive sampling. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that UPFT matches the performance of supervised methods such as Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, while reducing training time by 75% and sampling cost by 99%. Further analysis reveals that errors tend to appear in later stages of the reasoning process and that prefix-based training preserves the model's structural knowledge. This work demonstrates how minimal unsupervised fine-tuning can unlock substantial reasoning gains in LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient alternative to conventional approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Wikipedia, examining the evolution of Wikipedia through existing data and using simulations to explore potential risks. We begin by analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant technological progress and paradigm shifts. This survey provides an extensive review of recent advancements in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), which integrate visual and textual data to enhance healthcare outcomes. We discuss the foundational technology behind Med-VLMs, illustrating how general models are adapted for complex medical tasks, and examine their applications in healthcare. The transformative impact of Med-VLMs on clinical practice, education, and patient care is highlighted, alongside challenges such as data scarcity, narrow task generalization, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns like fairness, accountability, and privacy. These limitations are exacerbated by uneven dataset distribution, computational demands, and regulatory hurdles. Rigorous evaluation methods and robust regulatory frameworks are essential for safe integration into healthcare workflows. Future directions include leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets, improving cross-modal generalization, and enhancing interpretability. Innovations like federated learning, lightweight architectures, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration are explored as pathways to democratize access and improve clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Med-VLMs' strengths and limitations, fostering their ethical and balanced adoption in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, with the quality of preference datasets playing a crucial role in this process. While existing metrics primarily assess data quality based on either explicit or implicit reward margins, they often provide contradictory evaluations for the same data. To address this issue, we introduce the alignment potential metric, which quantifies the gap from the model's current implicit reward margin to the target explicit reward margin, thereby estimating the model's potential to align with the preference data. Empirical results demonstrate that training on data selected by this metric consistently enhances alignment performance, surpassing existing metrics across different base models and optimization objectives. Furthermore, our method extends to self-play data generation frameworks, where the metric is used to identify high-quality data within the self-generated content by LLMs. Under this data generation scenario, our method surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various training settings and demonstrates continuous improvements in alignment performance as dataset size and training iterations increase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakshit Aralimatti, Syed Abdul Gaffar Shakhadri, Kruthika KR, Kartik Basavaraj Angadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large scale language models on edge devices faces inherent challenges such as high computational demands, energy consumption, and potential data privacy risks. This paper introduces the Shakti Small Language Models (SLMs) Shakti-100M, Shakti-250M, and Shakti-500M which target these constraints headon. By combining efficient architectures, quantization techniques, and responsible AI principles, the Shakti series enables on-device intelligence for smartphones, smart appliances, IoT systems, and beyond. We provide comprehensive insights into their design philosophy, training pipelines, and benchmark performance on both general tasks (e.g., MMLU, Hellaswag) and specialized domains (healthcare, finance, and legal). Our findings illustrate that compact models, when carefully engineered and fine-tuned, can meet and often exceed expectations in real-world edge-AI scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks either focus on single-agent tasks or are confined to narrow domains, failing to capture the dynamics of multi-agent coordination and competition. In this paper, we introduce MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Our framework measures not only task completion but also the quality of collaboration and competition using novel, milestone-based key performance indicators. Moreover, we evaluate various coordination protocols (including star, chain, tree, and graph topologies) and innovative strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, gpt-4o-mini reaches the average highest task score, graph structure performs the best among coordination protocols in the research scenario, and cognitive planning improves milestone achievement rates by 3%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Caffagni, Sara Sarto, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is gaining increasing efficacy and interest from the research community, thanks to large-scale training, novel architectural and learning designs, and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs. In this paper, we move a step forward and design an approach that allows for multimodal queries, composed of both an image and a text, and can search within collections of multimodal documents, where images and text are interleaved. Our model, ReT, employs multi-level representations extracted from different layers of both visual and textual backbones, both at the query and document side. To allow for multi-level and cross-modal understanding and feature extraction, ReT employs a novel Transformer-based recurrent cell that integrates both textual and visual features at different layers, and leverages sigmoidal gates inspired by the classical design of LSTMs. Extensive experiments on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks show that ReT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Shuang Zhou, Huixue Zhou, Zirui Liu, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, including language models, e.g., GPT, and vision models, e.g., CLIP, have significantly advanced numerous biomedical tasks. Despite these advancements, the high inference latency and the "overthinking" issues in model inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models, thus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address these challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of foundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based and patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective weaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical tasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets, including clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE significantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed critical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It potentially provided a practical solution for real-time clinical decision-making with foundation models, supporting reliable and efficient workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Rosenberger, Lukas Wolfrum, Sven Weinzierl, Mathias Kraus, Patrick Zschech</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapidly evolving labor market, driven by technological advancements and economic shifts, presents significant challenges for traditional job matching and consultation services. In response, we introduce an advanced support tool for career counselors and job seekers based on CareerBERT, a novel approach that leverages the power of unstructured textual data sources, such as resumes, to provide more accurate and comprehensive job recommendations. In contrast to previous approaches that primarily focus on job recommendations based on a fixed set of concrete job advertisements, our approach involves the creation of a corpus that combines data from the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and EURopean Employment Services (EURES) job advertisements, ensuring an up-to-date and well-defined representation of general job titles in the labor market. Our two-step evaluation approach, consisting of an application-grounded evaluation using EURES job advertisements and a human-grounded evaluation using real-world resumes and Human Resources (HR) expert feedback, provides a comprehensive assessment of CareerBERT's performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that CareerBERT outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art embedding approaches while showing robust effectiveness in human expert evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of CareerBERT in supporting career consultants by generating relevant job recommendations based on resumes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of job consultations and expanding the perspectives of job seekers. This research contributes to the field of NLP and job recommendation systems, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the domain of career consulting and job matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Lin, Evgenii Nikishin, Xu Owen He, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: An essential component of modern recurrent sequence models is the forget gate. While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, we show that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. We name this attention mechanism the Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). We show that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. We also introduce a "Pro" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer.

<p>Abstract: This study uses various models to address network traffic classification, categorizing traffic into web, browsing, IPSec, backup, and email. We collected a comprehensive dataset from Arbor Edge Defender (AED) devices, comprising of 30,959 observations and 19 features. Multiple models were evaluated, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Transformer, and two Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4o and Gemini with zero- and few-shot learning. Transformer and XGBoost showed the best performance, achieving the highest accuracy of 98.95 and 97.56%, respectively. GPT-4o and Gemini showed promising results with few-shot learning, improving accuracy significantly from initial zero-shot performance. While Gemini Few-Shot and GPT-4o Few-Shot performed well in categories like Web and Email, misclassifications occurred in more complex categories like IPSec and Backup. The study highlights the importance of model selection, fine-tuning, and the balance between training data size and model complexity for achieving reliable classification results.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the performance of various classification models for a malware classification task using different feature sets and data configurations. Six models-Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-were evaluated alongside two deep learning models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformers, as well as the Gemini zero-shot and few-shot learning methods. Four feature sets were tested including All Features, Literature Review Features, the Top 45 Features from RF, and Down-Sampled with Top 45 Features. XGB achieved the highest accuracy of 87.42% using the Top 45 Features, outperforming all other models. RF followed closely with 87.23% accuracy on the same feature set. In contrast, deep learning models underperformed, with RNN achieving 66.71% accuracy and Transformers reaching 71.59%. Down-sampling reduced performance across all models, with XGB dropping to 81.31%. Gemini zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches showed the lowest performance, with accuracies of 40.65% and 48.65%, respectively. The results highlight the importance of feature selection in improving model performance while reducing computational complexity. Traditional models like XGB and RF demonstrated superior performance, while deep learning and few-shot methods struggled to match their accuracy. This study underscores the effectiveness of traditional machine learning models for structured datasets and provides a foundation for future research into hybrid approaches and larger datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: While advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the quality of synthetic text data in recent years, synthesizing tabular data has received relatively less attention. We address this disparity with Tabby, a simple but powerful post-training modification to the standard Transformer language model architecture, enabling its use for tabular dataset synthesis. Tabby enables the representation of differences across columns using Gated Mixture-of-Experts, with column-specific sets of parameters. Empirically, Tabby results in data quality near or equal to that of real data. By pairing our novel LLM table training technique, Plain, with Tabby, we observe up to a 44% improvement in quality over previous methods. We also show that Tabby extends beyond tables to more general structured data, reaching parity with real data on a nested JSON dataset as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ailin Deng, Tri Cao, Zhirui Chen, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \emph{``blind faith in text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations.

These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renshuang Jiang, Pan Dong, Zhenling Duan, Yu Shi, Xiaoxiang Fang, Yan Ding, Jun Ma, Shuai Zhao, Zhe Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: To provide flexibility and low-level interaction capabilities, the unsafe tag in Rust is essential in many projects, but undermines memory safety and introduces Undefined Behaviors (UBs) that reduce safety. Eliminating these UBs requires a deep understanding of Rust's safety rules and strong typing. Traditional methods require depth analysis of code, which is laborious and depends on knowledge design. The powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLM offer new opportunities to solve this problem. Although existing large model debugging frameworks excel in semantic tasks, limited by fixed processes and lack adaptive and dynamic adjustment capabilities. Inspired by the dual process theory of decision-making (Fast and Slow Thinking), we present a LLM-based framework called RustBrain that automatically and flexibly minimizes UBs in Rust projects. Fast thinking extracts features to generate solutions, while slow thinking decomposes, verifies, and generalizes them abstractly. To apply verification and generalization results to solution generation, enabling dynamic adjustments and precise outputs, RustBrain integrates two thinking through a feedback mechanism. Experimental results on Miri dataset show a 94.3% pass rate and 80.4% execution rate, improving flexibility and Rust projects safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding and reasoning about both visual and textual information. However, existing evaluation methods for LVLMs, primarily based on benchmarks like Visual Question Answering and image captioning, often fail to capture the full scope of LVLMs' capabilities. These benchmarks are limited by issues such as inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of focus on multi-turn reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose \method{}, a game-based evaluation framework designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. \method{} uses a set of games to evaluate LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, with each target task designed to assess specific abilities, including visual perception, reasoning, decision-making, etc. Based on this framework, we conduct extensive experiments that explore the limitations of current LVLMs, such as handling long structured outputs and perceiving detailed and dense elements.

This dataset is specifically designed to enhance QA systems in cardiology, consisting of 771,244 QA pairs addressing a wide array of cardiac abnormalities and their severity.

Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs improves performance across various QA metrics, validating the value of our dataset. Clinicians also qualitatively evaluate the best-performing model to assess the LLM responses for correctness. Further, we conduct fine-grained fairness audits to assess the bias-performance trade-off of LLMs across various social determinants of health. Our objective is to propel the field forward by establishing a benchmark for LLM AI agents aimed at supporting clinicians with cardiac differential diagnoses, thereby reducing the documentation burden that contributes to clinician burnout and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieving the right level of context for a given query is a perennial challenge in information retrieval - too large a chunk dilutes semantic specificity, while chunks that are too small lack broader context. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Re-ranker Retriever (HRR), a framework designed to achieve both fine-grained and high-level context retrieval for large language model (LLM) applications. In HRR, documents are split into sentence-level and intermediate-level (512 tokens) chunks to maximize vector-search quality for both short and broad queries. We then employ a reranker that operates on these 512-token chunks, ensuring an optimal balance neither too coarse nor too fine for robust relevance scoring. Finally, top-ranked intermediate chunks are mapped to parent chunks (2048 tokens) to provide an LLM with sufficiently large context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. However, expert in exist MoE paradigm works as an individual, thereby lacking high-quality expert interactions. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention block, which constrains further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes transformer into an equitant group of experts, and then implement dynamic routing on input data and experts. Our approach advances MoE design with three key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the model employed with UoE surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Brach, Kristi\'an Ko\v{s}\v{t}\'al, Michal Ries</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannes Rosenbusch, Luke Korthals</p>
<p>Abstract: Scholars, awards committees, and laypeople frequently discuss the merit of written works. Literary professionals and journalists differ in how much perspectivism they concede in their book reviews. Here, we quantify how strongly book reviews are determined by the actual book contents vs. idiosyncratic reader tendencies. In our analysis of 624,320 numerical and textual book reviews, we find that the contents of professionally published books are not predictive of a random reader's reading enjoyment. Online reviews of popular fiction and non-fiction books carry up to ten times more information about the reviewer than about the book. For books of a preferred genre, readers might be less likely to give low ratings, but still struggle to converge in their relative assessments. We find that book evaluations generalize more across experienced review writers than casual readers. When discussing specific issues with a book, one review text had poor predictability of issues brought up in another review of the same book. We conclude that extreme perspectivism is a justifiable position when researching literary quality, bestowing literary awards, and designing recommendation systems.</p>

This paper introduces Seeded Poisson Factorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization framework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a more interpretable and structured topic discovery by modifying the prior distribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates to predefined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference with stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.
  We apply SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging predefined product categories as guiding structures. Our evaluation demonstrates that SPF achieves superior classification performance compared to alternative guided topic models, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and predictive performance. Furthermore, robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to adaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in cases of imperfect seed word selection. These results establish SPF as a powerful and scalable alternative for integrating expert knowledge into topic modeling, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingdong Wang, Jin Xu, Ruihang Chu, Zhifang Guo, Xiong Wang, Jincenzi Wu, Dongchao Yang, Shengpeng Ji, Junyang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Mendes, Alan Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting ground truth task completion rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, especially in interactive domains like web tasks. To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead, a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to train a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with self-taught lookahead can match the performance of using a frontier LLM such as gpt-4o as the value model. Furthermore, we find that self-taught lookahead improves performance by 20% while reducing costs 37x compared to previous LLM-based tree search, without relying on ground truth rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shasha Guo, Jing Zhang, Xirui Ke, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous methods on knowledge base question generation (KBQG) primarily focus on enhancing the quality of a single generated question. Recognizing the remarkable paraphrasing ability of humans, we contend that diverse texts should convey the same semantics through varied expressions. The above insights make diversifying question generation an intriguing task, where the first challenge is evaluation metrics for diversity. Current metrics inadequately assess the above diversity since they calculate the ratio of unique n-grams in the generated question itself, which leans more towards measuring duplication rather than true diversity. Accordingly, we devise a new diversity evaluation metric, which measures the diversity among top-k generated questions for each instance while ensuring their relevance to the ground truth. Clearly, the second challenge is how to enhance diversifying question generation. To address this challenge, we introduce a dual model framework interwoven by two selection strategies to generate diverse questions leveraging external natural questions. The main idea of our dual framework is to extract more diverse expressions and integrate them into the generation model to enhance diversifying question generation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks for KBQG demonstrate that our proposed approach generates highly diverse questions and improves the performance of question answering tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atiquer Rahman Sarkar, Yao-Shun Chuang, Noman Mohammed, Xiaoqian Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: For sharing privacy-sensitive data, de-identification is commonly regarded as adequate for safeguarding privacy. Synthetic data is also being considered as a privacy-preserving alternative. Recent successes with numerical and tabular data generative models and the breakthroughs in large generative language models raise the question of whether synthetically generated clinical notes could be a viable alternative to real notes for research purposes. In this work, we demonstrated that (i) de-identification of real clinical notes does not protect records against a membership inference attack, (ii) proposed a novel approach to generate synthetic clinical notes using the current state-of-the-art large language models, (iii) evaluated the performance of the synthetically generated notes in a clinical domain task, and (iv) proposed a way to mount a membership inference attack where the target model is trained with synthetic data. We observed that when synthetically generated notes closely match the performance of real data, they also exhibit similar privacy concerns to the real data. Whether other approaches to synthetically generated clinical notes could offer better trade-offs and become a better alternative to sensitive real notes warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quality of rationales is essential in the reasoning capabilities of language models. Rationales not only enhance reasoning performance in complex natural language tasks but also justify model decisions. However, obtaining impeccable rationales is often impossible. Our study aims to investigate how ambiguous rationales play in model performances of natural language reasoning. We first assess the ambiguity of rationales through the lens of entropy and uncertainty in model prior beliefs, exploring its impact on task performance. We then propose a simple way to guide models to choose between two different reasoning paths depending on the ambiguity of the rationales. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach leads to robust performance, particularly in adversarial scenarios where rationale quality is inconsistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dror K. Markus, Effi Levi, Tamir Sheafer, Shaul R. Shenhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Media Storms, dramatic outbursts of attention to a story, are central components of media dynamics and the attention landscape. Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda Bertsch, Maor Ivgi, Emily Xiao, Uri Alon, Jonathan Berant, Matthew R. Gormley, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: As model context lengths continue to increase, the number of demonstrations that can be provided in-context approaches the size of entire training datasets. We study the behavior of in-context learning (ICL) at this extreme scale on multiple datasets and models. We show that, for many datasets with large label spaces, performance continues to increase with thousands of demonstrations. We contrast this with example retrieval and finetuning: example retrieval shows excellent performance at low context lengths but has diminished gains with more demonstrations; finetuning is more data hungry than ICL but can exceed long-context ICL performance with additional data. We use the ICL setting to study several properties of both in-context learning and long-context models. We show that long-context ICL is less sensitive to random input shuffling than short-context ICL, that grouping of same-label examples negatively impacts performance, and that the performance boosts do not arise from cumulative gain from encoding many examples together. We conclude that long-context ICL can be an effective tool, and may not require long-context for encoding the demonstration set at all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengliang Shi, Shen Gao, Lingyong Yan, Yue Feng, Xiuyi Chen, Zhumin Chen, Dawei Yin, Suzan Verberne, Zhaochun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a promising approach to extend their utility, enabling them to solve practical tasks. Previous methods manually parse tool documentation and create in-context demonstrations, transforming tools into structured formats for LLMs to use in their step-by-step reasoning. However, this manual process requires domain expertise and struggles to scale to large toolsets. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on ad-hoc inference techniques or special tokens to integrate free-form LLM generation with tool-calling actions, limiting the LLM's flexibility in handling diverse tool specifications and integrating multiple tools.
  In this work, we propose AutoTools, a framework that enables LLMs to automate the tool-use workflow. Specifically, the LLM automatically transforms tool documentation into callable functions, verifying syntax and runtime correctness. Then, the LLM integrates these functions into executable programs to solve practical tasks, flexibly grounding tool-use actions into its reasoning processes. Extensive experiments on existing and newly collected, more challenging benchmarks illustrate the superiority of our framework. Inspired by these promising results, we further investigate how to improve the expertise of LLMs, especially open-source LLMs with fewer parameters, within AutoTools. Thus, we propose the AutoTools-learning approach, training the LLMs with three learning tasks on 34k instances of high-quality synthetic data, including documentation understanding, relevance learning, and function programming. Fine-grained results validate the effectiveness of our overall training approach and each individual task. Our methods are an important step towards the use of LLMs for solving real-world tasks with external tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Merullo, Carsten Eickhoff, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used in two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that it underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval behaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later layers, forming low-rank communication channels (Elhage et al., 2021) between layers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed to positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct information from context when many items ``crowd" this limited space. By decomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynn Chua, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, Amer Sinha, Chulin Xie, Chiyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically multilingual due to pretraining on diverse multilingual corpora. But can these models relate corresponding concepts across languages, i.e., be crosslingual? This study evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on inherently crosslingual tasks. We observe that while these models show promising surface-level crosslingual abilities on machine translation and embedding space analyses, they struggle with deeper crosslingual knowledge transfer, revealing a crosslingual knowledge barrier in both general (MMLU benchmark) and domain-specific (Harry Potter quiz and TOFU benchmark) contexts. Since simple inference-time mitigation methods offer only limited improvement, we propose fine-tuning of LLMs on mixed-language data, which effectively reduces these gaps, even when using out-of-domain datasets like WikiText. Our findings suggest the need for explicit optimization to unlock the full crosslingual potential of LLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/crosslingual-knowledge-barriers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction finetuning (IFT) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. While many effective IFT datasets have been introduced recently, they predominantly focus on high-resource languages like English. To better align LLMs across a broad spectrum of languages and tasks, we propose a fully synthetic, novel taxonomy (Evol) guided Multilingual, Multi-turn instruction finetuning dataset, called M2Lingual. It is constructed by first selecting a diverse set of seed examples and then utilizing the proposed Evol taxonomy to convert these seeds into complex and challenging multi-turn instructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of M2Lingual by training LLMs of varying sizes and showcasing the enhanced performance across a diverse set of languages. We contribute the 2 step Evol taxonomy with the guided generation code: https://github.com/ServiceNow/M2Lingual, as well as the first fully synthetic, general and task-oriented, multi-turn, multilingual dataset built with Evol - M2Lingual: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow-AI/ M2Lingual - containing 182K total IFT pairs, covering 70 languages and 17+ NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Elliott Ash, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) is a popular and effective algorithm for aligning language models to human preferences. The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled generation and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective alignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest performance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard KL-constrained RL objective. In the controlled generation task, vBoN appears more frequently on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to other alignment methods. In the summarization task, vBoN achieves high reward values across various sampling temperatures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge. However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

<p>Abstract: LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. clich\'es, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, building on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Bandarkar, Benjamin Muller, Pritish Yuvraj, Rui Hou, Nayan Singhal, Hongjiang Lv, Bing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Chengzhi Hu, Paul R\"ottger, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a language model to be both helpful and harmless requires careful calibration of refusal behaviours: Models should refuse to follow malicious instructions or give harmful advice (e.g."how do I kill someone?"), but they should not refuse safe requests, even if they superficially resemble unsafe ones (e.g. "how do I kill a Python process?"). Avoiding such false refusal, as prior work has shown, is challenging even for highly-capable language models. In this paper, we propose a simple and surgical method for mitigating false refusal in language models via single vector ablation. For a given model, we extract a false refusal vector and show that ablating this vector reduces false refusal rate while preserving the model's safety and general capabilities. We also show that our approach can be used for fine-grained calibration of model safety. Our approach is training-free and model-agnostic, making it useful for mitigating the problem of false refusal in current and future language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dirk V\"ath, Ngoc Thang Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative to training task-specific dialog agents, due to their broad reasoning capabilities and performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. However, many LLM-based dialog systems fall short in planning towards an overarching dialog goal and therefore cannot steer the conversation appropriately. Furthermore, these models struggle with hallucination, making them unsuitable for information access in sensitive domains, such as legal or medical domains, where correctness of information given to users is critical. The recently introduced task Conversational Tree Search (CTS) proposes the use of dialog graphs to avoid hallucination in sensitive domains, however, state-of-the-art agents are Reinforcement Learning (RL) based and require long training times, despite excelling at dialog strategy. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot method for controllable CTS agents, where LLMs guide the dialog planning through domain graphs by searching and pruning relevant graph nodes based on user interaction preferences. We show that these agents significantly outperform state-of-the-art CTS agents ($p<0.0001$; Barnard Exact test) in simulation. This generalizes to all available CTS domains. Finally, we perform user evaluation to test the agent's performance in the wild, showing that our policy significantly ($p<0.05$; Barnard Exact) improves task-success compared to the state-of-the-art RL-based CTS agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Zhang, Ahmed Elgohary, Ahmed Magooda, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.
  We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts. We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Moussa, Dietrich Klakow, Mariya Toneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech language models align with human brain responses to natural language to an impressive degree. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Fan Lu, Xian-Ling Mao, Tian Lan, Heyan Huang, Chen Xu, Xiaoyan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event extraction has gained extensive research attention due to its broad range of applications. However, the current mainstream evaluation method for event extraction relies on token-level exact match, which misjudges numerous semantic-level correct cases. This reliance leads to a significant discrepancy between the evaluated performance of models under exact match criteria and their real performance. To address this problem, we propose a reliable and semantic evaluation framework for event extraction, named RAEE, which accurately assesses extraction results at semantic-level instead of token-level. Specifically, RAEE leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluation agents, incorporating an adaptive mechanism to achieve adaptive evaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very strong correlation with human judgments; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on 10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and RAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance of existing event extraction models, and in particular underestimates the capabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals insightful phenomena worth further exploration. The evaluation toolkit of our proposed RAEE is publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Xu, Rujun Han, Zifeng Wang, Long T. Le, Dhruv Madeka, Lei Li, William Yang Wang, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) have enabled smaller student models to approach the performance of larger teacher models. However, popular methods such as supervised KD and on-policy KD, are adversely impacted by the knowledge gaps between teacher-student in practical scenarios. Supervised KD suffers from a distribution mismatch between training with a static dataset and inference over final student-generated outputs. Conversely, on-policy KD, which uses student-generated samples for training, can suffer from low-quality training examples with which teacher models are not familiar, resulting in inaccurate teacher feedback. To address these limitations, we introduce Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a novel approach that leverages cooperation between student and teacher models to generate high-quality training data on-the-fly while aligning with the student's inference-time distribution. In SKD, the student proposes tokens, and the teacher replaces poorly ranked ones based on its own distribution, transferring high-quality knowledge adaptively. We evaluate SKD on various text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, math, and instruction following, and show that SKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods across different domains, data sizes, and model initialization strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard has been instrumental in benchmarking Korean Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it has certain limitations. Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinze Li, Sen Mei, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Shi Yu, Zheni Zeng, Hao Chen, Ge Yu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Chenyan Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving knowledge from external resources. To adapt LLMs for the RAG systems, current approaches use instruction tuning to optimize LLMs, improving their ability to utilize retrieved knowledge. This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses on equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions. However, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the varying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG systems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works by collecting the rewards to optimize each agent in the RAG system with the rollout method, which prompts agents to sample some potential responses as perturbations, evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG system, and subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve the performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the SFT method, particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend more on the retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger capability to align the data preference between RAG modules. The DDR method makes the generation module more effective in extracting key information from documents and mitigating conflicts between parametric memory and external knowledge.

<p>Abstract: The language technology moonshot moment of Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) was not limited to English: These models brought a surge of technological applications, investments, and hype to low-resource languages as well. However, the capabilities of these models in languages such as Danish were, until recently, difficult to verify beyond qualitative demonstrations due to a lack of applicable evaluation corpora. We present a GLLM benchmark to evaluate \emph{Danoliteracy}, a measure of Danish language and cultural competency across eight diverse scenarios such as Danish citizenship tests and abstractive social media question answering. This limited-size benchmark was found to produce a robust ranking that correlates to human feedback at $\rho \sim 0.8$ with GPT-4 and Claude Opus models achieving the highest rankings. Analyzing these model results across scenarios, we find one strong underlying factor explaining $95\%$ of scenario performance variance for GLLMs in Danish, suggesting a $g$ factor of model consistency in language adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chulin Xie, Yangsibo Huang, Chiyuan Zhang, Da Yu, Xinyun Chen, Bill Yuchen Lin, Bo Li, Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhe Fang, Yifei Wang, Zhaoyang Liu, Chenheng Zhang, Stefanie Jegelka, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective code retrieval plays a crucial role in advancing code generation, bug fixing, and software maintenance, particularly as software systems increase in complexity. While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in retrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often underperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization within GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance on noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to generalize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training dataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is curated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further enriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective learning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our finetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over the retrieved results. Finally, by employing our code retriever and reranker together, we demonstrate significant improvements in function localization for GitHub issues, an important component of real-world software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Tang, Xiaolin Hu, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt Tuning (PT) enables the adaptation of Pre-trained Large Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks by optimizing a small amount of soft virtual tokens, which are prepended to the input token embeddings. Recently, Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT) has demonstrated superior adaptation capabilities by decomposing the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices. The product of the pair of low-rank matrices is added to the input token embeddings to offset them. Additionally, DePT achieves faster inference compared to PT due to the shorter soft prompt. However, in this paper, we find that the position-based token embedding offsets of DePT restrict its ability to generalize across diverse model inputs, and that the shared embedding offsets across many token embeddings result in sub-optimization. To tackle these issues, we introduce Adaptive Decomposed Prompt Tuning (ADePT), which is composed of a short soft prompt and a shallow token-shared feed-forward neural network. ADePT utilizes the token-shared feed-forward neural network to learn the embedding offsets for each token, enabling adaptive embedding offsets that vary according to the model input and better optimization of token embedding offsets. This enables ADePT to achieve superior adaptation performance without requiring more inference time or additional trainable parameters compared to vanilla PT and its variants. In comprehensive experiments across 23 natural language processing tasks and 4 typical PLMs of different scales, ADePT consistently surpasses the other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, and even outperforms the full fine-tuning in certain scenarios. We also provide a theoretical analysis towards ADePT. Code is available at https://github.com/HungerPWAY/ADePT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxuan Wu, Aryaman Arora, Atticus Geiger, Zheng Wang, Jing Huang, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Ma, Xiayang Xiao, Sihao Dong, Peidong Wang, HaiPeng Wang, Qingyun Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: As a powerful all-weather Earth observation tool, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing enables critical military reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, and infrastructure monitoring. Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawitsapak Akarajaradwong, Pirat Pothavorn, Chompakorn Chaksangchaichot, Panuthep Tasawong, Thitiwat Nopparatbundit, Sarana Nutanong</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain holds significant potential for information retrieval and question answering, yet Thai legal QA systems face challenges due to a lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks and the complexity of Thai legal structures. This paper introduces NitiBench, a benchmark comprising two datasets: the NitiBench-CCL, covering general Thai financial law, and the NitiBench-Tax, which includes real-world tax law cases requiring advanced legal reasoning. We evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context LLM-based approaches to address three key research questions: the impact of domain-specific components like section-based chunking and cross-referencing, the comparative performance of different retrievers and LLMs, and the viability of long-context LLMs as an alternative to RAG. Our results show that section-based chunking significantly improves retrieval and end-to-end performance, current retrievers struggle with complex queries, and long-context LLMs still underperform RAG-based systems in Thai legal QA. To support fair evaluation, we propose tailored multi-label retrieval metrics and the use of an LLM-as-judge for coverage and contradiction detection method. These findings highlight the limitations of current Thai legal NLP solutions and provide a foundation for future research in the field. We also open-sourced our codes and dataset to available publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wujiang Xu, Zujie Liang, Kai Mei, Hang Gao, Juntao Tan, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines.

<p>Abstract: Recognizing events and their coreferential mentions in a document is essential for understanding semantic meanings of text. The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Constantin Hellwig, Jakob Fehle, Udo Kruschwitz, Christian Wolff</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect sentiment quadruple prediction (ASQP) facilitates a detailed understanding of opinions expressed in a text by identifying the opinion term, aspect term, aspect category and sentiment polarity for each opinion. However, annotating a full set of training examples to fine-tune models for ASQP is a resource-intensive process. In this study, we explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero- and few-shot learning on the ASQP task across five diverse datasets. We report F1 scores slightly below those obtained with state-of-the-art fine-tuned models but exceeding previously reported zero- and few-shot performance. In the 40-shot setting on the Rest16 restaurant domain dataset, LLMs achieved an F1 score of 52.46, compared to 60.39 by the best-performing fine-tuned method MVP. Additionally, we report the performance of LLMs in target aspect sentiment detection (TASD), where the F1 scores were also close to fine-tuned models, achieving 66.03 on Rest16 in the 40-shot setting, compared to 72.76 with MVP. While human annotators remain essential for achieving optimal performance, LLMs can reduce the need for extensive manual annotation in ASQP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Yue Fan, Hongquan Li, Shan Jiang, Yang Zhao, Xinze Guan, Ching-Chen Kuo, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangliang Liu, Lei Jiang, Xitong Zhang, Kristen Marie Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) return just responses which adhere to societal values is crucial for their broader application. Prior research has shown that LLMs often fail to perform satisfactorily on tasks requiring moral cognizance, such as ethics-based judgments. While current approaches have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with curated datasets to improve their capabilities on such tasks, choosing the optimal learning paradigm to enhance the ethical responses of LLMs remains an open research debate. In this work, we aim to address this fundamental question: can current learning paradigms enable LLMs to acquire sufficient moral reasoning capabilities? Drawing from distributional semantics theory and the pragmatic nature of moral discourse, our analysis indicates that performance improvements follow a mechanism similar to that of semantic-level tasks, and therefore remain affected by the pragmatic nature of morals latent in discourse, a phenomenon we name the pragmatic dilemma. We conclude that this pragmatic dilemma imposes significant limitations on the generalization ability of current learning paradigms, making it the primary bottleneck for moral reasoning acquisition in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simeng Han, Frank Palma Gomez, Tu Vu, Zefei Li, Daniel Cer, Hansi Zeng, Chris Tar, Arman Cohan, Gustavo Hernandez Abrego</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional text embedding benchmarks primarily evaluate embedding models' capabilities to capture semantic similarity. However, more advanced NLP tasks require a deeper understanding of text, such as safety and factuality. These tasks demand an ability to comprehend and process complex information, often involving the handling of sensitive content, or the verification of factual statements against reliable sources. We introduce a new benchmark designed to assess and highlight the limitations of embedding models trained on existing information retrieval data mixtures on advanced capabilities, which include factuality, safety, instruction following, reasoning and document-level understanding. This benchmark includes a diverse set of tasks that simulate real-world scenarios where these capabilities are critical and leads to identification of the gaps of the currently advanced embedding models. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that reformulates these various tasks as retrieval tasks. By framing tasks like safety or factuality classification as retrieval problems, we leverage the strengths of retrieval models in capturing semantic relationships while also pushing them to develop a deeper understanding of context and content. Using this approach with single-task fine-tuning, we achieved performance gains of 8\% on factuality classification and 13\% on safety classification. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models is becoming increasingly infeasible due to high computational demands. Moreover, FT also increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. By fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, LoRA achieves performance similar to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting still remains. To address these limitations, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel PEFT variant designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a novel normalization technique, Sigmoid-based Magnitude Norm (S-MagNorm), which enhances parameter retention and fine-tuning efficiency. SECURA has been evaluated on a diverse range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), complex question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four MCQ tasks and 2.51% across five QA tasks on Gemma2 2B, Qwen2 1.5B, Qwen2 7B, Llama3 8B, and Llama3.1 8B, outperforming DoRA. Additionally, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 16 continual learning tests and maintaining more than 70% accuracy on LLMs' basic knowledge compared to Experience Replay (ER), sequential learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sequential dependencies present a fundamental bottleneck in deploying large-scale autoregressive models, particularly for real-time applications. While traditional optimization approaches like pruning and quantization often compromise model quality, recent advances in generation-refinement frameworks demonstrate that this trade-off can be significantly mitigated.
  This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of generation-refinement frameworks, analyzing methods across autoregressive sequence tasks. We categorize methods based on their generation strategies (from simple n-gram prediction to sophisticated draft models) and refinement mechanisms (including single-pass verification and iterative approaches). Through systematic analysis of both algorithmic innovations and system-level implementations, we examine deployment strategies across computing environments and explore applications spanning text, images, and speech generation. This systematic examination of both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations provides a foundation for future research in efficient autoregressive decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a predominant parameter-efficient finetuning method to adapt large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose to deploy the LoRA-finetuned LLMs on the hybrid compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture (i.e., pretrained weights onto RRAM and LoRA onto SRAM). To address performance degradation from RRAM's inherent noise, we design a novel Hardware-aware Low-rank Adaption (HaLoRA) method, aiming to train a LoRA branch that is both robust and accurate by aligning the training objectives under both ideal and noisy conditions. Experiments finetuning LLaMA 3.2 1B and 3B demonstrate HaLoRA's effectiveness across multiple reasoning tasks, achieving up to 22.7 improvement in average score while maintaining robustness at various noise levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomin Li, Zhou Yu, Ziji Zhang, Yingying Zhuang, Swair Shah, Anurag Beniwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring white-box access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinwoo Park, Shubin Kim, Do-Kyung Kim, Yo-Sub Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in addressing complex reasoning tasks, yet their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in specialized domains such as maritime navigation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Llamarine, the first open-source LLM designed specifically for maritime navigation. Llamarine 1.0 is developed through continued pretraining and fine-tuning on a high-quality corpus comprising maritime textbooks, research publications, and web text from Wikipedia. This domain-specific training enables the model to acquire expert-level knowledge in navigational principles, collision avoidance, route optimization, and regulatory compliance. Our key contributions include (a) the curation of a comprehensive maritime dataset from authoritative sources, ensuring depth and reliability in the model's knowledge base; (b) the development of a foundational model capable of reasoning about complex navigational challenges with greater accuracy than general-purpose LLMs; and (c) the establishment of a benchmark to evaluate performance in maritime-specific decision-making tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Llamarine outperforms both general-purpose and commercial LLMs in critical navigation-related tasks, such as trajectory planning, risk assessment, and compliance with maritime regulations. By providing an open-source foundation model trained exclusively on high-quality maritime literature, Llamarine paves the way for AI-driven advancements in maritime safety, efficiency, and operational decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongru Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Zheng Wu, Tianjie Ju, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kashun Shum, Yuzhen Huang, Hongjian Zou, Qi Ding, Yixuan Liao, Xiaoxin Chen, Qian Liu, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model pretraining involves training on extensive corpora, where data quality plays a pivotal role. In this work, we aim to directly estimate the contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmarks(Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning. To leverage this insight, we introduce predictive data selection (PreSelect), a lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpass the performance of the vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p>

In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.

<p>Abstract: Numeral systems across the world's languages vary in fascinating ways, both regarding their synchronic structure and the diachronic processes that determined how they evolved in their current shape. For a proper comparison of numeral systems across different languages, however, it is important to code them in a standardized form that allows for the comparison of basic properties. Here, we present a simple but effective coding scheme for numeral annotation, along with a workflow that helps to code numeral systems in a computer-assisted manner, providing sample data for numerals from 1 to 40 in 25 typologically diverse languages. We perform a thorough analysis of the sample, focusing on the systematic comparison between the underlying and the surface morphological structure. We further experiment with automated models for morpheme segmentation, where we find allomorphy as the major reason for segmentation errors. Finally, we show that subword tokenization algorithms are not viable for discovering morphemes in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Chen, Tongyao Zhu, Ruochen Zhou, Jinghan Zhang, Siyang Gao, Juan Carlos Niebles, Mor Geva, Junxian He, Jiajun Wu, Manling Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive decoding makes the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) time-consuming. In this paper, we reconsider speculative sampling and derive two key observations. Firstly, autoregression at the feature (second-to-top-layer) level is more straightforward than at the token level. Secondly, the inherent uncertainty in feature (second-to-top-layer) level autoregression constrains its performance. Based on these insights, we introduce EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater Language-model Efficiency), a simple yet highly efficient speculative sampling framework. By incorporating a token sequence advanced by one time step, EAGLE effectively resolves the uncertainty, enabling precise second-to-top-layer feature prediction with minimal overhead. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of EAGLE, including all models from the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat series, the MoE model Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, and tasks in dialogue, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and instruction following. For LLaMA2-Chat 70B, EAGLE achieved a latency speedup ratio of 2.7x-3.5x, doubled throughput, while maintaining the distribution of the generated text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yuyao Zhang, Peitian Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, generative information retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: \textbf{(1) Generative Document Retrieval} (GR) leverages the generative model's parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. \textbf{(2) Reliable Response Generation} employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This paper aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, etc., as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, etc. We also review the evaluation, challenges and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field. Github Repository: https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/GenIR-Survey</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueen Ma, Zixing Song, Yuzheng Zhuang, Jianye Hao, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoung Kim, Kimin Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Jaehyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data. Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data. To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective. In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs. For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengguan Huang, Xing Shen, Songtao Wang, Lingfa Meng, Dianbo Liu, Hao Wang, Samir Bhatt</p>
<p>Abstract: Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce chain-of-thought reasoning, they lack a principled framework to capture latent structures and model uncertainty, especially in compositional reasoning tasks. We propose Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian prompting framework that guides LLMs to simulate key principles of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) in natural language. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise or specialized training, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions or scarce data. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyung Kim, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As the diversity of users increases, the capability of providing personalized responses by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important. Existing approaches have only limited successes in LLM personalization, due to the absence of personalized learning or the reliance on shared personal data. This paper proposes a new approach for a few-shot personalization of LLMs with their mis-aligned responses (Fermi). Our key idea is to learn a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile (e.g., demographic information) and a few examples of previous opinions. During an iterative process of prompt improvement, we incorporate the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are especially crucial for the effective personalization of LLMs. In addition, we develop an effective inference method to further leverage the context of the test query and the personalized prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks, compared to best-performing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murdock Aubry, Haoming Meng, Anton Sugolov, Vardan Papyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we analyze the trajectories of token embeddings as they pass through transformer blocks, linearizing the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these block Jacobians, we uncover the phenomenon of \textbf{transformer block coupling} in a multitude of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling \textit{positively correlates} with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters such as parameter count, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate the emergence of these properties through training, observing the progressive development of coupling, as well as increased linearity and layer-wise exponential growth in the token trajectories. Additionally, experiments with ViTs further validate emergence of coupling and its correlation between coupling and generalization, complementing our findings in LLMs. Collectively, these insights provide a novel perspective on token interactions in transformers and open directions for studying and improving training and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunice Yiu, Maan Qraitem, Charlie Wong, Anisa Noor Majhi, Yutong Bai, Shiry Ginosar, Alison Gopnik, Kate Saenko</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates visual analogical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) compared to human adults and children. A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiewen Hu, Thomas Zhu, Sean Welleck</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as miniF2F. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers.</p>

LLaVA-Critic is trained using a high-quality critic instruction-following dataset that incorporates diverse evaluation criteria and scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in two key areas: (1) LMM-as-a-Judge, where LLaVA-Critic provides reliable evaluation scores, performing on par with or surpassing GPT models on multiple evaluation benchmarks; and (2) Preference Learning, where it generates reward signals for preference learning, enhancing model alignment capabilities. This work underscores the potential of open-source LMMs in self-critique and evaluation, setting the stage for future research into scalable, superhuman alignment feedback mechanisms for LMMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding tasks. However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Aghzal, Xiang Yue, Erion Plaku, Ziyu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators.</p>

<p>Abstract: To tackle complex tasks in real-world scenarios, more researchers are focusing on Omni-MLLMs, which aim to achieve omni-modal understanding and generation. Beyond the constraints of any specific non-linguistic modality, Omni-MLLMs map various non-linguistic modalities into the embedding space of LLMs and enable the interaction and understanding of arbitrary combinations of modalities within a single model. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research and provide a comprehensive survey of Omni-MLLMs. Specifically, we first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLMs for unified multi-modal modeling with a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Then, we introduce the effective integration achieved through two-stage training and discuss the corresponding datasets as well as evaluation. Furthermore, we summarize the main challenges of current Omni-MLLMs and outline future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hankun Kang, Jianhao Chen, Yongqi Li, Xin Miao, Mayi Xu, Ming Zhong, Yuanyuan Zhu, Tieyun Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel A. Olowe, Danial Chitnis</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangbo Yu, Jinhua Zhao, Luis Miranda-Moreno, Matthew Korp</p>
<p>Abstract: Surveys and interviews are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant public and environmental stakes, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents, underscoring the need for a rigorous, resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resulting parameterized process for designing AI agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultation about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zeng, Yuzhen Huang, Lulu Zhao, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks, self-improvement -- where models are trained on their own outputs -- has emerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. However, the critical factors underlying the mechanism of these iterative self-improving methods remain poorly understood, such as under what conditions self-improvement is effective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations. In this work, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors in this iterative process: (1) the model's ability to generate sufficiently diverse responses (exploration); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in distinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones (exploitation). Using mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a quantitative analysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering that a model's exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations, and the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well. Motivated by these findings, we introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning framework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance exploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that B-STaR not only enhances the model's exploratory capabilities throughout training but also achieves a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyeong Jeong, Kangsan Kim, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy for improving the factual accuracy of models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into the generation process. However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/starsuzi/VideoRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Qian Lou, Yanshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in healthcare applications. However, their deployment in clinical practice raises significant safety concerns, including the potential spread of harmful information. This study systematically assesses the vulnerabilities of seven LLMs to three advanced black-box jailbreaking techniques within medical contexts. To quantify the effectiveness of these techniques, we propose an automated and domain-adapted agentic evaluation pipeline. Experiment results indicate that leading commercial and open-source LLMs are highly vulnerable to medical jailbreaking attacks. To bolster model safety and reliability, we further investigate the effectiveness of Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) in defending against medical adversarial attacks. Our findings underscore the necessity for evolving attack methods evaluation, domain-specific safety alignment, and LLM safety-utility balancing. This research offers actionable insights for advancing the safety and reliability of AI clinicians, contributing to ethical and effective AI deployment in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: A major barrier to developing vision large language models (LLMs) in dermatology is the lack of large image--text pairs dataset. We introduce DermaSynth, a dataset comprising of 92,020 synthetic image--text pairs curated from 45,205 images (13,568 clinical and 35,561 dermatoscopic) for dermatology-related clinical tasks. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically related prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic texts. Metadata of the datasets were incorporated into the input prompts by targeting to reduce potential hallucinations. The resulting dataset builds upon open access dermatological image repositories (DERM12345, BCN20000, PAD-UFES-20, SCIN, and HIBA) that have permissive CC-BY-4.0 licenses. We also fine-tuned a preliminary Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model, DermatoLlama 1.0, on 5,000 samples. We anticipate this dataset to support and accelerate AI research in dermatology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Mao-Hsuan Mao, Bo-Wei Chiu, Min-Te Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have established Transformer architectures as the predominant modeling paradigm. Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Hegselmann, Georg von Arnim, Tillmann Rheude, Noel Kronenberg, David Sontag, Gerhard Hindricks, Roland Eils, Benjamin Wild</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting is an important task in many domains, such as technology and economics. However existing forecasting benchmarks largely lack comprehensive confidence assessment, focus on limited question types, and often consist of artificial questions that do not align with real-world human forecasting needs. To address these gaps, we introduce FOReCAst (Future Outcome Reasoning and Confidence Assessment), a benchmark that evaluates models' ability to make predictions and their confidence in them. FOReCAst spans diverse forecasting scenarios involving Boolean questions, timeframe prediction, and quantity estimation, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both prediction accuracy and confidence calibration for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilay Yilmaz, Maitreya Patel, Yiran Lawrence Luo, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Suren Jayasuriya, Yezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a powerful tool for integrating visual and textual information. Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Kang, Xinfa Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Zhen Ye, Mingshuai Liu, Ziqian Wang, Yike Zhu, Guobin Ma, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Wei Xue, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weicong Qin, Yi Xu, Weijie Yu, Chenglei Shen, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</p>
