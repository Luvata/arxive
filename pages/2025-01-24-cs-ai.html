<p><b>Authors:</b> Jake Chandler, Richard Booth</p>
<p>Abstract: The standard ``serial'' (aka ``singleton'') model of belief contraction models the manner in which an agent's corpus of beliefs responds to the removal of a single item of information. One salient extension of this model introduces the idea of ``parallel'' (aka ``package'' or ``multiple'') change, in which an entire set of items of information are simultaneously removed. Existing research on the latter has largely focussed on single-step parallel contraction: understanding the behaviour of beliefs after a single parallel contraction. It has also focussed on generalisations to the parallel case of serial contraction operations whose characteristic properties are extremely weak. Here we consider how to extend serial contraction operations that obey stronger properties. Potentially more importantly, we also consider the iterated case: the behaviour of beliefs after a sequence of parallel contractions. We propose a general method for extending serial iterated belief change operators to handle parallel change based on an n-ary generalisation of Booth & Chandler's TeamQueue binary order aggregators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francis Rhys Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: I am a person and so are you. Philosophically we sometimes grant personhood to non-human animals, and entities such as sovereign states or corporations can legally be considered persons. But when, if ever, should we ascribe personhood to AI systems? In this paper, we outline necessary conditions for AI personhood, focusing on agency, theory-of-mind, and self-awareness. We discuss evidence from the machine learning literature regarding the extent to which contemporary AI systems, such as language models, satisfy these conditions, finding the evidence surprisingly inconclusive.
  If AI systems can be considered persons, then typical framings of AI alignment may be incomplete. Whereas agency has been discussed at length in the literature, other aspects of personhood have been relatively neglected. AI agents are often assumed to pursue fixed goals, but AI persons may be self-aware enough to reflect on their aims, values, and positions in the world and thereby induce their goals to change. We highlight open research directions to advance the understanding of AI personhood and its relevance to alignment. Finally, we reflect on the ethical considerations surrounding the treatment of AI systems. If AI systems are persons, then seeking control and alignment may be ethically untenable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulan Hu, Sheng Ouyang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Process reward model (PRM) is critical for mathematical reasoning tasks to assign rewards for each intermediate steps. The PRM requires constructing process-wise supervision data for training, which rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) or tree-based methods to construct the reasoning steps, however, the individual reasoning steps may be redundant or containing nuanced errors that difficult to detect. We attribute these to the issue of the overlook of granularity division during process data collection. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, while gathering the process supervision data, we collect the coarse reasoning steps by merging adjacent steps according to preset merging granularity, then we sequentially reduce the merging granularity to collect fine-grained reasoning steps. For each synthesized new step, we relabel according to the label of last step. During training, we also traverse the collected training corpus in a coarse-to-fine manner. We conduct extensive experiments on popular mathematical reasoning datasets across diverse loss criterions, the proposed framework can consistently boost the reasoning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Chevallier, Filip Smola, Richard Schmoetten, Jacques D. Fleuriot</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel formalisation of tensor semantics for linear temporal logic on finite traces (LTLf), with formal proofs of correctness carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate that this formalisation can be integrated into a neurosymbolic learning process by defining and verifying a differentiable loss function for the LTLf constraints, and automatically generating an implementation that integrates with PyTorch. We show that, by using this loss, the process learns to satisfy pre-specified logical constraints. Our approach offers a fully rigorous framework for constrained training, eliminating many of the inherent risks of ad-hoc, manual implementations of logical aspects directly in an "unsafe" programming language such as Python, while retaining efficiency in implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Artale, Anton Gnatenko, Vladislav Ryzhikov, Michael Zakharyaschev</p>
<p>Abstract: Our concern is the data complexity of answering linear monadic datalog queries whose atoms in the rule bodies can be prefixed by operators of linear temporal logic LTL. We first observe that, for data complexity, answering any connected query with operators $\bigcirc/\bigcirc^-$ (at the next/previous moment) is either in AC0, or in $ACC0\!\setminus\!AC0$, or $NC^1$-complete, or LogSpace-hard and in NLogSpace. Then we show that the problem of deciding LogSpace-hardness of answering such queries is PSpace-complete, while checking membership in the classes AC0 and ACC0 as well as $NC^1$-completeness can be done in ExpSpace. Finally, we prove that membership in AC0 or in ACC0, $NC^1$-completeness, and LogSpace-hardness are undecidable for queries with operators $\Diamond_f/\Diamond_p$ (sometime in the future/past) provided that $NC^1 \ne NLogSpace$, and $LogSpace \ne NLogSpace$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Pahde, Thomas Wiegand, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly employed in high-stakes medical applications, despite their tendency for shortcut learning in the presence of spurious correlations, which can have potentially fatal consequences in practice. Detecting and mitigating shortcut behavior is a challenging task that often requires significant labeling efforts from domain experts. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a semi-automated framework for the identification of spurious behavior from both data and model perspective by leveraging insights from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This allows the retrieval of spurious data points and the detection of model circuits that encode the associated prediction rules. Moreover, we demonstrate how these shortcut encodings can be used for XAI-based sample- and pixel-level data annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of our framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13833">On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Santosh Kumar Radha, Oktay Goktas</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate surrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While achieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models exhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological approach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying mechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly impact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in multiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic perturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To analyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model confidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning benchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models, with apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's reasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying mechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models dynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This framework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing applications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions rather than aggregate performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xurui Song, Zhixin Xie, Shuo Huai, Jiayi Kong, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from \textit{jailbreak} attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious content. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to \textit{positive} prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a \textit{happy ending}, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request. This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two steps to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79\% Attack Success Rate on average. We also provide potential quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Ji, Zihui Song, Fucheng Zhong, Jisen Jia, Zhaobo Wu, Zheyi Cao, Tianhao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their impressive abilities in various reasoning and decision-making tasks. However, the quality and coherence of the reasoning process can still benefit from enhanced introspection and self-reflection. In this paper, we introduce Multiplex CoT (Chain of Thought), a method that enables LLMs to simulate a form of self-review while reasoning, by initiating double Chain of Thought (CoT) thinking. Multiplex CoT leverages the power of iterative reasoning, where the model generates an initial chain of thought and subsequently critiques and refines this reasoning with a second round of thought generation. This recursive approach allows for more coherent, logical, and robust answers, improving the overall decision-making process. We demonstrate how this method can be effectively implemented using simple prompt engineering in existing LLM architectures, achieving an effect similar to that of the Learning-Refinement Model (LRM) without the need for additional training. Additionally, we present a practical guide for implementing the method in Google Colab, enabling easy integration into real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ambreesh Parthasarathy, Chandrasekar Subramanian, Ganesh Senrayan, Shreyash Adappanavar, Aparna Taneja, Balaraman Ravindran, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) have been successfully applied to resource allocation problems in a variety of settings, including public health. With the rapid development of powerful large language models (LLMs), they are increasingly used to design reward functions to better match human preferences. Recent work has shown that LLMs can be used to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs using language prompts. However, this has been studied primarily for English prompts and with a focus on task performance only. This can be an issue since grassroots workers, especially in developing countries like India, prefer to work in local languages, some of which are low-resource. Further, given the nature of the problem, biases along population groups unintended by the user are also undesirable. In this work, we study the effects on both task performance and fairness when the DLM algorithm, a recent work on using LLMs to design reward functions for RMABs, is prompted with non-English language commands. Specifically, we run the model on a synthetic environment for various prompts translated into multiple languages. The prompts themselves vary in complexity. Our results show that the LLM-proposed reward functions are significantly better when prompted in English compared to other languages. We also find that the exact phrasing of the prompt impacts task performance. Further, as prompt complexity increases, performance worsens for all languages; however, it is more robust with English prompts than with lower-resource languages. On the fairness side, we find that low-resource languages and more complex prompts are both highly likely to create unfairness along unintended dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Huet, Zied Ben Houidi, Dario Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Episodic memory -- the ability to recall specific events grounded in time and space -- is a cornerstone of human cognition, enabling not only coherent storytelling, but also planning and decision-making. Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) lack a robust mechanism for episodic memory: we argue that integrating episodic memory capabilities into LLM is essential for advancing AI towards human-like cognition, increasing their potential to reason consistently and ground their output in real-world episodic events, hence avoiding confabulations. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework to model and evaluate LLM episodic memory capabilities. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we develop a structured approach to represent episodic events, encapsulating temporal and spatial contexts, involved entities, and detailed descriptions. We synthesize a unique episodic memory benchmark, free from contamination, and release open source code and datasets to assess LLM performance across various recall and episodic reasoning tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4 and Claude variants, Llama 3.1, and o1-mini, reveals that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with episodic memory tasks, particularly when dealing with multiple related events or complex spatio-temporal relationships -- even in contexts as short as 10k-100k tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompts and verifiers in guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) through the space of reasoning. However, most such studies either use a fine-tuned verifier or rely on manually handcrafted few-shot examples. In contrast, in this paper, we focus on LLM-based self-verification of self-generated reasoning steps via COT prompts in a completely zero-shot regime. To explore this setting, we design a new zero-shot prompt, which we call COT STEP, to aid zero-shot decomposition of reasoning steps and design two new zero-shot prompts for LLM-based verifiers. We evaluate the verifiers' ability to classify the correctness of reasoning chains and explore different ways to use verifier scores in guiding reasoning for various mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks with different LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Lang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Common methods for aligning already-capable models with desired behavior rely on the ability of humans to provide supervision. However, future superhuman models will surpass the capability of humans. Therefore, humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models. This expected deficiency of human evaluation would weaken the safety of future AI systems. Scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization are two complementary approaches to tackle this issue. In this paper, we attempt to combine the strengths of these two approaches to further improve alignment. Specifically, we investigate ways of improving human supervision with a strong pretrained model and then supervise the strong model with enhanced weak human supervision. To make iterative empirical progress, we consider an analogy: can we use a strong model to improve weak model supervision and then use it to supervise the strong model? We empirically test it by finetuning a small weak model on ground truth labels with the additional help from a large strong model, and then finetuning the strong model on labels generated by the weak model. We find that debate can assist a weak model in extracting trustworthy information from an untrustworthy strong model, which provides leverage as context on samples when training a weak model. We also show that an ensemble of weak models helps exploit long arguments generated by strong model debaters and obtain a more robust supervision estimate. Extensive experiments on the OpenAI weak-to-strong NLP benchmarks show that the combination approach leads to better alignment, which indicates that debate has the potential to help weak-to-strong generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseop Lee, Suin Kim, Yohan Jo</p>
<p>Abstract: In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemiao Zhang, Liangyu Xu, Feiyu Duan, Yongwei Zhou, Sirui Wang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally utilize a consistent data distribution throughout the entire pretraining process. However, as the model's ability improves, it intuitively should be pretrained with differentiated data. To achieve it, we propose the Perplexity Difference based Preference Curriculum learning (PDPC) framework, which always perceives and uses the data preferred by LLMs to train and boost them. Firstly, we introduce the PD metric to measure the difference in how well strong and weak models fit the samples. Samples with high PD are more challenging for weak models to learn and are more suitable to be arranged in the later stage of pretraining. Secondly, we propose the PD preference function to approximate the model and predict the data preference of the LLM at any time, so as to complete the arrangement of the entire data offline and ensure continuous training without interruption. Experimental results on 1.3B and 3B models demonstrate that our PDPC significantly surpasses baselines. Notably, the 3B model achieved more substantial gains, with an increased average accuracy of over 4.1% across various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Pang, Jinglin He, Noureldin Mohamed Abdelaal Ahmed Mohamed, Changqing Lin, Zhihui Zhang, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-UAV air combat is a complex task involving multiple autonomous UAVs, an evolving field in both aerospace and artificial intelligence. This paper aims to enhance adversarial performance through collaborative strategies. Previous approaches predominantly discretize the action space into predefined actions, limiting UAV maneuverability and complex strategy implementation. Others simplify the problem to 1v1 combat, neglecting the cooperative dynamics among multiple UAVs. To address the high-dimensional challenges inherent in six-degree-of-freedom space and improve cooperation, we propose a hierarchical framework utilizing the Leader-Follower Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LFMAPPO) strategy. Specifically, the framework is structured into three levels. The top level conducts a macro-level assessment of the environment and guides execution policy. The middle level determines the angle of the desired action. The bottom level generates precise action commands for the high-dimensional action space. Moreover, we optimize the state-value functions by assigning distinct roles with the leader-follower strategy to train the top-level policy, followers estimate the leader's utility, promoting effective cooperation among agents. Additionally, the incorporation of a target selector, aligned with the UAVs' posture, assesses the threat level of targets. Finally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wesego</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We only need the encoder at the end to extract representations. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramin Mousa, Meysam Afrookhteh, Hooman Khaloo, Amir Ali Bengari, Gholamreza Heidary</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital currencies have become popular in the last decade due to their non-dependency and decentralized nature. The price of these currencies has seen a lot of fluctuations at times, which has increased the need for prediction. As their most popular, Bitcoin(BTC) has become a research hotspot. The main challenge and trend of digital currencies, especially BTC, is price fluctuations, which require studying the basic price prediction model. This research presents a classification and regression model based on stack deep learning that uses a wavelet to remove noise to predict movements and prices of BTC at different time intervals. The proposed model based on the stacking technique uses models based on deep learning, especially neural networks and transformers, for one, seven, thirty and ninety-day forecasting. Three feature selection models, Chi2, RFE and Embedded, were also applied to the data in the pre-processing stage. The classification model achieved 63\% accuracy for predicting the next day and 64\%, 67\% and 82\% for predicting the seventh, thirty and ninety days, respectively. For daily price forecasting, the percentage error was reduced to 0.58, while the error ranged from 2.72\% to 2.85\% for seven- to ninety-day horizons. These results show that the proposed model performed better than other models in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiongyan Wang, Yutong Xia, Siru ZHong, Weichuang Li, Yuankai Wu, Shifen Cheng, Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring real-time air quality is essential for safeguarding public health and fostering social progress. However, the widespread deployment of air quality monitoring stations is constrained by their significant costs. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{AirRadar}, a deep neural network designed to accurately infer real-time air quality in locations lacking monitoring stations by utilizing data from existing ones. By leveraging learnable mask tokens, AirRadar reconstructs air quality features in unmonitored regions. Specifically, it operates in two stages: first capturing spatial correlations and then adjusting for distribution shifts. We validate AirRadar's efficacy using a year-long dataset from 1,085 monitoring stations across China, demonstrating its superiority over multiple baselines, even with varying degrees of unobserved data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naman Jain, Amir Kalev</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Quantum Feature Extraction (QuFeX), a novel quantum machine learning module. The proposed module enables feature extraction in a reduced-dimensional space, significantly decreasing the number of parallel evaluations required in typical quantum convolutional neural network architectures. Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momen K Tageldeen, Yacine Belgaid, Vivek Mohan, Zhou Wang, Emmanuel M Drakakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI models, coupled with growing demand for edge deployment, necessitates the development of AI hardware that is both high-performance and energy-efficient. In this paper, we propose a novel analog accelerator architecture designed for AI/ML training workloads using stochastic gradient descent with L2 regularization (SGDr). The architecture leverages log-domain circuits in subthreshold MOS and incorporates volatile memory. We establish a mathematical framework for solving SGDr in the continuous time domain and detail the mapping of SGDr learning equations to log-domain circuits. By operating in the analog domain and utilizing weak inversion, the proposed design achieves significant reductions in transistor area and power consumption compared to digital implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that the architecture closely approximates ideal behavior, with a mean square error below 0.87% and precision as low as 8 bits. Furthermore, the architecture supports a wide range of hyperparameters. This work paves the way for energy-efficient analog AI hardware with on-chip training capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alsu Sagirova, Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail Burtsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demonstrates significant progress in solving cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments. One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit prediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this issue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends memory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally broadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange information implicitly and coordinate their actions. We evaluate SRMT on the Partially Observable Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem in a toy Bottleneck navigation task that requires agents to pass through a narrow corridor and on a POGEMA benchmark set of tasks. In the Bottleneck task, SRMT consistently outperforms a variety of reinforcement learning baselines, especially under sparse rewards, and generalizes effectively to longer corridors than those seen during training. On POGEMA maps, including Mazes, Random, and MovingAI, SRMT is competitive with recent MARL, hybrid, and planning-based algorithms. These results suggest that incorporating shared recurrent memory into the transformer-based architectures can enhance coordination in decentralized multi-agent systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Ru Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Centaurus, a class of networks composed of generalized state-space model (SSM) blocks, where the SSM operations can be treated as tensor contractions during training. The optimal order of tensor contractions can then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training efficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the depthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices will take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group convolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the Centaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network size and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during both training and inference. We show that this heterogeneous network design outperforms its homogeneous counterparts in raw audio processing tasks including keyword spotting, speech denoising, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). For ASR, Centaurus is the first network with competitive performance that can be made fully state-space based, without using any nonlinear recurrence (LSTMs), explicit convolutions (CNNs), or (surrogate) attention mechanism.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Toyteller, an AI-powered storytelling system where users generate a mix of story text and visuals by directly manipulating character symbols like they are toy-playing. Anthropomorphized symbol motions can convey rich and nuanced social interactions; Toyteller leverages these motions (1) to let users steer story text generation and (2) as a visual output format that accompanies story text. We enabled motion-steered text generation and text-steered motion generation by mapping motions and text onto a shared semantic space so that large language models and motion generation models can use it as a translational layer. Technical evaluations showed that Toyteller outperforms a competitive baseline, GPT-4o. Our user study identified that toy-playing helps express intentions difficult to verbalize. However, only motions could not express all user intentions, suggesting combining it with other modalities like language. We discuss the design space of toy-playing interactions and implications for technical HCI research on human-AI interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Bai, Christan Earl Grant, Daisy Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented Question Answering (MRAQA), integrating text and images, has gained significant attention in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). Traditional ranking methods rely on small encoder-based language models, which are incompatible with modern decoder-based generative large language models (LLMs) that have advanced various NLP tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose RAMQA, a unified framework combining learning-to-rank methods with generative permutation-enhanced ranking techniques. We first train a pointwise multi-modal ranker using LLaVA as the backbone. Then, we apply instruction tuning to train a LLaMA model for re-ranking the top-k documents using an innovative autoregressive multi-task learning approach. Our generative ranking model generates re-ranked document IDs and specific answers from document candidates in various permutations. Experiments on two MRAQA benchmarks, WebQA and MultiModalQA, show significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshit Achara, Anshuman Chhabra</p>
<p>Abstract: AI Safety Moderation (ASM) classifiers are designed to moderate content on social media platforms and to serve as guardrails that prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from being fine-tuned on unsafe inputs. Owing to their potential for disparate impact, it is crucial to ensure that these classifiers: (1) do not unfairly classify content belonging to users from minority groups as unsafe compared to those from majority groups and (2) that their behavior remains robust and consistent across similar inputs. In this work, we thus examine the fairness and robustness of four widely-used, closed-source ASM classifiers: OpenAI Moderation API, Perspective API, Google Cloud Natural Language (GCNL) API, and Clarifai API. We assess fairness using metrics such as demographic parity and conditional statistical parity, comparing their performance against ASM models and a fair-only baseline. Additionally, we analyze robustness by testing the classifiers' sensitivity to small and natural input perturbations. Our findings reveal potential fairness and robustness gaps, highlighting the need to mitigate these issues in future versions of these models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems into technologies used by young digital citizens raises significant privacy concerns. This study investigates these concerns through a comparative analysis of stakeholder perspectives. A total of 252 participants were surveyed, with the analysis focusing on 110 valid responses from parents/educators and 100 from AI professionals after data cleaning. Quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, examined five validated constructs: Data Ownership and Control, Parental Data Sharing, Perceived Risks and Benefits, Transparency and Trust, and Education and Awareness. Results showed Education and Awareness significantly influenced data ownership and risk assessment, while Data Ownership and Control strongly impacted Transparency and Trust. Transparency and Trust, along with Perceived Risks and Benefits, showed minimal influence on Parental Data Sharing, suggesting other factors may play a larger role. The study underscores the need for user-centric privacy controls, tailored transparency strategies, and targeted educational initiatives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives offers actionable insights into ethical AI design and governance, balancing innovation with robust privacy protections to foster trust in a digital age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mars Liyao Gao, Jan P. Williams, J. Nathan Kutz</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal modeling of real-world data poses a challenging problem due to inherent high dimensionality, measurement noise, and expensive data collection procedures. In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model the temporal sequence of sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatiotemporal field from the latent state space using only a few available sensors. Our proposed algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization; beginning with an arbitrary latent state space, the dynamics of the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, the architecture produces a Koopman-SHRED model which enforces a linear latent space dynamics. We conduct a systematic experimental study including synthetic PDE data, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. With no explicit encoder, SINDy-SHRED and Koopman-SHRED enable efficient training with minimal hyperparameter tuning and laptop-level computing; further, it demonstrates robust generalization in a variety of applications with minimal to no hyperparameter adjustments. Finally, the interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enables accurate long-term video predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming all baseline methods considered, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Park, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems must decide which agent is the most appropriate for a given task. We propose a novel architecture for recommending which LLM agent out of many should perform a task given a natural language prompt by extending the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) encoder model. On test data, we are able to achieve a top-1 accuracy of 92.2% with each classification taking less than 300 milliseconds. In contrast to traditional classification methods, our architecture is computationally cheap, adaptive to new classes, interpretable, and controllable with arbitrary metrics through reinforcement learning. By encoding natural language prompts into sentence embeddings, our model captures the semantic content relevant to recommending an agent. The distance between sentence embeddings that belong to the same agent is then minimized through fine-tuning and aligned to human values through reinforcement learning from human feedback. This allows the classification of natural language prompts based on their nearest neighbors by measuring the cosine similarity between embeddings. This work is made possible through the generation of a synthetic dataset for agent recommendation, which we have open-sourced to the public along with the code for AgentRec recommendation system at https://github.com/joshprk/agentrec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Shan, Jiachen Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Chenxu Zhu, Bo Chen, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem in large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, where LLMs struggle to extract useful information from long user behavior sequences, even within their context limits. To tackle this, we propose ReLLaX (Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models Plus), a framework offering optimization across data, prompt, and parameter levels. At the data level, we introduce Semantic User Behavior Retrieval (SUBR) to reduce sequence heterogeneity, making it easier for LLMs to extract key information. For prompt-level enhancement, we employ Soft Prompt Augmentation (SPA) to inject collaborative knowledge, aligning item representations with recommendation tasks and improving LLMs's exploration of item relationships. Finally, at the parameter level, we propose Component Fully-interactive LoRA (CFLoRA), which enhances LoRA's expressiveness by enabling interactions between its components, allowing better capture of sequential information. Moreover, we present new perspectives to compare current LoRA-based LLM4Rec methods, i.e. from both a composite and a decomposed view. We theoretically demonstrate that the ways they employ LoRA for recommendation are degraded versions of our CFLoRA, with different constraints on atom component interactions. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate ReLLaX's superiority over existing baselines and its ability to mitigate lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyue Long, Can Rong, Huandong Wang, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the extractor-selector (E-S) framework in edge detection (ED) tasks, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. However, this method still falls short of fully exploiting the potential of feature extractors, as selectors only operate on highly compressed feature maps that lack diversity and suffer from substantial information loss. Additionally, while union training can improve perceptual quality, the highest evaluation scores are typically obtained without it, creating a trade-off between quantitative accuracy and perceptual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose an enhanced E-S architecture, which utilizes richer, less-loss feature representations and incorporates auxiliary features during the selection process, thereby improving the effectiveness of the feature selection mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, the Symmetrization Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE), which simultaneously emphasizes both the recall of edge pixels and the suppression of erroneous edge predictions, thereby enhancing the predictions both in the perceptual quality and the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and superiority of our approaches over baseline models, the standard E-S framework, and the standard Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss function are demonstrated by extensive experiments. For example, our enhanced E-S architecture trained with SWBCE loss function achieves average improvements of 8.25$\%$, 8.01$\%$, and 33.25$\%$ in ODS, OIS, and AP, measured on BIPED2 compared with the baseline models, significantly outperforming the standard E-S method. The results set new benchmarks for ED tasks, and highlight the potential of the methods in beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishwash Paneru, Biplov Paneru, Tanka Mukhiya, Khem Narayan Poudyal</p>
<p>Abstract: In Nepal, air pollution is a serious public health concern, especially in cities like Kathmandu where particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) has a major influence on respiratory health and air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is predicted in this work using a Random Forest Regressor, and the model's predictions are interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. With the lowest Testing RMSE (0.23) and flawless R2 scores (1.00), CatBoost performs better than other models, demonstrating its greater accuracy and generalization which is cross validated using a nested cross validation approach. NowCast Concentration and Raw Concentration are the most important elements influencing AQI values, according to SHAP research, which shows that the machine learning results are highly accurate. Their significance as major contributors to air pollution is highlighted by the fact that high values of these characteristics significantly raise the AQI. This study investigates the Hydrogen-Alpha (HA) biodegradable filter as a novel way to reduce the related health hazards. With removal efficiency of more than 98% for PM2.5 and 99.24% for PM10, the HA filter offers exceptional defense against dangerous airborne particles. These devices, which are biodegradable face masks and cigarette filters, address the environmental issues associated with traditional filters' non-biodegradable trash while also lowering exposure to air contaminants.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new challenge that calls for zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems to augment speech data for the downstream task, personalized speech enhancement (PSE), as part of the Generative Data Augmentation workshop at ICASSP 2025. Collecting high-quality personalized data is challenging due to privacy concerns and technical difficulties in recording audio from the test scene. To address these issues, synthetic data generation using generative models has gained significant attention. In this challenge, participants are tasked first with building zero-shot TTS systems to augment personalized data. Subsequently, PSE systems are asked to be trained with this augmented personalized dataset. Through this challenge, we aim to investigate how the quality of augmented data generated by zero-shot TTS models affects PSE model performance. We also provide baseline experiments using open-source zero-shot TTS models to encourage participation and benchmark advancements. Our baseline code implementation and checkpoints are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Qinxun Bai, Yiteng Zhang, Shi Dong, Maria Dimakopoulou, Qi Sun, Zhengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanto Hidayatullah, Nurjannah Syakrani, Muhammad Rizqi Sholahuddin, Trisna Gelar, Refdinal Tubagus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of deep learning-based computer vision, YOLO is revolutionary. With respect to deep learning models, YOLO is also the one that is evolving the most rapidly. Unfortunately, not every YOLO model possesses scholarly publications. Moreover, there exists a YOLO model that lacks a publicly accessible official architectural diagram. Naturally, this engenders challenges, such as complicating the understanding of how the model operates in practice. Furthermore, the review articles that are presently available do not delve into the specifics of each model. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive and in-depth architecture comparison of the four most recent YOLO models, specifically YOLOv8 through YOLO11, thereby enabling readers to quickly grasp not only how each model functions, but also the distinctions between them. To analyze each YOLO version's architecture, we meticulously examined the relevant academic papers, documentation, and scrutinized the source code. The analysis reveals that while each version of YOLO has improvements in architecture and feature extraction, certain blocks remain unchanged. The lack of scholarly publications and official diagrams presents challenges for understanding the model's functionality and future enhancement. Future developers are encouraged to provide these resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamal Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: As the energy landscape changes quickly, grid operators face several challenges, especially when integrating renewable energy sources with the grid. The most important challenge is to balance supply and demand because the solar and wind energy are highly unpredictable. When dealing with such uncertainty, trustworthy short-term load and renewable energy forecasting can help stabilize the grid, maximize energy storage, and guarantee the effective use of renewable resources. Physical models and statistical techniques were the previous approaches employed for this kind of forecasting tasks. In forecasting renewable energy, machine learning and deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated encouraging results. More specifically, the deep learning techniques like CNN and LSTM and the conventional machine learning techniques like regression that are mostly utilized for load and renewable energy forecasting tasks. In this article, we will focus mainly on CNN and LSTM-based forecasting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Tang, Abrar Anwar, Jesse Thomason</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding social signals in multi-party conversations is important for human-robot interaction and artificial social intelligence. Multi-party interactions include social signals like body pose, head pose, speech, and context-specific activities like acquiring and taking bites of food when dining. Incorporating all the multimodal signals in a multi-party interaction is difficult, and past work tends to build task-specific models for predicting social signals. In this work, we address the challenge of predicting multimodal social signals in multi-party settings in a single model. We introduce M3PT, a causal transformer architecture with modality and temporal blockwise attention masking which allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple social cues across multiple participants and their temporal interactions. This approach better captures social dynamics over time by considering longer horizons of social signals between individuals. We train and evaluate our unified model on the Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD), and demonstrate that using multiple modalities improves bite timing and speaking status prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guowei Yin, Sheng Huang, Luwen Huangfu, Yi Zhang, Xiaohong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature quality is paramount for classification performance, particularly in few-shot scenarios. Contrastive learning, a widely adopted technique for enhancing feature quality, leverages sample relations to extract intrinsic features that capture semantic information and has achieved remarkable success in Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Nevertheless, current few-shot contrastive learning approaches often overlook the semantic similarity discrepancies at different granularities when employing the same modeling approach for different sample relations, which limits the potential of few-shot contrastive learning. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective contrastive learning approach, Multi-Grained Relation Contrastive Learning (MGRCL), as a pre-training feature learning model to boost few-shot learning by meticulously modeling sample relations at different granularities. MGRCL categorizes sample relations into three types: intra-sample relation of the same sample under different transformations, intra-class relation of homogenous samples, and inter-class relation of inhomogeneous samples. In MGRCL, we design Transformation Consistency Learning (TCL) to ensure the rigorous semantic consistency of a sample under different transformations by aligning predictions of input pairs. Furthermore, to preserve discriminative information, we employ Class Contrastive Learning (CCL) to ensure that a sample is always closer to its homogenous samples than its inhomogeneous ones, as homogenous samples share similar semantic content while inhomogeneous samples have different semantic content. Our method is assessed across four popular FSL benchmarks, showing that such a simple pre-training feature learning method surpasses a majority of leading FSL methods. Moreover, our method can be incorporated into other FSL methods as the pre-trained model and help them obtain significant performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Gao, Michael W. Spratling</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by decomposing the Softmax operation into a non-linear transformation and the $l_1$-norm. We identify the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. By replacing the non-linear transformation with the Softplus activation function and introducing a dynamic length scale factor for different token lengths based on invariance entropy, we create a novel attention mechanism with performance better than conventional Softmax attention across various inference lengths. To further improve the length extrapolation ability of the proposed attention mechanism, we introduce a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attention weights while diminishing weaker ones, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens. When combined with our proposed attention mechanism, this approach demonstrates significant promise in managing longer sequences, maintaining nearly constant validation loss even at 16$\times$ the training token length while ensuring numerical stability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Ghimire, Dayoung Kil, Seonghwan Jeong, Jaesik Park, Seong-heum Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing structured pruning typically involves multi-stage training procedures that often demand heavy computation. Pruning at initialization, which aims to address this limitation, reduces training costs but struggles with performance. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient framework for one-cycle structured pruning without compromising model performance. In this approach, we integrate pre-training, pruning, and fine-tuning into a single training cycle, referred to as the `one cycle approach'. The core idea is to search for the optimal sub-network during the early stages of network training, guided by norm-based group saliency criteria and structured sparsity regularization. We introduce a novel pruning indicator that determines the stable pruning epoch by assessing the similarity between evolving pruning sub-networks across consecutive training epochs. Also, group sparsity regularization helps to accelerate the pruning process and results in speeding up the entire process. Extensive experiments on datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, using VGGNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and ViT architectures, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being one of the most efficient pruning frameworks in terms of training time. The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Localized Bipartite Match Graph Attention Q-Learning (BMG-Q), a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm framework tailored for ride-pooling order dispatch. BMG-Q advances ride-pooling decision-making process with the localized bipartite match graph underlying the Markov Decision Process, enabling the development of novel Graph Attention Double Deep Q Network (GATDDQN) as the MARL backbone to capture the dynamic interactions among ride-pooling vehicles in fleet. Our approach enriches the state information for each agent with GATDDQN by leveraging a localized bipartite interdependence graph and enables a centralized global coordinator to optimize order matching and agent behavior using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Enhanced by gradient clipping and localized graph sampling, our GATDDQN improves scalability and robustness. Furthermore, the inclusion of a posterior score function in the ILP captures the online exploration-exploitation trade-off and reduces the potential overestimation bias of agents, thereby elevating the quality of the derived solutions. Through extensive experiments and validation, BMG-Q has demonstrated superior performance in both training and operations for thousands of vehicle agents, outperforming benchmark reinforcement learning frameworks by around 10% in accumulative rewards and showing a significant reduction in overestimation bias by over 50%. Additionally, it maintains robustness amidst task variations and fleet size changes, establishing BMG-Q as an effective, scalable, and robust framework for advancing ride-pooling order dispatch operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taoran Fang, Tianhong Gao, Chunping Wang, Yihao Shang, Wei Chow, Lei Chen, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijia Liu, Ancheng Hou, Xiao Yu, Xiang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of Video-LLMs, advancing multimodal learning by bridging video data with language tasks.

Our framework incorporates a parallel system scheduling strategy that enhances processing speed and reduces latency, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications. Furthermore, we introduce StreamBench, a versatile benchmark that evaluates streaming video understanding across diverse media types and interactive scenarios, including multi-turn interactions and complex reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables machine learning models to generalize effectively with minimal labeled data, making it crucial for data-scarce domains such as healthcare, robotics, and natural language processing. Despite its potential, FSL faces challenges including sensitivity to initialization, difficulty in adapting to diverse domains, and vulnerability to noisy datasets. To address these issues, this paper introduces Adaptive Few-Shot Learning (AFSL), a framework that integrates advancements in meta-learning, domain alignment, noise resilience, and multi-modal integration. AFSL consists of four key modules: a Dynamic Stability Module for performance consistency, a Contextual Domain Alignment Module for domain adaptation, a Noise-Adaptive Resilience Module for handling noisy data, and a Multi-Modal Fusion Module for integrating diverse modalities. This work also explores strategies such as task-aware data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, and explainable AI techniques to enhance the applicability and robustness of FSL. AFSL provides scalable, reliable, and impactful solutions for real-world, high-stakes domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent surge of building software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of various testing frameworks, primarily focused on treating prompt templates as the unit of testing. Despite the significant costs associated with test input execution and output assessment, the curation of optimized test suites is yet overlooked in these tools, which calls for tailored test selection or prioritization strategies. In this paper, we show that diversity-based testing techniques, such as Adaptive Random Testing (ART) with appropriate string distance metrics, can be effectively applied to the testing of prompt templates. Our proposed adaptive testing approach adjusts the conventional ART process to this context by selecting new test inputs based on scores derived from existing test suite and their labelling results. Our results, obtained using various implementations that explore several string-based distances, confirm that our approach enables the discovery of failures with reduced testing budgets and promotes the generation of more varied outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding EFX orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou~et~al.~(IJCAI,~2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores admit EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores admit EFX orientations is NP-complete. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by exhibiting a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an EFX orientation of a graph containing only chores if one exists, even if the graph contains self-loops. Remarkably, our first result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods admit EFX orientations of goods was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.~(EC,~2023). In addition, we show the analogous decision problem for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MambaQuant is the first comprehensive PTQ design for the Mamba family, paving the way for further advancements in its application.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of the self-referencing causal cycle (abbreviated RECALL) - a mechanism that enables large language models (LLMs) to bypass the limitations of unidirectional causality, which underlies a phenomenon known as the reversal curse. When an LLM is prompted with sequential data, it often fails to recall preceding context. For example, when we ask an LLM to recall the line preceding "O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave" in the U.S. National Anthem, it often fails to correctly return "Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there" - this is due to the reversal curse. It occurs because language models such as ChatGPT and Llama generate text based on preceding tokens, requiring facts to be learned and reproduced in a consistent token order. While the reversal curse is often viewed as a limitation, we offer evidence of an alternative view: it is not always an obstacle in practice. We find that RECALL is driven by what we designate as cycle tokens - sequences that connect different parts of the training data, enabling recall of preceding tokens from succeeding ones. Through rigorous probabilistic formalization and controlled experiments, we demonstrate how the cycles they induce influence a model's ability to reproduce information. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide our code and experimental details at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/remember-B0B8/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing and reasoning, yet their effectiveness in autonomous planning has been under debate. While existing studies have utilized LLMs with external feedback mechanisms or in controlled environments for planning, these approaches often involve substantial computational and development resources due to the requirement for careful design and iterative backprompting. Moreover, even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 struggle to match human performance on standard planning benchmarks, such as the Blocksworld, without additional support. This paper investigates whether LLMs can independently generate long-horizon plans that rival human baselines. Our novel enhancements to Algorithm-of-Thoughts (AoT), which we dub AoT+, help achieve state-of-the-art results in planning benchmarks out-competing prior methods and human baselines all autonomously.</p>

This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)- based framework for feature selection and model complexity reduction in a model-agnostic manner. Applied to a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) setting, our approach addresses the joint sub-band assignment and power allocation problem in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We propose a novel two-stage systematic explainability framework leveraging feature relevance-oriented XAI to simplify the DRL agents. While the former stage generates a state feature importance ranking of the trained models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based importance scores, the latter stage exploits these importance-based rankings to simplify the state space of the agents by removing the least important features from the model input. Simulation results demonstrate that the XAI-assisted methodology achieves 97% of the original MADRL sum-rate performance while reducing optimal state features by 28%, average training time by 11%, and trainable weight parameters by 46% in a network with eight vehicular pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Kai Wang, Senmao Li, Joost van de Weijer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Shiqi Yang, Yaxing Wang, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Wang, Tianyuan Zhang, Yang Qu, Siyuan Liang, Yuwei Chen, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities; however, these models remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. While existing research has explored white-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box scenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for achieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across driving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD). It first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level reasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring the perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain. Building on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic adaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level risky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current driving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we validate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles powered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the vehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches. Finally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial visual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in this critical domain. Our codes and dataset will be available after paper's acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghun Cho, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented question answering (QA) integrates external information, and thereby increases the QA accuracy of reader models that lack domain knowledge. However, documents retrieved for closed domains require high expertise, so the reader model may have difficulty fully comprehending the text. Moreover, the retrieved documents contain thousands of tokens, some unrelated to the question. As a result, the documents include some inaccurate information, which could lead the reader model to mistrust the passages and could result in hallucinations. To solve these problems, we propose K-COMP (Knowledge-injected compressor) which provides the knowledge required to answer correctly. The compressor automatically generates the requisite prior knowledge to facilitate the answering process prior to the compression of retrieved passages. Subsequently, the passages are compressed autoregressively, with the generated knowledge being integrated into the compression process. This process ensures alignment between the question intent and the compressed context. By augmenting this prior knowledge and concise context, the reader models are guided toward relevant answers and trust the context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Yuxuan (Edison),  Liu, Jinpei Han, Padmanabhan Ramnarayan, A. Aldo Faisal</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical machine learning deployment across institutions faces significant challenges when patient populations and clinical practices differ substantially. We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL prompt strategies based on Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on well-known benchmarks. However, when applied to real-world databases, their performance is significantly less than for these benchmarks, especially for Natural Language (NL) questions requiring complex filters and joins to be processed. This paper then proposes a strategy to compile NL questions into SQL queries that incorporates a dynamic few-shot examples strategy and leverages the services provided by a database keyword search (KwS) platform. The paper details how the precision and recall of the schema-linking process are improved with the help of the examples provided and the keyword-matching service that the KwS platform offers. Then, it shows how the KwS platform can be used to synthesize a view that captures the joins required to process an input NL question and thereby simplify the SQL query compilation step. The paper includes experiments with a real-world relational database to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. The experiments suggest that the strategy achieves an accuracy on the real-world relational database that surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. The paper concludes by discussing the results obtained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhirui Chen, P. N. Karthik, Yeow Meng Chee, Vincent Y. F. Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting with finitely many arms, in which each arm yields an $M$-dimensional vector reward upon selection. We assume that the reward of each dimension (a.k.a. {\em objective}) is generated independently of the others. The best arm of any given objective is the arm with the largest component of mean corresponding to the objective. The end goal is to identify the best arm of {\em every} objective in the shortest (expected) time subject to an upper bound on the probability of error (i.e., fixed-confidence regime). We establish a problem-dependent lower bound on the limiting growth rate of the expected stopping time, in the limit of vanishing error probabilities. This lower bound, we show, is characterised by a max-min optimisation problem that is computationally expensive to solve at each time step. We propose an algorithm that uses the novel idea of {\em surrogate proportions} to sample the arms at each time step, eliminating the need to solve the max-min optimisation problem at each step. We demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In addition, we provide extensive empirical studies to substantiate the efficiency of our algorithm. While existing works on pure exploration with multi-objective multi-armed bandits predominantly focus on {\em Pareto frontier identification}, our work fills the gap in the literature by conducting a formal investigation of the multi-objective best arm identification problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synaptic delay parameterization of neural network models have remained largely unexplored but recent literature has been showing promising results, suggesting the delay parameterized models are simpler, smaller, sparser, and thus more energy efficient than similar performing (e.g. task accuracy) non-delay parameterized ones. We introduce Shared Circular Delay Queue (SCDQ), a novel hardware structure for supporting synaptic delays on digital neuromorphic accelerators. Our analysis and hardware results show that it scales better in terms of memory, than current commonly used approaches, and is more amortizable to algorithm-hardware co-optimizations, where in fact, memory scaling is modulated by model sparsity and not merely network size. Next to memory we also report performance on latency area and energy per inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in complex visual tasks provides valuable insights into their potential and limitations. In this work, we assess the performance of VLMs on the challenging Bongard Openworld Problems benchmark, which involves reasoning over natural images. We propose and evaluate three human-inspired paradigms: holistic analysis (global context processing), deductive rule learning (explicit rule derivation and application), and componential analysis (structured decomposition of images into components). Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o and Gemini, not only surpass human benchmarks but also excel in structured reasoning tasks, with componential analysis proving especially effective. However, ablation studies reveal key challenges, such as handling synthetic images, making fine-grained distinctions, and interpreting nuanced contextual information. These insights underscore the need for further advancements in model robustness and generalization, while highlighting the transformative potential of structured reasoning approaches in enhancing VLM capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shezheng Song, Hao Xu, Jun Ma, Shasha Li, Long Peng, Qian Wan, Xiaodong Liu, Jie Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose language capabilities. However, fine-tuning these models on domain-specific tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model overwrites or loses essential knowledge acquired during pretraining. This phenomenon significantly limits the broader applicability of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compute the element-wise importance of model parameters crucial for preserving general knowledge during fine-tuning. Our method utilizes a dual-objective optimization strategy: (1) regularization loss to retain the parameter crucial for general knowledge; (2) cross-entropy loss to adapt to domain-specific tasks. Additionally, we introduce layer-wise coefficients to account for the varying contributions of different layers, dynamically balancing the dual-objective optimization. Extensive experiments on scientific, medical, and physical tasks using GPT-J and LLaMA-3 demonstrate that our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing model adaptability. Compared to previous methods, our solution is approximately 20 times faster and requires only 10%-15% of the storage, highlighting the practical efficiency. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Abad Rocamora, Grigorios G. Chrysos, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Text classifiers suffer from small perturbations, that if chosen adversarially, can dramatically change the output of the model. Verification methods can provide robustness certificates against such adversarial perturbations, by computing a sound lower bound on the robust accuracy. Nevertheless, existing verification methods incur in prohibitive costs and cannot practically handle Levenshtein distance constraints. We propose the first method for computing the Lipschitz constant of convolutional classifiers with respect to the Levenshtein distance. We use these Lipschitz constant estimates for training 1-Lipschitz classifiers. This enables computing the certified radius of a classifier in a single forward pass. Our method, LipsLev, is able to obtain $38.80$% and $13.93$% verified accuracy at distance $1$ and $2$ respectively in the AG-News dataset, while being $4$ orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. We believe our work can open the door to more efficient verification in the text domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush K. Varshney, Konstantinos Vandikas, Vicen\c{c} Torra</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Within the scope of privacy preservation, information privacy regulations such as GDPR entitle users to request the removal (or unlearning) of their contribution from a service that is hosting the model. For this purpose, a server hosting an ML model must be able to unlearn certain information in cases such as copyright infringement or security issues that can make the model vulnerable or impact the performance of a service based on that model. While most unlearning approaches in FL focus on Horizontal FL (HFL), where clients share the feature space and the global model, Vertical FL (VFL) has received less attention from the research community. VFL involves clients (passive parties) sharing the sample space among them while not having access to the labels. In this paper, we explore unlearning in VFL from three perspectives: unlearning clients, unlearning features, and unlearning samples. To unlearn clients and features we introduce VFU-KD which is based on knowledge distillation (KD) while to unlearn samples, VFU-GA is introduced which is based on gradient ascent. To provide evidence of approximate unlearning, we utilize Membership Inference Attack (MIA) to audit the effectiveness of our unlearning approach. Our experiments across six tabular datasets and two image datasets demonstrate that VFU-KD and VFU-GA achieve performance comparable to or better than both retraining from scratch and the benchmark R2S method in many cases, with improvements of $(0-2\%)$. In the remaining cases, utility scores remain comparable, with a modest utility loss ranging from $1-5\%$. Unlike existing methods, VFU-KD and VFU-GA require no communication between active and passive parties during unlearning. However, they do require the active party to store the previously communicated embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Kothari, Ayush Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare systems continuously generate vast amounts of electronic health records (EHRs), commonly stored in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Despite the wealth of information in these records, their complexity and volume make it difficult for users to retrieve and interpret crucial health insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution, enabling semantic question answering (QA) over medical data, allowing users to interact with their health records more effectively. However, ensuring privacy and compliance requires edge and private deployments of LLMs.
  This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic QA over EHRs by first identifying the most relevant FHIR resources for a user query (Task1) and subsequently answering the query based on these resources (Task2). We explore the performance of privately hosted, fine-tuned LLMs, evaluating them against benchmark models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, while 250x smaller in size, outperform GPT-4 family models by 0.55% in F1 score on Task1 and 42% on Meteor Task in Task2. Additionally, we examine advanced aspects of LLM usage, including sequential fine-tuning, model self-evaluation (narcissistic evaluation), and the impact of training data size on performance.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly broadened the possibilities for editing images of real-world objects. However, performing non-rigid transformations, such as changing the pose of objects or image-based conditioning, remains challenging. Maintaining object identity during these edits is difficult, and current methods often fall short of the precision needed for industrial applications, where consistency is critical. Additionally, fine-tuning diffusion models requires custom training data, which is not always accessible in real-world scenarios. This work introduces FashionRepose, a training-free pipeline for non-rigid pose editing specifically designed for the fashion industry. The approach integrates off-the-shelf models to adjust poses of long-sleeve garments, maintaining identity and branding attributes. FashionRepose uses a zero-shot approach to perform these edits in near real-time, eliminating the need for specialized training. consistent image editing. The solution holds potential for applications in the fashion industry and other fields demanding identity preservation in image editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The event-based Vision-Language Model (VLM) recently has made good progress for practical vision tasks. However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce YOLO11-JDE, a fast and accurate multi-object tracking (MOT) solution that combines real-time object detection with self-supervised Re-Identification (Re-ID). By incorporating a dedicated Re-ID branch into YOLO11s, our model performs Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE), generating appearance features for each detection. The Re-ID branch is trained in a fully self-supervised setting while simultaneously training for detection, eliminating the need for costly identity-labeled datasets. The triplet loss, with hard positive and semi-hard negative mining strategies, is used for learning discriminative embeddings. Data association is enhanced with a custom tracking implementation that successfully integrates motion, appearance, and location cues. YOLO11-JDE achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, surpassing existing JDE methods in terms of FPS and using up to ten times fewer parameters. Thus, making our method a highly attractive solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skin diseases can arise from infections, allergies, genetic factors, autoimmune disorders, hormonal imbalances, or environmental triggers such as sun damage and pollution. Some skin diseases, such as Actinic Keratosis and Psoriasis, can be fatal if not treated in time. Early identification is crucial, but the diagnostic methods for these conditions are often expensive and not widely accessible. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient method for diagnosing skin diseases using deep learning techniques. This approach employs a modified VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model includes several convolutional layers and utilizes ImageNet weights with modified top layers. The top layer is updated with fully connected layers and a final softmax activation layer to classify skin diseases. The dataset used, titled "Skin Disease Dataset," is publicly available. While the VGG16 architecture does not include data augmentation by default, preprocessing techniques such as rotation, shifting, and zooming were applied to augment the data prior to model training. The proposed methodology achieved 90.67% accuracy using the modified VGG16 model, demonstrating its reliability in classifying skin diseases. The promising results highlight the potential of this approach for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The in-situ detection of planetary, lunar, and small-body surface terrain is crucial for autonomous spacecraft applications, where learning-based computer vision methods are increasingly employed to enable intelligence without prior information or human intervention. However, many of these methods remain computationally expensive for spacecraft processors and prevent real-time operation. Training of such algorithms is additionally complex due to the scarcity of labeled data and reliance on supervised learning approaches. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a promising solution by facilitating model training with disparate data sources such as simulations or synthetic scenes, although UDA is difficult to apply to celestial environments where challenging feature spaces are paramount. To alleviate such issues, You Only Crash Once (YOCOv1) has studied the integration of Visual Similarity-based Alignment (VSA) into lightweight one-stage object detection architectures to improve space terrain UDA. Although proven effective, the approach faces notable limitations, including performance degradations in multi-class and high-altitude scenarios. Building upon the foundation of YOCOv1, we propose novel additions to the VSA scheme that enhance terrain detection capabilities under UDA, and our approach is evaluated across both simulated and real-world data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haikuo Du, Fandi Gou, Yunze Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety and scalability are two critical challenges faced by practical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms that rely solely on reward shaping are ineffective in ensuring safety, and their scalability is rather limited due to the fixed-size network output. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Scalable Safe MARL (SS-MARL), to enhance the safety and scalability of MARL methods. Leveraging the inherent graph structure of MAS, we design a multi-layer message passing network to aggregate local observations and communications of varying sizes. Furthermore, we develop a constrained joint policy optimization method in the setting of local observation to improve safety. Simulation experiments demonstrate that SS-MARL achieves a better trade-off between optimality and safety compared to baselines, and its scalability significantly outperforms the latest methods in scenarios with a large number of agents. The feasibility of our method is also verified by hardware implementation with Mecanum-wheeled vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Gong, Wanrui Bian, Zhijie Zhang, Weiguo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Yun, Huilong Ye, Xinru Li, Ruojia Li, Jingfeng Deng, Li Li, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper introduces EICopilot, an novel agent-based solution enhancing search and exploration of enterprise registration data within extensive online knowledge graphs like those detailing legal entities, registered capital, and major shareholders. Traditional methods necessitate text-based queries and manual subgraph explorations, often resulting in time-consuming processes. EICopilot, deployed as a chatbot via Baidu Enterprise Search, improves this landscape by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language queries. This solution automatically generates and executes Gremlin scripts, providing efficient summaries of complex enterprise relationships. Distinct feature a data pre-processing pipeline that compiles and annotates representative queries into a vector database of examples for In-context learning (ICL), a comprehensive reasoning pipeline combining Chain-of-Thought with ICL to enhance Gremlin script generation for knowledge graph search and exploration, and a novel query masking strategy that improves intent recognition for heightened script accuracy. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of EICopilot, including speed and accuracy, over baseline methods, with the \emph{Full Mask} variant achieving a syntax error rate reduction to as low as 10.00% and an execution correctness of up to 82.14%. These components collectively contribute to superior querying capabilities and summarization of intricate datasets, positioning EICopilot as a groundbreaking tool in the exploration and exploitation of large-scale knowledge graphs for enterprise information search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Wang, Toni Lassila, Sharib Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world data, long-tailed data distribution is common, making it challenging for models trained on empirical risk minimisation to learn and classify tail classes effectively. While many studies have sought to improve long tail recognition by altering the data distribution in the feature space and adjusting model decision boundaries, research on the synergy and corrective approach among various methods is limited. Our study delves into three long-tail recognition techniques: Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Rare-Class Sample Generator (RSG), and Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss (LDAM). SCL enhances intra-class clusters based on feature similarity and promotes clear inter-class separability but tends to favour dominant classes only. When RSG is integrated into the model, we observed that the intra-class features further cluster towards the class centre, which demonstrates a synergistic effect together with SCL's principle of enhancing intra-class clustering. RSG generates new tail features and compensates for the tail feature space squeezed by SCL. Similarly, LDAM is known to introduce a larger margin specifically for tail classes; we demonstrate that LDAM further bolsters the model's performance on tail classes when combined with the more explicit decision boundaries achieved by SCL and RSG. Furthermore, SCL can compensate for the dominant class accuracy sacrificed by RSG and LDAM. Our research emphasises the synergy and balance among the three techniques, with each amplifying the strengths of the others and mitigating their shortcomings. Our experiment on long-tailed distribution datasets, using an end-to-end architecture, yields competitive results by enhancing tail class accuracy without compromising dominant class performance, achieving a balanced improvement across all classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng Wang, Ziran Zhou, Junjin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective sentence embeddings that capture semantic nuances and generalize well across diverse contexts are crucial for natural language processing tasks. We address this challenge by applying SimCSE (Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings) using contrastive learning to fine-tune the minBERT model for sentiment analysis, semantic textual similarity (STS), and paraphrase detection. Our contributions include experimenting with three different dropout techniques, namely standard dropout, curriculum dropout, and adaptive dropout, to tackle overfitting, proposing a novel 2-Tier SimCSE Fine-tuning Model that combines both unsupervised and supervised SimCSE on STS task, and exploring transfer learning potential for Paraphrase and SST tasks. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of SimCSE, with the 2-Tier model achieving superior performance on the STS task, with an average test score of 0.742 across all three downstream tasks. The results of error analysis reveals challenges in handling complex sentiments and reliance on lexical overlap for paraphrase detection, highlighting areas for future research. The ablation study revealed that removing Adaptive Dropout in the Single-Task Unsupervised SimCSE Model led to improved performance on the STS task, indicating overfitting due to added parameters. Transfer learning from SimCSE models on Paraphrase and SST tasks did not enhance performance, suggesting limited transferability of knowledge from the STS task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanjangud C. Narendra, Nithin Nagaraj</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning implemented via neural networks, has revolutionized machine learning by providing methods for complex tasks such as object detection/classification and prediction. However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective.
  Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone.
  To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erjia Xiao, Hao Cheng, Jing Shao, Jinhao Duan, Kaidi Xu, Le Yang, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Android malware presents a persistent threat to users' privacy and data integrity. To combat this, researchers have proposed machine learning-based (ML-based) Android malware detection (AMD) systems. However, adversarial Android malware attacks compromise the detection integrity of the ML-based AMD systems, raising significant concerns. Existing defenses against adversarial Android malware provide protections against feature space attacks which generate adversarial feature vectors only, leaving protection against realistic threats from problem space attacks which generate real adversarial malware an open problem. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing ADD, a practical adversarial Android malware defense framework designed as a plug-in to enhance the adversarial robustness of the ML-based AMD systems against problem space attacks. Our extensive evaluation across various ML-based AMD systems demonstrates that ADD is effective against state-of-the-art problem space adversarial Android malware attacks. Additionally, ADD shows the defense effectiveness in enhancing the adversarial robustness of real-world antivirus solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This survey delves into the realm of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) within the context of Foundation Models (FMs). PEFT, a cost-effective fine-tuning technique, minimizes parameters and computational complexity while striving for optimal downstream task performance. FMs, like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and LLaVA specialize in language understanding, generative tasks, and multimodal tasks, trained on diverse datasets spanning text, images, and videos. The diversity of FMs guides various adaptation strategies for PEFT. Therefore, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques applied to diverse FMs and address critical gaps in understanding the techniques, trends, and applications. We start by providing a detailed development of FMs and PEFT. Subsequently, we systematically review the key categories and core mechanisms of PEFT across diverse FMs to offer a comprehensive understanding of trends. We also explore the most recent applications across various FMs to demonstrate the versatility of PEFT, shedding light on the integration of systematic PEFT methods with a range of FMs. Furthermore, we identify potential research and development directions for improving PEFTs in the future.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wu, Yansong Li, Zeyu Dong, Nitya Sathyavageeswaran, Anand D. Sarwate</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying complex machine learning models on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to limited computational power, memory, and model retrainability. To address these limitations, a hybrid system can be established by augmenting the local model with a server-side model, where samples are selectively deferred by a rejector and then sent to the server for processing. The hybrid system enables efficient use of computational resources while minimizing the overhead associated with server usage. The recently proposed Learning to Help (L2H) model trains a server model given a fixed local (client) model, differing from the Learning to Defer (L2D) framework, which trains the client for a fixed (expert) server. In both L2D and L2H, the training includes learning a rejector at the client to determine when to query the server. In this work, we extend the L2H model from binary to multi-class classification problems and demonstrate its applicability in a number of different scenarios of practical interest in which access to the server may be limited by cost, availability, or policy. We derive a stage-switching surrogate loss function that is differentiable, convex, and consistent with the Bayes rule corresponding to the 0-1 loss for the L2H model. Experiments show that our proposed methods offer an efficient and practical solution for multi-class classification in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons. Our research sheds light on the potential use of hallucinations for LLMs and offers new perspectives for future research leveraging LLMs in drug discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The ``space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Felix Stahlberg, Shankar Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at rewriting tasks such as text style transfer and grammatical error correction. While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roel Bouman, Tom Heskes</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoders are frequently used for anomaly detection, both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. They rely on the assumption that when trained using the reconstruction loss, they will be able to reconstruct normal data more accurately than anomalous data. Some recent works have posited that this assumption may not always hold, but little has been done to study the validity of the assumption in theory. In this work we show that this assumption indeed does not hold, and illustrate that anomalies, lying far away from normal data, can be perfectly reconstructed in practice. We revisit the theory of failure of linear autoencoders for anomaly detection by showing how they can perfectly reconstruct out of bounds, or extrapolate undesirably, and note how this can be dangerous in safety critical applications. We connect this to non-linear autoencoders through experiments on both tabular data and real-world image data, the two primary application areas of autoencoders for anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Florea, Xilin Jiang, Nima Mesgarani, Xiaofan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Pix2Cap-COCO, the first panoptic pixel-level caption dataset designed to advance fine-grained visual understanding. To achieve this, we carefully design an automated annotation pipeline that prompts GPT-4V to generate pixel-aligned, instance-specific captions for individual objects within images, enabling models to learn more granular relationships between objects and their contexts. This approach results in 167,254 detailed captions, with an average of 22.94 words per caption. Building on Pix2Cap-COCO, we introduce a novel task, panoptic segmentation-captioning, which challenges models to recognize instances in an image and provide detailed descriptions for each simultaneously. To benchmark this task, we design a robust baseline based on X-Decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that Pix2Cap-COCO is a particularly challenging dataset, as it requires models to excel in both fine-grained visual understanding and detailed language generation. Furthermore, we leverage Pix2Cap-COCO for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on large multimodal models (LMMs) to enhance their performance. For example, training with Pix2Cap-COCO significantly improves the performance of GPT4RoI, yielding gains in CIDEr +1.4%, ROUGE +0.4%, and SPICE +0.5% on Visual Genome dataset, and strengthens its region understanding ability on the ViP-BENCH, with an overall improvement of +5.1%, including notable increases in recognition accuracy +11.2% and language generation quality +22.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Fan, Handong Zhao, Ruiyi Zhang, Yu Shen, Xin Eric Wang, Gang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) action grounding is a critical step in GUI automation that maps language instructions to actionable elements on GUI screens. Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyuan Zhang, Junwei Luo, Xue Yang, Yi Yu, Qingyun Li, Yue Zhou, Xiaosong Jia, Xudong Lu, Jingdong Chen, Xiang Li, Junchi Yan, Yansheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent studies on point-supervised OOD have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets. Across all these datasets, our method achieves an average improvement in accuracy of 3.56% in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li, Xiaohan Wang, Yuhui Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13924">Towards Robust Multimodal Open-set Test-time Adaptation via Adaptive Entropy-aware Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Dong, Eleni Chatzi, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has demonstrated significant potential in addressing distribution shifts between training and testing data. Open-set test-time adaptation (OSTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained model online to an unlabeled target domain that contains unknown classes. This task becomes more challenging when multiple modalities are involved. Existing methods have primarily focused on unimodal OSTTA, often filtering out low-confidence samples without addressing the complexities of multimodal data. In this work, we present Adaptive Entropy-aware Optimization (AEO), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle Multimodal Open-set Test-time Adaptation (MM-OSTTA) for the first time. Our analysis shows that the entropy difference between known and unknown samples in the target domain strongly correlates with MM-OSTTA performance. To leverage this, we propose two key components: Unknown-aware Adaptive Entropy Optimization (UAE) and Adaptive Modality Prediction Discrepancy Optimization (AMP). These components enhance the ability of model to distinguish unknown class samples during online adaptation by amplifying the entropy difference between known and unknown samples. To thoroughly evaluate our proposed methods in the MM-OSTTA setting, we establish a new benchmark derived from existing datasets. This benchmark includes two downstream tasks and incorporates five modalities. Extensive experiments across various domain shift situations demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the AEO framework. Additionally, we highlight the strong performance of AEO in long-term and continual MM-OSTTA settings, both of which are challenging and highly relevant to real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Chengzhuo Tong, Zhizheng Zhao, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guofeng Cui, Pichao Wang, Yang Liu, Zemian Ke, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications requiring accurate and scalable representations across diverse perspectives. Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a fundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating costly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this work, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view generalization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction by processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture forwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative alignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation. These results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view applications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming one of the key technologies of this century. The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with the error backpropagation learning algorithm. However, the ubiquitous adoption of this approach has highlighted some important limitations such as substantial computational cost, difficulty in quantifying uncertainty, lack of robustness, unreliability, and biological implausibility. It is possible that addressing these limitations may require schemes that are inspired and guided by neuroscience theories. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising performance in machine intelligence tasks, exhibiting exciting properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: PC can model information processing in different brain areas, can be used in cognitive control and robotics, and has a solid mathematical grounding in variational inference, offering a powerful inversion scheme for a specific class of continuous-state generative models. With the hope of foregrounding research in this direction, we survey the literature that has contributed to this perspective, highlighting the many ways that PC might play a role in the future of machine learning and computational intelligence at large.</p>

On the computer science side, for a technical point of view of the logic used to craft these algorithms, in the second chapter will be proposed a practical interrogation of Chat-GPT aimed at finding some critical points of the functioning of AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Ledaguenel, C\'eline Hudelot, Mostepha Khouadjia</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. Recently, a family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification based on probabilistic reasoning has gained significant traction. Unfortunately, depending on the language used to represent prior knowledge, solving certain probabilistic reasoning problems can become prohibitively hard when the number of classes increases. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. In this paper, we develop a unified formalism for four probabilistic reasoning problems. Then, we compile several known and new tractability results into a single complexity map of probabilistic reasoning. We build on top of this complexity map to characterize the domains of scalability of several techniques. We hope this work will help neurosymbolic AI practitioners navigate the scalability landscape of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Are biological self-organising systems more `intelligent' than artificial intelligence? If so, why? We frame intelligence as adaptability, and explore this question using a mathematical formalism of causal learning. We compare systems by how they delegate control, illustrating how this applies with examples of computational, biological, human organisational and economic systems. We formally show the scale-free, dynamic, bottom-up architecture of biological self-organisation allows for more efficient adaptation than the static top-down architecture typical of computers, because adaptation can take place at lower levels of abstraction. Artificial intelligence rests on a static, human-engineered `stack'. It only adapts at high levels of abstraction. To put it provocatively, a static computational stack is like an inflexible bureaucracy. Biology is more `intelligent' because it delegates adaptation down the stack. We call this multilayer-causal-learning. It inherits a flaw of biological systems. Cells become cancerous when isolated from the collective informational structure, reverting to primitive transcriptional behaviour. We show states analogous to cancer occur when collectives are too tightly constrained. To adapt to adverse conditions control should be delegated to the greatest extent, like the doctrine of mission-command. Our result shows how to design more robust systems and lays a mathematical foundation for future empirical research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) stands out by utilizing human preferences as a direct reward signal, eliminating the need for intricate reward engineering. However, despite its potential, traditional PbRL methods are often constrained by the indistinguishability of segments, which impedes the learning process. In this paper, we introduce Skill-Enhanced Preference Optimization Algorithm (S-EPOA), which addresses the segment indistinguishability issue by integrating skill mechanisms into the preference learning framework. Specifically, we first conduct the unsupervised pretraining to learn useful skills. Then, we propose a novel query selection mechanism to balance the information gain and distinguishability over the learned skill space. Experimental results on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion, demonstrate that S-EPOA significantly outperforms conventional PbRL methods in terms of both robustness and learning efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of skill-driven learning in overcoming the challenges posed by segment indistinguishability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.</p>

<p>Abstract: The resurgence of autonomous agents built using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks has brought increased focus on LLMs' fundamental ability of tool or function calling. At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyi Wang, Jianheng Liu, Bryan Lee, Zhihao Wu, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating the safety of AI Systems is a pressing concern for organizations deploying them. In addition to the societal damage done by the lack of fairness of those systems, deployers are concerned about the legal repercussions and the reputational damage incurred by the use of models that are unsafe. Safety covers both what a model does; e.g., can it be used to reveal personal information from its training set, and how a model was built; e.g., was it only trained on licensed data sets. Determining the safety of an AI system requires gathering information from a wide set of heterogeneous sources including safety benchmarks and technical documentation for the set of models used in that system. In addition, responsible use is encouraged through mechanisms that advise and help the user to take mitigating actions where safety risks are detected. We present Usage Governance Advisor which creates semi-structured governance information, identifies and prioritizes risks according to the intended use case, recommends appropriate benchmarks and risk assessments and importantly proposes mitigation strategies and actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Singh, Akash Shetty, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems facilitate smooth interaction with databases by translating natural language queries into Structured Query Language (SQL), bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex database management systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components, advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness. By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atin Sakkeer Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA), a novel framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex, multi-step data analytics tasks. ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Seungyoon Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuc Nguyen, Miao Li, Alexandra Morgan, Rima Arnaout, Ramy Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models hold great potential, but only if one can trust the evaluation of the data they generate. We show that many commonly used quality scores for comparing two-dimensional distributions of synthetic vs. ground-truth data give better results than they should, a phenomenon we call the "grade inflation problem." We show that the correlation score, Jaccard score, earth-mover's score, and Kullback-Leibler (relative-entropy) score all suffer grade inflation. We propose that any score that values all datapoints equally, as these do, will also exhibit grade inflation; we refer to such scores as "equipoint" scores. We introduce the concept of "equidensity" scores, and present the Eden score, to our knowledge the first example of such a score. We found that Eden avoids grade inflation and agrees better with human perception of goodness-of-fit than the equipoint scores above. We propose that any reasonable equidensity score will avoid grade inflation. We identify a connection between equidensity scores and R\'enyi entropy of negative order. We conclude that equidensity scores are likely to outperform equipoint scores for generative models, and for comparing low-dimensional distributions more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyi Chen, Leilei Zhang, Guansong Pang, Roger Zimmermann, Shuiguang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philhoon Oh, Jinwoo Shin, James Thorne</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) underscore the necessity of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage external information. However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-V3, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Deutel, Georgios Kontes, Christopher Mutschler, J\"urgen Teich</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on microcontrollers (TinyML) is a common trend to process the increasing amount of sensor data generated at the edge, but in practice, resource and latency constraints make it difficult to find optimal DNN candidates. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an excellent approach to automate this search and can easily be combined with DNN compression techniques commonly used in TinyML. However, many NAS techniques are not only computationally expensive, especially hyperparameter optimization (HPO), but also often focus on optimizing only a single objective, e.g., maximizing accuracy, without considering additional objectives such as memory requirements or computational complexity of a DNN, which are key to making deployment at the edge feasible. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS strategy for TinyML based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBOpt) and an ensemble of competing parametric policies trained using Augmented Random Search (ARS) reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our methodology aims at efficiently finding tradeoffs between a DNN's predictive accuracy, memory requirements on a given target system, and computational complexity. Our experiments show that we consistently outperform existing MOBOpt approaches on different datasets and architectures such as ResNet-18 and MobileNetV3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Majellaro, Jonathan Collu, Aske Plaat, Thomas M. Moerland</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting structured representations from raw visual data is an important and long-standing challenge in machine learning. Recently, techniques for unsupervised learning of object-centric representations have raised growing interest. In this context, enhancing the robustness of the latent features can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training of downstream tasks. A promising step in this direction is to disentangle the factors that cause variation in the data. Previously, Invariant Slot Attention disentangled position, scale, and orientation from the remaining features. Extending this approach, we focus on separating the shape and texture components. In particular, we propose a novel architecture that biases object-centric models toward disentangling shape and texture components into two non-overlapping subsets of the latent space dimensions. These subsets are known a priori, hence before the training process. Experiments on a range of object-centric benchmarks reveal that our approach achieves the desired disentanglement while also numerically improving baseline performance in most cases. In addition, we show that our method can generate novel textures for a specific object or transfer textures between objects with distinct shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Plaut, Hanlin Zhu, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors. This approach is problematic when some mistakes are \emph{catastrophic}, i.e., irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe that round and try to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe) while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We first show that in general, any algorithm either constantly queries the mentor or is nearly guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon grows. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein research is crucial in various fundamental disciplines, but understanding their intricate structure-function relationships remains challenging. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in comprehending task-specific knowledge, suggesting the potential for ChatGPT-like systems specialized in protein to facilitate basic research. In this work, we introduce ProtChatGPT, which aims at learning and understanding protein structures via natural languages. ProtChatGPT enables users to upload proteins, ask questions, and engage in interactive conversations to produce comprehensive answers. The system comprises protein encoders, a Protein-Language Pertaining Transformer (PLP-former), a projection adapter, and an LLM. The protein first undergoes protein encoders and PLP-former to produce protein embeddings, which are then projected by the adapter to conform with the LLM. The LLM finally combines user questions with projected embeddings to generate informative answers. Experiments show that ProtChatGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions. We hope that ProtChatGPT could form the basis for further exploration and application in protein research. Code and our pre-trained model will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbang Dai, Yuncheng Hua, Tongtong Wu, Yang Sheng, Qiu Ji, Guilin Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: When we integrate factual knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) into large language models (LLMs) to enhance their performance, the cost of injection through training increases with the scale of the models. Consequently, there is significant interest in developing prompt strategies that effectively incorporate KG information into LLMs. However, the community has not yet comprehensively understood how LLMs process and interpret KG information in different input formats and organizations within prompts, and researchers often rely on trial and error. To address this gap, we design extensive experiments to empirically study LLMs' comprehension of different KG prompts. At the literal level, we reveal LLMs' preferences for various input formats (from linearized triples to fluent natural language text). At the attention distribution level, we discuss the underlying mechanisms driving these preferences. We then investigate how the organization of structured knowledge impacts LLMs and evaluate LLMs' robustness in processing and utilizing KG information in practical scenarios. Our experiments show that (1) linearized triples are more effective than fluent NL text in helping LLMs understand KG information and answer fact-intensive questions; (2) Different LLMs exhibit varying preferences for different organizational formats of triples; (3) LLMs with larger scales are more susceptible to noisy, incomplete subgraphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Futa Waseda, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training often suffers from a robustness-accuracy trade-off, where achieving high robustness comes at the cost of accuracy. One approach to mitigate this trade-off is leveraging invariance regularization, which encourages model invariance under adversarial perturbations; however, it still leads to accuracy loss. In this work, we closely analyze the challenges of using invariance regularization in adversarial training and understand how to address them. Our analysis identifies two key issues: (1) a ``gradient conflict" between invariance and classification objectives, leading to suboptimal convergence, and (2) the mixture distribution problem arising from diverged distributions between clean and adversarial inputs. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric Representation-regularized Adversarial Training (ARAT), which incorporates asymmetric invariance loss with stop-gradient operation and a predictor to avoid gradient conflict, and a split-BatchNorm (BN) structure to resolve the mixture distribution problem. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that each component effectively addresses the identified issues, offering novel insights into adversarial defense. ARAT shows superiority over existing methods across various settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings to knowledge distillation-based defenses, providing a new perspective on their relative successes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is an important step in making language models useful for direct user interaction. However, the legal domain is underrepresented in typical instruction datasets (e.g., only 10 out of 1600+ tasks in Super-NaturalInstructions). To study whether instruction tuning on legal datasets is necessary for strong legal reasoning, we aggregate 58 annotated legal datasets and write instructions for each, creating LawInstruct. LawInstruct covers 17 global jurisdictions, 24 languages and a total of 12M examples across diverse tasks such as legal QA, summarization of court cases, and legal argument mining. We evaluate our models on LegalBench, measuring legal reasoning across five categories in 162 challenging and realistic legal tasks, and MMLU, to measure potential drops in general reasoning capabilities. We find that legal-specific instruction tuning on Flan-T5 - yielding FLawN-T5 - improves performance on LegalBench across all model sizes, with an aggregate increase of 15 points or 50% over Flan-T5 for the base size. No model size shows performance drops in MMLU. We publish LawInstruct as a resource for further study of instruction tuning in the legal domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Zhang, Dongxia Wang, Zhu Sun, Yanhui Li, Youcheng Sun, Huizhi Liang, Wenhai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to provide personalized recommendations to users. Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely introduced in RSs to improve recommendation accuracy. In this study, however, we demonstrate that RSs do not necessarily perform worse even if the KG is downgraded to the user-item interaction graph only (or removed). We propose an evaluation framework KG4RecEval to systematically evaluate how much a KG contributes to the recommendation accuracy of a KG-based RS, using our defined metric KGER (KG utilization efficiency in recommendation). We consider the scenarios where knowledge in a KG gets completely removed, randomly distorted and decreased, and also where recommendations are for cold-start users. Our extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets and a number of state-of-the-art KG-based RSs reveal that: to remove, randomly distort or decrease knowledge does not necessarily decrease recommendation accuracy, even for cold-start users. These findings inspire us to rethink how to better utilize knowledge from existing KGs, whereby we discuss and provide insights into what characteristics of datasets and KG-based RSs may help improve KG utilization efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to an agent's capability to learn from a continuous stream of data and transfer knowledge without forgetting old information. One crucial aspect of CL is forward transfer, i.e., improved and faster learning on a new task by leveraging information from prior knowledge. While this ability comes naturally to biological brains, it poses a significant challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we suggest that environmental enrichment (EE) can be used as a biological model for studying forward transfer, inspiring human-like AI development. EE refers to animal studies that enhance cognitive, social, motor, and sensory stimulation and is a model for what, in humans, is referred to as 'cognitive reserve'. Enriched animals show significant improvement in learning speed and performance on new tasks, typically exhibiting forward transfer. We explore anatomical, molecular, and neuronal changes post-EE and discuss how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to predict neural computation changes after enriched experiences. Finally, we provide a synergistic way of combining neuroscience and AI research that paves the path toward developing AI capable of rapid and efficient new task learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing strategies for managing risks from advanced AI systems often focus on affecting what AI systems are developed and how they diffuse. However, this approach becomes less feasible as the number of developers of advanced AI grows, and impedes beneficial use-cases as well as harmful ones. In response, we urge a complementary approach: increasing societal adaptation to advanced AI, that is, reducing the expected negative impacts from a given level of diffusion of a given AI capability. We introduce a conceptual framework which helps identify adaptive interventions that avoid, defend against and remedy potentially harmful uses of AI systems, illustrated with examples in election manipulation, cyberterrorism, and loss of control to AI decision-makers. We discuss a three-step cycle that society can implement to adapt to AI. Increasing society's ability to implement this cycle builds its resilience to advanced AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Gao, Guanhua Ye, Tong Chen, Wentao Zhang, Junliang Yu, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sudesh Ramesh Bhagat, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a robust ensemble model with the state-of-the-art ONE-PEACE Large Language Model (LLM) for accurate detection of sidewalks. Accurate sidewalk detection is crucial in improving road safety and urban planning. The study evaluated the model's performance on Cityscapes, Ade20k, and the Boston Dataset. The results showed that the ensemble model performed better than the individual models, achieving mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU) scores of 93.1\%, 90.3\%, and 90.6\% on these datasets under ideal conditions. Additionally, the ensemble model maintained a consistent level of performance even in challenging conditions such as Salt-and-Pepper and Speckle noise, with only a gradual decrease in efficiency observed. On the other hand, the ONE-PEACE LLM performed slightly better than the ensemble model in ideal scenarios but experienced a significant decline in performance under noisy conditions. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the ensemble model, making it a valuable asset for improving urban infrastructure related to road safety and curb space management. This study contributes positively to the broader context of urban health and mobility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Kim, Byungkun Lee, Hojoon Lee, Dongyoon Hwang, Donghu Kim, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery is a learning paradigm that aims to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit rewards. However, it faces challenges in learning complex behaviors and often leads to learning unsafe or undesirable behaviors. For instance, in various continuous control tasks, current unsupervised skill discovery methods succeed in learning basic locomotions like standing but struggle with learning more complex movements such as walking and running. Moreover, they may acquire unsafe behaviors like tripping and rolling or navigate to undesirable locations such as pitfalls or hazardous areas. In response, we present DoDont (Do's and Don'ts), an instruction-based skill discovery algorithm composed of two stages. First, in an instruction learning stage, DoDont leverages action-free instruction videos to train an instruction network to distinguish desirable transitions from undesirable ones. Then, in the skill learning stage, the instruction network adjusts the reward function of the skill discovery algorithm to weight the desired behaviors. Specifically, we integrate the instruction network into a distance-maximizing skill discovery algorithm, where the instruction network serves as the distance function. Empirically, with less than 8 instruction videos, DoDont effectively learns desirable behaviors and avoids undesirable ones across complex continuous control tasks.

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages. Additionally, many low-resource languages (\eg African languages) are often evaluated only on basic text classification tasks due to the lack of appropriate or comprehensive benchmarks outside of high-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for 17 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference~(AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning~(AfriMGSM), and multi-choice knowledge-based question answering~(AfriMMLU). We use IrokoBench to evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and translate-test settings~(where test sets are translated into English) across 10 open and six proprietary LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between high-resource languages~(such as English and French) and low-resource African languages. We observe a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with the highest performing open model, Gemma 2 27B only at 63\% of the best-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. In addition, machine translating the test set to English before evaluation helped to close the gap for larger models that are English-centric, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. These findings suggest that more efforts are needed to develop and adapt LLMs for African languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Shen, Yue Li, Desong Meng, Dongqi Cai, Sheng Qi, Li Zhang, Mengwei Xu, Yun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with application programming interfaces (APIs) have gained significant interest in both academia and industry. Recent work demonstrates that these API-based agents exhibit relatively strong autonomy and planning capabilities. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ShortcutsBench}, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving real-world complex tasks. \textsc{ShortcutsBench} includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc., refined user queries, human-annotated high-quality action sequences, detailed parameter filling values, and parameters requesting necessary input from the system or user. We revealed how existing benchmarks~/~datasets struggle to accommodate the advanced reasoning capabilities of existing more intelligent LLMs. Moreover, our extensive evaluation of agents built with $5$ leading open-source (size $\geq$ 57B) and $5$ closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini) with varying intelligence level reveals significant limitations of existing API-based agents in the whole process of handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary input from the system and the user. These findings highlight the great challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Liu, Xiaosen Zheng, Niklas Muennighoff, Guangtao Zeng, Longxu Dou, Tianyu Pang, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix trains many small models on diverse data mixtures, uses regression to predict performance of unseen mixtures, and applies the best predicted mixture to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens to fit the regression model and predict the best data mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Furthermore, RegMix consistently outperforms human selection in experiments involving models up to 7B models trained on 100B tokens, while matching or exceeding DoReMi using just 10% of the computational resources. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sundesh Donthi, Maximilian Spencer, Om Patel, Joon Doh, Eid Rodan, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien</p>
<p>Abstract: For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.(LoResLM @ COLING Preprint)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sania Nayab, Giulio Rossolini, Marco Simoni, Andrea Saracino, Giorgio Buttazzo, Nicolamaria Manes, Fabrizio Giacomelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) can solve challenging question-answering tasks, and prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), have gained attention for enhancing the explanation and correctness of outputs. However, many models and techniques tend to produce excessively verbose and lengthy answers, leading to issues with both conciseness and generation time. To address this, this paper analyzes the impact of output lengths on LLM inference pipelines by introducing and proposing novel metrics to evaluate the \textit{correct conciseness} of a model and related prompting techniques. Then, we examine the impact of controlling output length through a refined prompt engineering strategy, Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages the model to produce more concise outputs. To better understand the effects of such a prompt, we also introduce two additional scores for analyzing the conciseness, measured in terms of redundancy and information flow in generated answers. Experiments on pretrained LLMs and multiple datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed metrics and the effectiveness of CCoT across different models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoujin Huang, Guanxiong Luo, Yunlin Zhao, Yilong Liu, Yuwan Wang, Kexin Yang, Jingzhe Liu, Hua Guo, Min Wang, Lingyan Zhang, Mengye Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tory Frame, Julian Padget, George Stothart, Elizabeth Coulthard</p>
<p>Abstract: Human trust is a prerequisite to trustworthy AI adoption, yet trust remains poorly understood. Trust is often described as an attitude, but attitudes cannot be reliably measured or managed. Additionally, humans frequently conflate trust in an AI system, its machine learning (ML) technology, and its other component parts. Without fully understanding the 'leap of faith' involved in trusting ML, users cannot develop intrinsic trust in these systems. A common approach to building trust is to explain a ML model's reasoning process. However, such explanations often fail to resonate with non-experts due to the inherent complexity of ML systems and explanations are disconnected from users' own (unarticulated) mental models. This work puts forward an innovative way of directly building intrinsic trust in ML, by discerning and measuring the Leap of Faith (LoF) taken when a user decides to rely on ML. The LoF matrix captures the alignment between an ML model and a human expert's mental model. This match is rigorously and practically identified by feeding the user's data and objective function into both an ML agent and an expert-validated rules-based agent: a verified point of reference that can be tested a priori against a user's own mental model. This represents a new class of neuro-symbolic architecture. The LoF matrix reveals to the user the distance that constitutes the leap of faith between the rules-based and ML agents. For the first time, we propose trust metrics that evaluate whether users demonstrate trust through their actions rather than self-reported intent and whether such trust is deserved based on outcomes. The significance of the contribution is that it enables empirical assessment and management of ML trust drivers, to support trustworthy ML adoption. The approach is illustrated through a long-term high-stakes field study: a 3-month pilot of a multi-agent sleep-improvement system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model continual learning (CL) has recently attracted significant interest for its ability to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world scenarios without retraining. A major challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL framework for language models, named Knowledge Identification and Fusion (KIF), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. KIF initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter dependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a novel group-wise knowledge identification technique to ascertain the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained knowledge fusion strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, KIF achieves an optimal balance between retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. KIF also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable extensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay techniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving models ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of KIF and its variants across different settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Diao, Baiqi Wu, Ruixuan Zhang, Ajian Liu, Xingxing Wei, Meng Wang, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first \textbf{T}ransfer-based \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{S}keletal \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}ecognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Cheng, Jati H. Husen, Yijun Lu, Teeradaj Racharak, Nobukazu Yoshioka, Naoyasu Ubayashi, Hironori Washizaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Context: Requirements engineering (RE) faces mounting challenges in handling increasingly complex software systems. The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities and challenges in RE. Objective: This systematic literature review aims to analyze and synthesize current research on GenAI applications in RE, focusing on identifying research trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Method: We conducted a comprehensive review of 105 articles published between 2019 and 2024 obtained from major academic databases, using a systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis. Results: Analysis revealed the following. (1) While GPT series models dominate current applications by 67.3% of studies, the existing architectures face technical challenges-interpretability (61.9%), reproducibility (52.4%), and controllability (47.6%), which demonstrate strong correlations (>35% co-occurrence). (2) Reproducibility is identified as a major concern by 52.4% of studies, which highlights challenges in achieving consistent results due to the stochastic nature and parameter sensitivity of GenAI. (3) Governance-related issues (e.g., ethics and security) form a distinct cluster of challenges that requires coordinated solutions, yet they are addressed by less than 20% of studies. Conclusions: While GenAI exhibits potential in RE, our findings reveal critical issues: (1) the high correlations among interpretability, reproducibility, and controllability imply the requirement for more specialized architectures that target interdependencies of these attributes. (2) The widespread concern about result consistency and reproducibility demands standardized evaluation frameworks. (3) The emergence of challenges related to interconnected governance demands comprehensive governance structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eslam Eldeeb, Hirley Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proved to have a promising role in future intelligent wireless networks. Online RL has been adopted for radio resource management (RRM), taking over traditional schemes. However, due to its reliance on online interaction with the environment, its role becomes limited in practical, real-world problems where online interaction is not feasible. In addition, traditional RL stands short in front of the uncertainties and risks in real-world stochastic environments. In this manner, we propose an offline and distributional RL scheme for the RRM problem, enabling offline training using a static dataset without any interaction with the environment and considering the sources of uncertainties using the distributions of the return. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional resource management models. In addition, it is the only scheme that surpasses online RL with a 10 % gain over online RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yeyun Gong, Wen Xiao, Song Wang, Yuji Zhang, Wenjun Hou, Kaishuai Xu, Wenge Liu, Wenjie Li, Jian Jiao, Qi Chen, Peng Cheng, Wayne Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Adachi, Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoki Hamagami</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates test-time adaptation (TTA) for regression, where a regression model pre-trained in a source domain is adapted to an unknown target distribution with unlabeled target data. Although regression is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning, most of the existing TTA methods have classification-specific designs, which assume that models output class-categorical predictions, whereas regression models typically output only single scalar values. To enable TTA for regression, we adopt a feature alignment approach, which aligns the feature distributions between the source and target domains to mitigate the domain gap. However, we found that naive feature alignment employed in existing TTA methods for classification is ineffective or even worse for regression because the features are distributed in a small subspace and many of the raw feature dimensions have little significance to the output. For an effective feature alignment in TTA for regression, we propose Significant-subspace Alignment (SSA). SSA consists of two components: subspace detection and dimension weighting. Subspace detection finds the feature subspace that is representative and significant to the output. Then, the feature alignment is performed in the subspace during TTA. Meanwhile, dimension weighting raises the importance of the dimensions of the feature subspace that have greater significance to the output. We experimentally show that SSA outperforms various baselines on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyun Lee, Yilun Xu, Tomas Geffner, Giulia Fanti, Karsten Kreis, Arash Vahdat, Weili Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from diffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the probability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times64$ datasets show that our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\times$ smaller networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Chan, Anson Leung, James Bergstra</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) aims to obtain a continually improving policy as it interacts with the environment, while ensuring the initial policy behaviour is satisficing. This satisficing behaviour is necessary for robotic manipulation where random exploration can be costly due to catastrophic failures and time. O2O RL is especially compelling when we can only obtain a scarce amount of (potentially suboptimal) demonstrations$\unicode{x2014}$a scenario where behavioural cloning (BC) is known to suffer from distribution shift. Previous works have outlined the challenges in applying O2O RL algorithms under the image-based environments. In this work, we propose a novel O2O RL algorithm that can learn in a real-life image-based robotic vacuum grasping task with a small number of demonstrations where BC fails majority of the time. The proposed algorithm replaces the target network in off-policy actor-critic algorithms with a regularization technique inspired by neural tangent kernel. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach above 90\% success rate in under two hours of interaction time, with only 50 human demonstrations, while BC and existing commonly-used RL algorithms fail to achieve similar performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Zhang, Fali Wang, Xiaomin Li, Zongyu Wu, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Qi He, Wenpeng Yin, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. However, LLMs may also acquire unwanted behaviors from the diverse and sensitive nature of their training data, which can include copyrighted and private content. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. Despite the effectiveness of current unlearning methods, little attention has been given to whether existing unlearning methods for LLMs truly achieve forgetting or merely hide the knowledge, which current unlearning benchmarks fail to detect. This paper reveals that applying quantization to models that have undergone unlearning can restore the "forgotten" information. To thoroughly evaluate this phenomenon, we conduct comprehensive experiments using various quantization techniques across multiple precision levels. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization. ...

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is shown to largely benefit from precise reward models (RMs). However, recent studies in reward modeling schemes are skewed towards English, limiting the applicability of RLHF in multilingual alignments. In this work, we investigate the cross-lingual transfer of RMs trained in diverse languages, primarily from English. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong cross-lingual transfer of English RMs, exceeding target language RMs by 3~4% average increase in Multilingual RewardBench. Furthermore, we analyze the cross-lingual transfer of RMs through the representation shifts. Finally, we perform multilingual alignment to exemplify how cross-lingual transfer in RM propagates to enhanced multilingual instruction-following capability, along with extensive analyses on off-the-shelf RMs. We release the code, model, and data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyan Zhao, Yiming Wang, Yuyang Chen, Yan Li, Leong Hou U, Xiaoguang Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Experience replay is widely used to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by leveraging past experiences. However, existing experience replay methods, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, often suffer from low efficiency, particularly in real-world scenarios with high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay (EDER). EDER employs a deterministic point process to model the diversity between samples and prioritizes replay based on the diversity between samples. To further enhance learning efficiency, we incorporate Cholesky decomposition for handling large state spaces in realistic environments. Additionally, rejection sampling is applied to select samples with higher diversity, thereby improving overall learning efficacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on robotic manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic indoor environments in Habitat. The results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also achieves superior performance in high-dimensional, realistic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huzaifa Pardawala, Siddhant Sukhani, Agam Shah, Veer Kejriwal, Abhishek Pillai, Rohan Bhasin, Andrew DiBiasio, Tarun Mandapati, Dhruv Adha, Sudheer Chava</p>
<p>Abstract: Fact-checking is extensively studied in the context of misinformation and disinformation, addressing objective inaccuracies. However, a softer form of misinformation involves responses that are factually correct but lack certain features such as clarity and relevance. This challenge is prevalent in formal Question-Answer (QA) settings such as press conferences in finance, politics, sports, and other domains, where subjective answers can obscure transparency. Despite this, there is a lack of manually annotated datasets for subjective features across multiple dimensions. To address this gap, we introduce SubjECTive-QA, a human annotated dataset on Earnings Call Transcripts' (ECTs) QA sessions as the answers given by company representatives are often open to subjective interpretations and scrutiny. The dataset includes 49,446 annotations for long-form QA pairs across six features: Assertive, Cautious, Optimistic, Specific, Clear, and Relevant. These features are carefully selected to encompass the key attributes that reflect the tone of the answers provided during QA sessions across different domain. Our findings are that the best-performing Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), RoBERTa-base, has similar weighted F1 scores to Llama-3-70b-Chat on features with lower subjectivity, such as Relevant and Clear, with a mean difference of 2.17% in their weighted F1 scores. The models perform significantly better on features with higher subjectivity, such as Specific and Assertive, with a mean difference of 10.01% in their weighted F1 scores. Furthermore, testing SubjECTive-QA's generalizability using QAs from White House Press Briefings and Gaggles yields an average weighted F1 score of 65.97% using our best models for each feature, demonstrating broader applicability beyond the financial domain.

<p>Abstract: While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D 1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D 1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianlong Wang, Hewen Pan, Hangtao Zhang, Minghui Li, Shengshan Hu, Ziqi Zhou, Lulu Xue, Peijin Guo, Yichen Wang, Wei Wan, Aishan Liu, Leo Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic manipulation in the physical world is increasingly empowered by \textit{large language models} (LLMs) and \textit{vision-language models} (VLMs), leveraging their understanding and perception capabilities. Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link \url{https://trojanrobot.github.io}.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bethia Sun, Maurice Pagnucco, Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the inception of the classicalist vs. connectionist debate, it has been argued that the ability to systematically combine symbol-like entities into compositional representations is crucial for human intelligence. In connectionist systems, the field of disentanglement has gained prominence for its ability to produce explicitly compositional representations; however, it relies on a fundamentally symbolic, concatenative representation of compositional structure that clashes with the continuous, distributed foundations of deep learning. To resolve this tension, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and introduce Soft TPR, a representational form that encodes compositional structure in an inherently distributed, flexible manner, along with Soft TPR Autoencoder, a theoretically-principled architecture designed specifically to learn Soft TPRs. Comprehensive evaluations in the visual representation learning domain demonstrate that the Soft TPR framework consistently outperforms conventional disentanglement alternatives -- achieving state-of-the-art disentanglement, boosting representation learner convergence, and delivering superior sample efficiency and low-sample regime performance in downstream tasks. These findings highlight the promise of a distributed and flexible approach to representing compositional structure by potentially enhancing alignment with the core principles of deep learning over the conventional symbolic approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joohyung Lee, Jungchan Cho, Wonjun Lee, Mohamed Seif, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: To alleviate the training burden in federated learning while enhancing convergence speed, Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising approach by combining the advantages of federated and split learning. However, recent studies have largely overlooked competitive situations. In this framework, the SFL model owner can choose the cut layer to balance the training load between the server and clients, ensuring the necessary level of privacy for the clients. Additionally, the SFL model owner sets incentives to encourage client participation in the SFL process. The optimization strategies employed by the SFL model owner influence clients' decisions regarding the amount of data they contribute, taking into account the shared incentives over clients and anticipated energy consumption during SFL. To address this framework, we model the problem using a hierarchical decision-making approach, formulated as a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among clients and analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium by examining the leader's game. Furthermore, we discuss privacy concerns related to differential privacy and the criteria for selecting the minimum required cut layer. Our findings show that the Stackelberg equilibrium solution maximizes the utility for both the clients and the SFL model owner.</p>

<p>Abstract: The real estate market relies heavily on structured data, such as property details, market trends, and price fluctuations. However, the lack of specialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the development of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we introduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question Answering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762 question-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property information, real estate company finance information and land auction information. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA poses greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures, open-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we propose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with spoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves the performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA and SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering research in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in open-domain and long-table question-answering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxin Liu, Xiang Gao, Yisha Li, Xin Li, Haiyang Lu, Ben Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement, thus improving dwelling time and improving user retention. In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to inject at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream injection policy for accurate live stream allocation. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, and these issues may cause too many live stream allocations, which interrupts the user's short-video interest and leads to a decrease in the user's app usage duration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live-stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laypeople -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-speech techniques rely on voice cloning to simulate ground-truth speech from paired whispers. However, the simulated speech often lacks intelligibility and fails to generalize well across different speakers. To address this issue, we focus on learning phoneme-level alignments from paired whispers and text and employ a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to simulate the ground-truth. To reduce dependence on whispers, we learn phoneme alignments directly from NAMs, though the quality is constrained by the available training data. To further mitigate reliance on NAM/whisper data for ground-truth simulation, we propose incorporating the lip modality to infer speech and introduce a novel diffusion-based method that leverages recent advancements in lip-to-speech technology. Additionally, we release the MultiNAM dataset with over 7.96 hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers and benchmark all methods on this dataset.

<p>Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zephan M. Enciso, Boyang Cheng, Likai Pei, Jianbo Liu, Steven Davis, Michael Niemier, Ningyuan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is an indispensable capability for AI-enabled, safety-critical applications, e.g. autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) use Bayesian statistics to provide both classification predictions and uncertainty estimation, but they suffer from high computational overhead associated with random number generation and repeated sample iterations. Furthermore, BNNs are not immediately amenable to acceleration through compute-in-memory architectures due to the frequent memory writes necessary after each RNG operation. To address these challenges, we present an ASIC that integrates 360 fJ/Sample Gaussian RNG directly into the SRAM memory words. This integration reduces RNG overhead and enables fully-parallel compute-in-memory operations for BNNs. The prototype chip achieves 5.12 GSa/s RNG throughput and 102 GOp/s neural network throughput while occupying 0.45 mm2, bringing AI uncertainty estimation to edge computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Luo, Zhuofan Zheng, Yifan Wang, Yiyao Yu, Xinzhe Ni, Zicheng Lin, Jin Zeng, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is widely used to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks. Training URSA-8B further on the DualMath-1.1M dataset yields URSA-RM-8B, a verifier that enhances URSA-8B's test-time performance and surpasses strong closed-source multimodal MLLMs like GPT-4o.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Guo, Cheng Gong, Xi Lin, Fei Liu, Zhichao Lu, Qingfu Zhang, Zhenkun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Crafting adversarial examples is crucial for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presenting a challenge equivalent to maximizing a non-differentiable 0-1 loss function.
  However, existing single objective methods, namely adversarial attacks focus on a surrogate loss function, do not fully harness the benefits of engaging multiple loss functions, as a result of insufficient understanding of their synergistic and conflicting nature.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multi-Objective Set-based Attack (MOS Attack), a novel adversarial attack framework leveraging multiple loss functions and automatically uncovering their interrelations.
  The MOS Attack adopts a set-based multi-objective optimization strategy, enabling the incorporation of numerous loss functions without additional parameters.
  It also automatically mines synergistic patterns among various losses, facilitating the generation of potent adversarial attacks with fewer objectives.
  Extensive experiments have shown that our MOS Attack outperforms single-objective attacks. Furthermore, by harnessing the identified synergistic patterns, MOS Attack continues to show superior results with a reduced number of loss functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyun Li, Yushi Chen, Xinya Shu, Dong Chen, Xin He, Yi Yu, Xue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal language models (MLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer are considered powerful candidates for unifying various domains and tasks. MLMs developed for remote sensing (RS) have demonstrated outstanding performance in multiple tasks, such as visual question answering and visual grounding. In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects corresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects of multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS foundation models. However, aerial detection has not been explored by existing RS MLMs because the autoregressive prediction mechanism of MLMs differs significantly from the detection outputs. In this paper, we present a simple baseline for applying MLMs to aerial detection for the first time, named LMMRotate. Specifically, we first introduce a normalization method to transform detection outputs into textual outputs to be compatible with the MLM framework. Then, we propose a evaluation method, which ensures a fair comparison between MLMs and conventional object detection models. We construct the baseline by fine-tuning open-source general-purpose MLMs and achieve impressive detection performance comparable to conventional detector. We hope that this baseline will serve as a reference for future MLM development, enabling more comprehensive capabilities for understanding RS images.

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11478">Each Graph is a New Language: Graph Learning with LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huachi Zhou, Jiahe Du, Chuang Zhou, Chang Yang, Yilin Xiao, Yuxuan Xie, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graph structures in node classification tasks. These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes.
  Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11592">Training-free Ultra Small Model for Universal Sparse Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqing Tang, Huanze Zhuang, Guiyun Tian, Zhenli Zeng, Yi Ding, Wenzhong Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large models attract widespread attention in recent years, but they face challenges in applications that require high interpretability or have limited resources, such as physical sensing, medical imaging, and bioinformatics. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a well-proved theory that drives many recent breakthroughs in these applications. However, as a typical under-determined linear system, CS suffers from excessively long sparse reconstruction times when using traditional iterative methods, particularly with large-scale data. Current AI methods like deep unfolding fail to substitute them because pre-trained models exhibit poor generality beyond their training conditions and dataset distributions, or lack interpretability. Instead of following the big model fervor, this paper proposes ultra-small artificial neural models called coefficients learning (CL), enabling training-free and rapid sparse reconstruction while perfectly inheriting the generality and interpretability of traditional iterative methods, bringing new feature of incorporating prior knowledges. In CL, a signal of length $n$ only needs a minimal of $n$ trainable parameters. A case study model called CLOMP is implemented for evaluation. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Compared to representative iterative methods, CLOMP improves efficiency by 100 to 1000 folds for large-scale data. Test results on eight diverse image datasets indicate that CLOMP improves structural similarity index by 292%, 98%, 45% for sampling rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, respectively. We believe this method can truly usher CS reconstruction into the AI era, benefiting countless under-determined linear systems that rely on sparse solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatriz Souza, Michael Pradel</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to execute code is a prerequisite for various dynamic program analyses. Learning-guided execution has been proposed as an approach to enable the execution of arbitrary code snippets by letting a neural model predict likely values for any missing variables. Although state-of-the-art learning-guided execution approaches, such as LExecutor, can enable the execution of a relative high amount of code, they are limited to predicting a restricted set of possible values and do not use any feedback from previous executions to execute even more code. This paper presents Treefix, a novel learning-guided execution approach that leverages LLMs to iteratively create code prefixes that enable the execution of a given code snippet. The approach addresses the problem in a multi-step fashion, where each step uses feedback about the code snippet and its execution to instruct an LLM to improve a previously generated prefix. This process iteratively creates a tree of prefixes, a subset of which is returned to the user as prefixes that maximize the number of executed lines in the code snippet. In our experiments with two datasets of Python code snippets, Treefix achieves 25% and 7% more coverage relative to the current state of the art in learning-guided execution, covering a total of 84% and 82% of all lines in the code snippets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Andres Medina Florez, Shaina Raza, Rashida Lynn, Zahra Shakeri, Brendan T. Smith, Elham Dolatabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.
  Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emir Ceyani, Han Xie, Baturalp Buyukates, Carl Yang, Salman Avestimehr</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are crucial for modeling relational and biological data. As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myunsoo Kim, Hayeong Lee, Seong-Woong Shim, JunHo Seo, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent agents are able to make decisions based on different levels of granularity and duration. Recent advances in skill learning enabled the agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by effectively guiding the agent in choosing appropriate skills. However, the practice of using fixed-length skills can easily result in skipping valuable decision points, which ultimately limits the potential for further exploration and faster policy learning. In this work, we propose to learn a simple and effective termination condition that identifies decision points through a state-action novelty module that leverages agent experience data. Our approach, Novelty-based Decision Point Identification (NBDI), outperforms previous baselines in complex, long-horizon tasks, and remains effective even in the presence of significant variations in the environment configurations of downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of decision point identification in skill learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Wang, Xin Ye, Feng Tao, Chenbin Pan, Abhirup Mallik, Burhaneddin Yaman, Liu Ren, Junshan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kayvon Mazooji, Ilan Shomorony</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</p>
