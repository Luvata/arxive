<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Sun, Qing Tong, Wenshuang Yang, Wenqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Typically, the significant efficiency can be achieved by deploying different edge AI models in various real world scenarios while a few large models manage those edge AI models remotely from cloud servers. However, customizing edge AI models for each user's specific application or extending current models to new application scenarios remains a challenge. Inappropriate local training or fine tuning of edge AI models by users can lead to model malfunction, potentially resulting in legal issues for the manufacturer. To address aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an innovative framework called "DiReD", which involves knowledge DIstillation & REverse DIstillation. In the initial step, an edge AI model is trained with presumed data and a KD process using the cloud AI model in the upper management cloud server. This edge AI model is then dispatched to edge AI devices solely for inference in the user's application scenario. When the user needs to update the edge AI model to better fit the actual scenario, the reverse distillation (RD) process is employed to extract the knowledge: the difference between user preferences and the manufacturer's presumptions from the edge AI model using the user's exclusive data. Only the extracted knowledge is reported back to the upper management cloud server to update the cloud AI model, thus protecting user privacy by not using any exclusive data. The updated cloud AI can then update the edge AI model with the extended knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed "DiReDi" framework allows the manufacturer to update the user model by learning new knowledge from the user's actual scenario with private data. The initial redundant knowledge is reduced since the retraining emphasizes user private data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08372">FedProphet: Memory-Efficient Federated Adversarial Training via Theoretic-Robustness and Low-Inconsistency Cascade Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minxue Tang, Yitu Wang, Jingyang Zhang, Louis DiValentin, Aolin Ding, Amin Hass, Yiran Chen, Hai "Helen" Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a strong privacy guarantee by enabling local training across edge devices without training data sharing, and Federated Adversarial Training (FAT) further enhances the robustness against adversarial examples, promoting a step toward trustworthy artificial intelligence. However, FAT requires a large model to preserve high accuracy while achieving strong robustness, and it is impractically slow when directly training with memory-constrained edge devices due to the memory-swapping latency. Moreover, existing memory-efficient FL methods suffer from poor accuracy and weak robustness in FAT because of inconsistent local and global models, i.e., objective inconsistency.
  In this paper, we propose FedProphet, a novel FAT framework that can achieve memory efficiency, adversarial robustness, and objective consistency simultaneously. FedProphet partitions the large model into small cascaded modules such that the memory-constrained devices can conduct adversarial training module-by-module. A strong convexity regularization is derived to theoretically guarantee the robustness of the whole model, and we show that the strong robustness implies low objective inconsistency in FedProphet. We also develop a training coordinator on the server of FL, with Adaptive Perturbation Adjustment for utility-robustness balance and Differentiated Module Assignment for objective inconsistency mitigation. FedProphet empirically shows a significant improvement in both accuracy and robustness compared to previous memory-efficient methods, achieving almost the same performance of end-to-end FAT with 80% memory reduction and up to 10.8x speedup in training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Lecha, Andrea Cavallo, Francesca Dominici, Elvin Isufi, Claudio Battiloro</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological Deep Learning (TDL) has emerged as a paradigm to process and learn from signals defined on higher-order combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes. Although many complex systems have an asymmetric relational structure, most TDL models forcibly symmetrize these relationships. In this paper, we first introduce a novel notion of higher-order directionality and we then design Directed Simplicial Neural Networks (Dir-SNNs) based on it. Dir-SNNs are message-passing networks operating on directed simplicial complexes able to leverage directed and possibly asymmetric interactions among the simplices. To our knowledge, this is the first TDL model using a notion of higher-order directionality. We theoretically and empirically prove that Dir-SNNs are more expressive than their directed graph counterpart in distinguishing isomorphic directed graphs. Experiments on a synthetic source localization task demonstrate that Dir-SNNs outperform undirected SNNs when the underlying complex is directed, and perform comparably when the underlying complex is undirected.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Ji Zhang, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been shown a promising direction for aligning generative models with human intent and has also been explored in recent works for alignment of diffusion generative models. In this work, we provide a rigorous treatment by formulating the task of fine-tuning diffusion models, with reward functions learned from human feedback, as an exploratory continuous-time stochastic control problem. Our key idea lies in treating the score-matching functions as controls/actions, and upon this, we develop a unified framework from a continuous-time perspective, to employ reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in terms of improving the generation quality of diffusion models. We also develop the corresponding continuous-time RL theory for policy optimization and regularization under assumptions of stochastic different equations driven environment. Experiments on the text-to-image (T2I) generation will be reported in the accompanied paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Ibrahim, Heraldo Rozas, Nagi Gebraeel</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass classification for settings where data features $\mathbf{x}$ and their labels $\mathbf{y}$ are uncertain. We identify that distributionally robust one-vs-all (OVA) classifiers often struggle in settings with imbalanced data. To address this issue, we use Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization to develop a robust version of the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) characterized by the Crammer-Singer (CS) loss. First, we prove that the CS loss is bounded from above by a Lipschitz continuous function for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}$, then we exploit strong duality results to express the dual of the worst-case risk problem, and we show that the worst-case risk minimization problem admits a tractable convex reformulation due to the regularity of the CS loss. Moreover, we develop a kernel version of our proposed model to account for nonlinear class separation, and we show that it admits a tractable convex upper bound. We also propose a projected subgradient method algorithm for a special case of our proposed linear model to improve scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the art OVA models in settings where the training data is highly imbalanced. We also show through experiments on popular real-world datasets that our proposed model often outperforms its regularized counterpart as the first accounts for uncertain labels unlike the latter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmet Kapki\c{c}, Pratanu Mandal, Shu Wan, Paras Sheth, Abhinav Gorantla, Yoonhyuk Choi, Huan Liu, K. Sel\c{c}uk Candan</p>
<p>Abstract: While witnessing the exceptional success of machine learning (ML) technologies in many applications, users are starting to notice a critical shortcoming of ML: correlation is a poor substitute for causation. The conventional way to discover causal relationships is to use randomized controlled experiments (RCT); in many situations, however, these are impractical or sometimes unethical. Causal learning from observational data offers a promising alternative. While being relatively recent, causal learning aims to go far beyond conventional machine learning, yet several major challenges remain. Unfortunately, advances are hampered due to the lack of unified benchmark datasets, algorithms, metrics, and evaluation service interfaces for causal learning. In this paper, we introduce {\em CausalBench}, a transparent, fair, and easy-to-use evaluation platform, aiming to (a) enable the advancement of research in causal learning by facilitating scientific collaboration in novel algorithms, datasets, and metrics and (b) promote scientific objectivity, reproducibility, fairness, and awareness of bias in causal learning research. CausalBench provides services for benchmarking data, algorithms, models, and metrics, impacting the needs of a broad of scientific and engineering disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Zhang, Yorie Nakahira, Guannan Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy design in non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is inherently challenging due to the complexities introduced by time-varying system transition and reward, which make it difficult for learners to determine the optimal actions for maximizing cumulative future rewards. Fortunately, in many practical applications, such as energy systems, look-ahead predictions are available, including forecasts for renewable energy generation and demand. In this paper, we leverage these look-ahead predictions and propose an algorithm designed to achieve low regret in non-stationary MDPs by incorporating such predictions. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, the regret decreases exponentially as the look-ahead window expands. When the system prediction is subject to error, the regret does not explode even if the prediction error grows sub-exponentially as a function of the prediction horizon. We validate our approach through simulations, confirming the efficacy of our algorithm in non-stationary environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08474">Rethinking Meta-Learning from a Learning Lens</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Wang, Wenwen Qiang, Jiangmeng Li, Lingyu Si, Changwen Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful approach for leveraging knowledge from previous tasks to solve new tasks. The mainstream methods focus on training a well-generalized model initialization, which is then adapted to different tasks with limited data and updates. However, it pushes the model overfitting on the training tasks. Previous methods mainly attributed this to the lack of data and used augmentations to address this issue, but they were limited by sufficient training and effective augmentation strategies. In this work, we focus on the more fundamental ``learning to learn'' strategy of meta-learning to explore what causes errors and how to eliminate these errors without changing the environment. Specifically, we first rethink the algorithmic procedure of meta-learning from a ``learning'' lens. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that (i) this paradigm faces the risk of both overfitting and underfitting and (ii) the model adapted to different tasks promote each other where the effect is stronger if the tasks are more similar. Based on this insight, we propose using task relations to calibrate the optimization process of meta-learning and propose a plug-and-play method called Task Relation Learner (TRLearner) to achieve this goal. Specifically, it first obtains task relation matrices from the extracted task-specific meta-data. Then, it uses the obtained matrices with relation-aware consistency regularization to guide optimization. Extensive theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of TRLearner.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08477">Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Oommen, Aniruddha Bora, Zhen Zhang, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08482">Risks When Sharing LoRA Fine-Tuned Diffusion Model Weights</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixi Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emerging trend in generative models and convenient public access to diffusion models pre-trained on large datasets, users can fine-tune these models to generate images of personal faces or items in new contexts described by natural language. Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the most common way to save memory and computation usage on the user end during fine-tuning. However, a natural question is whether the private images used for fine-tuning will be leaked to adversaries when sharing model weights. In this paper, we study the issue of privacy leakage of a fine-tuned diffusion model in a practical setting, where adversaries only have access to model weights, rather than prompts or images used for fine-tuning. We design and build a variational network autoencoder that takes model weights as input and outputs the reconstruction of private images. To improve the efficiency of training such an autoencoder, we propose a training paradigm with the help of timestep embedding. The results give a surprising answer to this research question: an adversary can generate images containing the same identities as the private images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no existing defense method, including differential privacy-based methods, can preserve the privacy of private data used for fine-tuning a diffusion model without compromising the utility of a fine-tuned model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Li, Wei Jin, Geri Skenderi, Harry Shomer, Wenzhuo Tang, Wenqi Fan, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent a contemporary class of generative models with exceptional qualities in both synthesis and maximizing the data likelihood. These models work by traversing a forward Markov Chain where data is perturbed, followed by a reverse process where a neural network learns to undo the perturbations and recover the original data. There have been increasing efforts exploring the applications of DDPMs in the graph domain. However, most of them have focused on the generative perspective. In this paper, we aim to build a novel generative model for link prediction. In particular, we treat link prediction between a pair of nodes as a conditional likelihood estimation of its enclosing sub-graph. With a dedicated design to decompose the likelihood estimation process via the Bayesian formula, we are able to separate the estimation of sub-graph structure and its node features. Such designs allow our model to simultaneously enjoy the advantages of inductive learning and the strong generalization capability. Remarkably, comprehensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed method presents numerous advantages: (1) transferability across datasets without retraining, (2) promising generalization on limited training data, and (3) robustness against graph adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixi Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emerging trend of large generative models, ControlNet is introduced to enable users to fine-tune pre-trained models with their own data for various use cases. A natural question arises: how can we train ControlNet models while ensuring users' data privacy across distributed devices? Exploring different distributed training schemes, we find conventional federated learning and split learning unsuitable. Instead, we propose a new distributed learning structure that eliminates the need for the server to send gradients back. Through a comprehensive evaluation of existing threats, we discover that in the context of training ControlNet with split learning, most existing attacks are ineffective, except for two mentioned in previous literature. To counter these threats, we leverage the properties of diffusion models and design a new timestep sampling policy during forward processes. We further propose a privacy-preserving activation function and a method to prevent private text prompts from leaving clients, tailored for image generation with diffusion models. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms and systems greatly enhance the efficiency of distributed training for ControlNet while ensuring users' data privacy without compromising image generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqing Zhang, Junming Huang, Ruotong Wang, Changsong Wei, Wenqian Huang, Yuxin Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state-space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Sun, Cong Wu, Shahid Mumtaz, Junyi Tao, Mingsheng Cao, Mei Wang, Valerio Frascolla</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of satellite communications, integrating advanced machine learning techniques, particularly split learning, is crucial for enhancing data processing and model training efficiency across satellites, space stations, and ground stations. Traditional ML approaches often face significant challenges within satellite networks due to constraints such as limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for more efficient SL in satellite communications. Our approach, Dynamic Topology Informed Pruning, namely DTIP, combines differential privacy with graph and model pruning to optimize graph neural networks for distributed learning. DTIP strategically applies differential privacy to raw graph data and prunes GNNs, thereby optimizing both model size and communication load across network tiers. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate DTIP's efficacy in enhancing privacy, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Specifically, on Amazon2M dataset, DTIP maintains an accuracy of 0.82 while achieving a 50% reduction in floating-point operations per second. Similarly, on ArXiv dataset, DTIP achieves an accuracy of 0.85 under comparable conditions. Our framework not only significantly improves the operational efficiency of satellite communications but also establishes a new benchmark in privacy-aware distributed learning, potentially revolutionizing data handling in space-based networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojing Du, Feiyu Yang, Wentao Gao, Xiongren Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As network data applications continue to expand, causal inference within networks has garnered increasing attention. However, hidden confounders complicate the estimation of causal effects. Most methods rely on the strong ignorability assumption, which presumes the absence of hidden confounders-an assumption that is both difficult to validate and often unrealistic in practice. To address this issue, we propose CgNN, a novel approach that leverages network structure as instrumental variables (IVs), combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to mitigate hidden confounder bias and improve causal effect estimation. By utilizing network structure as IVs, we reduce confounder bias while preserving the correlation with treatment. Our integration of attention mechanisms enhances robustness and improves the identification of important nodes. Validated on two real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that CgNN effectively mitigates hidden confounder bias and offers a robust GNN-driven IV framework for causal inference in complex network data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Cavallo, Madeline Navarro, Santiago Segarra, Elvin Isufi</p>
<p>Abstract: Covariance-based data processing is widespread across signal processing and machine learning applications due to its ability to model data interconnectivities and dependencies. However, harmful biases in the data may become encoded in the sample covariance matrix and cause data-driven methods to treat different subpopulations unfairly. Existing works such as fair principal component analysis (PCA) mitigate these effects, but remain unstable in low sample regimes, which in turn may jeopardize the fairness goal. To address both biases and instability, we propose Fair coVariance Neural Networks (FVNNs), which perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix for both fair and accurate predictions. Our FVNNs provide a flexible model compatible with several existing bias mitigation techniques. In particular, FVNNs allow for mitigating the bias in two ways: first, they operate on fair covariance estimates that remove biases from their principal components; second, they are trained in an end-to-end fashion via a fairness regularizer in the loss function so that the model parameters are tailored to solve the task directly in a fair manner. We prove that FVNNs are intrinsically fairer than analogous PCA approaches thanks to their stability in low sample regimes. We validate the robustness and fairness of our model on synthetic and real-world data, showcasing the flexibility of FVNNs along with the tradeoff between fair and accurate performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuhiro Fukui, Pedro H. V. Valois, Lincon Souza, Takumi Kobayashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Subspace representation is a fundamental technique in various fields of machine learning. Analyzing a geometrical relationship among multiple subspaces is essential for understanding subspace series' temporal and/or spatial dynamics. This paper proposes the second-order difference subspace, a higher-order extension of the first-order difference subspace between two subspaces that can analyze the geometrical difference between them. As a preliminary for that, we extend the definition of the first-order difference subspace to the more general setting that two subspaces with different dimensions have an intersection. We then define the second-order difference subspace by combining the concept of first-order difference subspace and principal component subspace (Karcher mean) between two subspaces, motivated by the second-order central difference method. We can understand that the first/second-order difference subspaces correspond to the velocity and acceleration of subspace dynamics from the viewpoint of a geodesic on a Grassmann manifold. We demonstrate the validity and naturalness of our second-order difference subspace by showing numerical results on two applications: temporal shape analysis of a 3D object and time series analysis of a biometric signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asaf Cassel (School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University), Orin Levy (School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University), Yishay Mansour (School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Google Research, Tel Aviv)</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently trading off exploration and exploitation is one of the key challenges in online Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most works achieve this by carefully estimating the model uncertainty and following the so-called optimistic model. Inspired by practical ensemble methods, in this work we propose a simple and novel batch ensemble scheme that provably achieves near-optimal regret for stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). Crucially, our algorithm has just a single parameter, namely the number of batches, and its value does not depend on distributional properties such as the scale and variance of the losses. We complement our theoretical results by demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08580">Molecular Graph Representation Learning via Structural Similarity Information</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Yao, Hong Huang, Hang Gao, Fengge Wu, Haiming Chen, Junsuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed for feature representation learning in molecular graphs. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the expressiveness of feature representation to ensure the effectiveness of GNNs. However, a significant portion of current research primarily focuses on the structural features within individual molecules, often overlooking the structural similarity between molecules, which is a crucial aspect encapsulating rich information on the relationship between molecular properties and structural characteristics. Thus, these approaches fail to capture the rich semantic information at the molecular structure level. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Molecular Structural Similarity Motif GNN (MSSM-GNN)}, a novel molecular graph representation learning method that can capture structural similarity information among molecules from a global perspective. In particular, we propose a specially designed graph that leverages graph kernel algorithms to represent the similarity between molecules quantitatively. Subsequently, we employ GNNs to learn feature representations from molecular graphs, aiming to enhance the accuracy of property prediction by incorporating additional molecular representation information. Finally, through a series of experiments conducted on both small-scale and large-scale molecular datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Yang, Padunna Valappil Krishnaraj Sekhar, Sho Sekine, Yilin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In e-commerce platforms, coupons play a crucial role in boosting transactions. In the customer-to-customer (C2C) marketplace, ensuring the satisfaction of both buyers and sellers is essential. While buyer-focused marketing strategies often receive more attention, addressing the needs of sellers is equally important. Additionally, the existing strategies tend to optimize each promotion independently, resulting in a lack of continuity between promotions and unnecessary costs in the pursuit of short-term impact within each promotion period.
  We introduce a Dynamic Sequential Coupon Allocation Framework (DSCAF) to optimize item coupon allocation strategies across a series of promotions. DSCAF provides sequential recommendations for coupon configurations and timing to target items. In cases where initial suggestions do not lead to sales, it dynamically adjusts the strategy and offers subsequent solutions. It integrates two predictors for estimating the sale propensity in the current and subsequent rounds of coupon allocation, and a decision-making process to determine the coupon allocation solution. It runs iteratively until the item is sold. The goal of the framework is to maximize Return on Investment (ROI) while ensuring lift Sell-through Rate (STR) remains above a specified threshold. DSCAF aims to optimize sequential coupon efficiency with a long-term perspective rather than solely focusing on the lift achieved in each individual promotion. It has been applied for item coupon allocation in Mercari.</p>

We propose a comprehensive, hardware-agnostic solution to address both correlated and uncorrelated noise affecting the activation layers of deep neural models. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to demystify the "black box" nature of noise-resilient networks by revealing the underlying mechanisms that reduce sensitivity to noise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars B\"ocking, Leopold M\"uller, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: The selection of algorithms is a crucial step in designing AI services for real-world time series classification use cases. Traditional methods such as neural architecture search, automated machine learning, combined algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimizations are effective but require considerable computational resources and necessitate access to all data points to run their optimizations. In this work, we introduce a novel data fingerprint that describes any time series classification dataset in a privacy-preserving manner and provides insight into the algorithm selection problem without requiring training on the (unseen) dataset. By decomposing the multi-target regression problem, only our data fingerprints are used to estimate algorithm performance and uncertainty in a scalable and adaptable manner. Our approach is evaluated on the 112 University of California riverside benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the performance of 35 state-of-the-art algorithms and providing valuable insights for effective algorithm selection in time series classification service systems, improving a naive baseline by 7.32% on average in estimating the mean performance and 15.81% in estimating the uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changxin Liu, Yanghao Li, Yuhao Yi, Karl H. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning has become the standard approach for training large-scale machine learning models across private data silos. While distributed learning enhances privacy preservation and training efficiency, it faces critical challenges related to Byzantine robustness and communication reduction. Existing Byzantine-robust and communication-efficient methods rely on full gradient information either at every iteration or at certain iterations with a probability, and they only converge to an unnecessarily large neighborhood around the solution. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust and communication-efficient stochastic distributed learning method that imposes no requirements on batch size and converges to a smaller neighborhood around the optimal solution than all existing methods, aligning with the theoretical lower bound. Our key innovation is leveraging Polyak Momentum to mitigate the noise caused by both biased compressors and stochastic gradients, thus defending against Byzantine workers under information compression. We provide proof of tight complexity bounds for our algorithm in the context of non-convex smooth loss functions, demonstrating that these bounds match the lower bounds in Byzantine-free scenarios. Finally, we validate the practical significance of our algorithm through an extensive series of experiments, benchmarking its performance on both binary classification and image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anita Eisenb\"urger, Daniel Otten, Anselm Hudde, Frank Hopfgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: Label noise refers to the phenomenon where instances in a data set are assigned to the wrong label. Label noise is harmful to classifier performance, increases model complexity and impairs feature selection. Addressing label noise is crucial, yet current research primarily focuses on image and text data using deep neural networks. This leaves a gap in the study of tabular data and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs), the leading algorithm for tabular data. Different methods have already been developed which either try to filter label noise, model label noise while simultaneously training a classifier or use learning algorithms which remain effective even if label noise is present. This study aims to further investigate the effects of label noise on gradient-boosted decision trees and methods to mitigate those effects. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, the implemented methods demonstrate state-of-the-art noise detection performance on the Adult dataset and achieve the highest classification precision and recall on the Adult and Breast Cancer datasets, respectively. In summary, this paper enhances the understanding of the impact of label noise on GBDTs and lays the groundwork for future research in noise detection and correction methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08658">Promoting Fairness in Link Prediction with Graph Enhancement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yezi Liu, Hanning Chen, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction is a crucial task in network analysis, but it has been shown to be prone to biased predictions, particularly when links are unfairly predicted between nodes from different sensitive groups. In this paper, we study the fair link prediction problem, which aims to ensure that the predicted link probability is independent of the sensitive attributes of the connected nodes. Existing methods typically incorporate debiasing techniques within graph embeddings to mitigate this issue. However, training on large real-world graphs is already challenging, and adding fairness constraints can further complicate the process. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairLink, a method that learns a fairness-enhanced graph to bypass the need for debiasing during the link predictor's training. FairLink maintains link prediction accuracy by ensuring that the enhanced graph follows a training trajectory similar to that of the original input graph. Meanwhile, it enhances fairness by minimizing the absolute difference in link probabilities between node pairs within the same sensitive group and those between node pairs from different sensitive groups. Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graphs demonstrate that FairLink not only promotes fairness but also often achieves link prediction accuracy comparable to baseline methods. Most importantly, the enhanced graph exhibits strong generalizability across different GNN architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08660">Online Learning Of Expanding Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Rey, Bishwadeep Das, Elvin Isufi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online network topology inference for expanding graphs from a stream of spatiotemporal signals. Online algorithms for dynamic graph learning are crucial in delay-sensitive applications or when changes in topology occur rapidly. While existing works focus on inferring the connectivity within a fixed set of nodes, in practice, the graph can grow as new nodes join the network. This poses additional challenges like modeling temporal dynamics involving signals and graphs of different sizes. This growth also increases the computational complexity of the learning process, which may become prohibitive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this setting. We propose a general online algorithm based on projected proximal gradient descent that accounts for the increasing graph size at each iteration. Recursively updating the sample covariance matrix is a key aspect of our approach. We introduce a strategy that enables different types of updates for nodes that just joined the network and for previously existing nodes. To provide further insights into the proposed method, we specialize it in Gaussian Markov random field settings, where we analyze the computational complexity and characterize the dynamic cumulative regret. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both controlled experiments and real-world datasets from epidemic and financial networks.</p>

This is more complex in AI than in traditional methods. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive mind map of formal AI certification in avionics. It highlights the challenges of certifying AI development with an example to emphasize the need for qualification beyond performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Rey, Madeline Navarro, Victor M. Tenorio, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a workhorse approach for learning from data defined over irregular domains, typically by implicitly assuming that the data structure is represented by a homophilic graph. However, recent works have revealed that many relevant applications involve heterophilic data where the performance of GNNs can be notably compromised. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective architecture designed to mitigate the limitations of the homophily assumption. The proposed architecture reinterprets the role of graph filters in convolutional GNNs, resulting in a more general architecture while incorporating a stronger inductive bias than GNNs based on filter banks. The proposed convolutional layer enhances the expressive capacity of the architecture enabling it to learn from both homophilic and heterophilic data and preventing the issue of oversmoothing. From a theoretical standpoint, we show that the proposed architecture is permutation equivariant. Finally, we show that the proposed GNNs compares favorably relative to several state-of-the-art baselines in both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, showcasing its promising potential.</p>

This study explores the application of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to predict weight loss changes in overweight and obese individuals. Using wearable data from a 1-month trial involving around 100 subjects from the AI4FoodDB database, including biomarkers, vital signs, and behavioral data, we identify key differences between those achieving weight loss (>= 2% of their initial weight) and those who do not. Feature selection techniques and classification algorithms reveal promising results, with the Gradient Boosting classifier achieving 84.44% Area Under the Curve (AUC). The integration of multiple data sources (e.g., vital signs, physical and sleep activity, etc.) enhances performance, suggesting the potential of wearable devices and AI in personalized healthcare.</p>

Up to now, although the definition of knowledge encoded by the DNN has not reached a consensus, Previous studies have derived a series of mathematical evidence to take interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN. We extend the definition of interactions and, for the first time, extract interactions encoded by intermediate layers. We quantify and track the newly emerged interactions and the forgotten interactions in each layer during the forward propagation, which shed new light on the learning behavior of DNNs. The layer-wise change of interactions also reveals the change of the generalization capacity and instability of feature representations of a DNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khadichabonu Valieva, Bikramjit Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: As a generalization of reinforcement learning (RL) to parametrizable goals, goal conditioned RL (GCRL) has a broad range of applications, particularly in challenging tasks in robotics. Recent work has established that the optimal value function of GCRL $Q^\ast(s,a,g)$ has a quasimetric structure, leading to targetted neural architectures that respect such structure. However, the relevant analyses assume a sparse reward setting -- a known aggravating factor to sample complexity. We show that the key property underpinning a quasimetric, viz., the triangle inequality, is preserved under a dense reward setting as well. Contrary to earlier findings where dense rewards were shown to be detrimental to GCRL, we identify the key condition necessary for triangle inequality. Dense reward functions that satisfy this condition can only improve, never worsen, sample complexity. This opens up opportunities to train efficient neural architectures with dense rewards, compounding their benefits to sample complexity. We evaluate this proposal in 12 standard benchmark environments in GCRL featuring challenging continuous control tasks. Our empirical results confirm that training a quasimetric value function in our dense reward setting indeed outperforms training with sparse rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonkyu Lim, Jeongwhan Choi, Noseong Park, Sang-Ha Yoon, ShinHyuck Kang, Young-Min Kim, Hyunjoong Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models.

As the number of samples increases, both performance and equivariance improve, yet this also leads to higher computational costs. To address this, we introduce an adaptive sampling approach that dynamically adjusts the sampling process to the symmetries in the data, reducing the number of required group samples and lowering the computational demands. We explore various implementations and their effects on model performance, equivariance, and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate improved model performance, and a marginal increase in memory efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recommender systems in online marketplaces face the challenge of balancing multiple objectives to satisfy various stakeholders, including customers, providers, and the platform itself. This paper introduces Juggler-MAB, a hybrid approach that combines meta-learning with Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) to address the limitations of existing multi-stakeholder recommendation systems. Our method extends the Juggler framework, which uses meta-learning to predict optimal weights for utility and compensation adjustments, by incorporating a MAB component for real-time, context-specific refinements. We present a two-stage approach where Juggler provides initial weight predictions, followed by MAB-based adjustments that adapt to rapid changes in user behavior and market conditions. Our system leverages contextual features such as device type and brand to make fine-grained weight adjustments based on specific segments. To evaluate our approach, we developed a simulation framework using a dataset of 0.6 million searches from Expedia's lodging booking platform. Results show that Juggler-MAB outperforms the original Juggler model across all metrics, with NDCG improvements of 2.9%, a 13.7% reduction in regret, and a 9.8% improvement in best arm selection rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) has shown remarkable success in uncertainty estimation. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and classification tasks. The limited OOD detection performance of EDL arises from its inability to reflect the distance between the testing example and training data when quantifying uncertainty, while its limited classification performance stems from its parameterization of the concentration parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning (DAEDL). DAEDL integrates the feature space density of the testing example with the output of EDL during the prediction stage, while using a novel parameterization that resolves the issues in the conventional parameterization. We prove that DAEDL enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties. DAEDL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks related to uncertainty estimation and classification</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph learning is the fundamental task of estimating unknown graph connectivity from available data. Typical approaches assume that not only is all information available simultaneously but also that all nodes can be observed. However, in many real-world scenarios, data can neither be known completely nor obtained all at once. We present a novel method for online graph estimation that accounts for the presence of hidden nodes. We consider signals that are stationary on the underlying graph, which provides a model for the unknown connections to hidden nodes. We then formulate a convex optimization problem for graph learning from streaming, incomplete graph signals. We solve the proposed problem through an efficient proximal gradient algorithm that can run in real-time as data arrives sequentially. Additionally, we provide theoretical conditions under which our online algorithm is similar to batch-wise solutions. Through experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the viability of our approach for online graph learning in the presence of missing observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyi Zhuang, Yuheng Bu, Guang Wang, Shenhao Wang, Jinhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty is crucial for robust and reliable predictions. However, existing spatiotemporal deep learning mostly focuses on deterministic prediction, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in such prediction. Particularly, highly-granular spatiotemporal datasets are often sparse, posing extra challenges in prediction and uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel post-hoc Sparsity-awar Uncertainty Calibration (SAUC) framework, which calibrates uncertainty in both zero and non-zero values. To develop SAUC, we firstly modify the state-of-the-art deterministic spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) to probabilistic ones in the pre-calibration phase. Then we calibrate the probabilistic ST-GNNs for zero and non-zero values using quantile approaches.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SAUC can effectively fit the variance of sparse data and generalize across two real-world spatiotemporal datasets at various granularities. Specifically, our empirical experiments show a 20\% reduction in calibration errors in zero entries on the sparse traffic accident and urban crime prediction. Overall, this work demonstrates the theoretical and empirical values of the SAUC framework, thus bridging a significant gap between uncertainty quantification and spatiotemporal prediction.</p>

In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Philippenko, Kevin Scaman, Laurent Massouli\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on $N$ clients, each holding a local dataset $\mathbf{S}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, mathematically, we seek to solve $min_{\mathbf{U}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i\times r}, \mathbf{V}\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} } \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{S}^i - \mathbf{U}^i \mathbf{V}^\top\|^2_{\text{F}}$. Considering a power initialization of $\mathbf{V}$, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client $i$ in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, we obtain a global $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ common to all clients and a local variable $\mathbf{U}^i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times r}$. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on $\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{r}$, where $\sigma_{r}$ is the $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ singular value of the concatenation $\mathbf{S}$ of the matrices $(\mathbf{S}^i)_{i=1}^N$. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on $\sigma_{\max}^2 / \sigma_{\min}^2$. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Tang, Tong Xia, Yuan Lu, Cecilia Mascolo, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and generating comprehensive reports remain challenging tasks in cardiology, often requiring specialized expertise and significant time investment. To address these critical issues, we propose ECG-ReGen, a retrieval-based approach for ECG-to-text report generation and question answering. Our method leverages a self-supervised learning for the ECG encoder, enabling efficient similarity searches and report retrieval. By combining pre-training with dynamic retrieval and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement, ECG-ReGen effectively analyzes ECG data and answers related queries, with the potential of improving patient care. Experiments conducted on the PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets demonstrate superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios for report generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits competitive performance on ECG-QA dataset compared to fully supervised methods when utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs for zero-shot question answering. This approach, effectively combining self-supervised encoder and LLMs, offers a scalable and efficient solution for accurate ECG interpretation, holding significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Sharpnack, Phoebe Mulcaire, Klinton Bicknell, Geoff LaFlair, Kevin Yancey</p>
<p>Abstract: Item response theory (IRT) is a class of interpretable factor models that are widely used in computerized adaptive tests (CATs), such as language proficiency tests. Traditionally, these are fit using parametric mixed effects models on the probability of a test taker getting the correct answer to a test item (i.e., question). Neural net extensions of these models, such as BertIRT, require specialized architectures and parameter tuning. We propose a multistage fitting procedure that is compatible with out-of-the-box Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools. It is based on a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) outer loop with a two stage inner loop, which trains a non-parametric AutoML grade model using item features followed by an item specific parametric model. This greatly accelerates the modeling workflow for scoring tests. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to the Duolingo English Test, a high stakes, online English proficiency test. We show that the resulting model is typically more well calibrated, gets better predictive performance, and more accurate scores than existing methods (non-explanatory IRT models and explanatory IRT models like BERT-IRT). Along the way, we provide a brief survey of machine learning methods for calibration of item parameters for CATs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahman Ejaz, Varchas Gopalaswamy, Riccardo Betti, Aarne Lees, Christopher Kanan</p>
<p>Abstract: The domain of laser fusion presents a unique and challenging predictive modeling application landscape for machine learning methods due to high problem complexity and limited training data. Data-driven approaches utilizing prescribed functional forms, inductive biases and physics-informed learning (PIL) schemes have been successful in the past for achieving desired generalization ability and model interpretation that aligns with physics expectations. In complex multi-physics application domains, however, it is not always obvious how architectural biases or discriminative penalties can be formulated. In this work, focusing on nuclear fusion energy using high powered lasers, we present the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to PIL for developing a new type of data-driven predictive model which is able to achieve high prediction accuracy and physics interpretability. A KAN based model, a MLP with PIL, and a baseline MLP model are compared in generalization ability and interpretation with a domain expert-derived symbolic regression model. Through empirical studies in this high physics complexity domain, we show that KANs can potentially provide benefits when developing predictive models for data-starved physics applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carles Domingo-Enrich, Michal Drozdzal, Brian Karrer, Ricky T. Q. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there has not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing various data structures, including graphs. While previous research has focused on developing textual encoding methods for graph representation, the emergence of multimodal LLMs presents a new frontier for graph comprehension. These advanced models, capable of processing both text and images, offer potential improvements in graph understanding by incorporating visual representations alongside traditional textual data. This study investigates the impact of graph visualisations on LLM performance across a range of benchmark tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhi Jing, Hongguang Zhao, Shujun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing reasonable standards for edible chrysanthemum seedlings helps promote seedling development, thereby improving plant quality. However, current grading methods have the several issues. The limitation that only support a few indicators causes information loss, and indicators selected to evaluate seedling level have a narrow applicability. Meanwhile, some methods misuse mathematical formulas. Therefore, we propose a simple, efficient, and generic framework, SQCSEF, for establishing seedling quality classification standards with flexible clustering modules, applicable to most plant species. In this study, we introduce the state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithm CVCL, using factor analysis to divide indicators into several perspectives as inputs for the CVCL method, resulting in more reasonable clusters and ultimately a grading standard $S_{cvcl}$ for edible chrysanthemum seedlings. Through conducting extensive experiments, we validate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed SQCSEF framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Liang, Najmeh Abiri, Atiye Sadat Hashemi, Jens Lundstr\"om, Stefan Byttner, Prayag Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiana Vu, Phung Lai, Truc Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its significant benefits in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, explainable AI (XAI) has yet to reach its full potential in real-world applications. One key challenge is that XAI can unintentionally provide adversaries with insights into black-box models, inevitably increasing their vulnerability to various attacks. In this paper, we develop a novel explanation-driven adversarial attack against black-box classifiers based on feature substitution, called XSub. The key idea of XSub is to strategically replace important features (identified via XAI) in the original sample with corresponding important features from a "golden sample" of a different label, thereby increasing the likelihood of the model misclassifying the perturbed sample. The degree of feature substitution is adjustable, allowing us to control how much of the original samples information is replaced. This flexibility effectively balances a trade-off between the attacks effectiveness and its stealthiness. XSub is also highly cost-effective in that the number of required queries to the prediction model and the explanation model in conducting the attack is in O(1). In addition, XSub can be easily extended to launch backdoor attacks in case the attacker has access to the models training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that XSub is not only effective and stealthy but also cost-effective, enabling its application across a wide range of AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Cisneros-Velarde, Zhijie Chen, Sanmi Koyejo, Arindam Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight normalization (WeightNorm) is widely used in practice for the training of deep neural networks and modern deep learning libraries have built-in implementations of it. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08946">DELTA: Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty for Active Graph Domain Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyun Wang, Yadi Cao, Chris Russell, Siyu Heng, Junyu Luo, Yanxin Shen, Xiao Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from substructures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, Kai Yang, Hengrui Zhang, David Wipf, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations on large graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature. Transformers recently have shown promising performance on small graphs thanks to its global attention for capturing all-pair interactions beyond observed structures. Existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated architectures by stacking deep attention-based propagation layers. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the necessity of adopting multi-layer attentions in Transformers on graphs, which considerably restricts the efficiency. Specifically, we analyze a generic hybrid propagation layer, comprised of all-pair attention and graph-based propagation, and show that multi-layer propagation can be reduced to one-layer propagation, with the same capability for representation learning. It suggests a new technical path for building powerful and efficient Transformers on graphs, particularly through simplifying model architectures without sacrificing expressiveness. As exemplified by this work, we propose a Simplified Single-layer Graph Transformers (SGFormer), whose main component is a single-layer global attention that scales linearly w.r.t. graph sizes and requires none of any approximation for accommodating all-pair interactions. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M, yielding orders-of-magnitude inference acceleration over peer Transformers on medium-sized graphs, and demonstrates competitiveness with limited labeled data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-invasive and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for the early prevention of many cardiovascular diseases. Estimating arterial blood pressure (ABP) from photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing deep learning approaches for PPG-to-ABP reconstruction (PAR) encounter certain information loss, impacting the precision of the reconstructed signal. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an invertible neural network for PPG to ABP reconstruction (INN-PAR), which employs a series of invertible blocks to jointly learn the mapping between PPG and its gradient with the ABP signal and its gradient. INN-PAR efficiently captures both forward and inverse mappings simultaneously, thereby preventing information loss. By integrating signal gradients into the learning process, INN-PAR enhances the network's ability to capture essential high-frequency details, leading to more accurate signal reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a multi-scale convolution module (MSCM) within the invertible block, enabling the model to learn features across multiple scales effectively. We have experimented on two benchmark datasets, which show that INN-PAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both waveform reconstruction and BP measurement accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

<p>Abstract: The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial domain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent financial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in financial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), challenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating the modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these capabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and interpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series data. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in financial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced with such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based architecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs, StockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It leverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating stock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as stock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock prices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the embedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts stock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate that StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions while reducing memory usage and runtime costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Zhu, Yuante Li, Yifan Hu, Qinyuan Liu, Dawei Cheng, Yuqi Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods.

Tsinghua University's related research also suggests using dynamically adjusted activation functions. Building on the ideas of using fine-tuned activation functions from Tsinghua University and Huawei Noah's Lab, we propose a series-based learnable ac-tivation function called LSLU (Learnable Series Linear Units). This method simplifies deep learning networks while im-proving accuracy. This method introduces learnable parameters {\theta} and {\omega} to control the activation function, adapting it to the current layer's training stage and improving the model's generalization. The principle is to increase non-linearity in each activation layer, boosting the network's overall non-linearity. We evaluate LSLU's performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and specific task datasets (e.g., Silkworm), validating its effectiveness. The convergence behavior of the learnable parameters {\theta} and {\omega}, as well as their effects on generalization, are analyzed. Our empirical results show that LSLU enhances the general-ization ability of the original model in various tasks while speeding up training. In VanillaNet training, parameter {\theta} initially decreases, then increases before stabilizing, while {\omega} shows an opposite trend. Ultimately, LSLU achieves a 3.17% accuracy improvement on CIFAR100 for VanillaNet (Table 3). Codes are available at https://github.com/vontran2021/Learnable-series-linear-units-LSLU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanglu Yan, Zhenyu Bai, Weng-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are generally regarded as more energy-efficient because they do not use multiplications. However, most SNN works only consider the counting of additions to evaluate energy consumption, neglecting other overheads such as memory accesses and data movement operations. This oversight can lead to a misleading perception of efficiency, especially when state-of-the-art SNN accelerators operate with very small time window sizes. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the energy consumption of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs from a hardware perspective. We provide accurate formulas for energy consumption based on classical multi-level memory hierarchy architectures, commonly used neuromorphic dataflow architectures, and our proposed improved spatial-dataflow architecture. Our research demonstrates that to achieve comparable accuracy and greater energy efficiency than ANNs, SNNs require strict limitations on both time window size T and sparsity s. For instance, with the VGG16 model and a fixed T of 6, the neuron sparsity rate must exceed 93% to ensure energy efficiency across most architectures. Inspired by our findings, we explore strategies to enhance energy efficiency by increasing sparsity. We introduce two regularization terms during training that constrain weights and activations, effectively boosting the sparsity rate. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using T of 6, show that our SNNs consume 69% of the energy used by optimized ANNs on spatial-dataflow architectures, while maintaining an SNN accuracy of 94.18%. This framework, developed using PyTorch, is publicly available for use and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Ko\v{r}enek, Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka</p>
<p>Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, financial analysts have been trying to develop models to predict the movement of a stock price index. The task becomes challenging in vague economic, social, and political situations like in Pakistan. In this study, we employed efficient models of machine learning such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to predict the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index by taking monthly data of twenty-six economic, social, political, and administrative indicators from February 2004 to December 2020. The comparative results of LSTM and QLSTM predicted values of the KSE 100 index with the actual values suggested QLSTM a potential technique to predict stock market trends.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Soto, Matthew Reimherr, Aleksandra Slavkovic, Mark Shriver</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of releasing a Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) 3D human face. The human face is a complex structure with many features and inherently tied to one's identity. Protecting this data, in a formally private way, is important yet challenging given the dimensionality of the problem. We extend approximate DP techniques for functional data to the GDP framework. We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget. Our mechanism consists of two primary components, the first is generally applicable to function value summaries (as are commonly found in nonparametric statistics or functional data analysis) while the second is general to disk-like surfaces and hence more applicable than just to human faces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip Fradkin, Puria Azadi, Karush Suri, Frederik Wenkel, Ali Bashashati, Maciej Sypetkowski, Dominique Beaini</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting molecular impact on cellular function is a core challenge in therapeutic design. Phenomic experiments, designed to capture cellular morphology, utilize microscopy based techniques and demonstrate a high throughput solution for uncovering molecular impact on the cell. In this work, we learn a joint latent space between molecular structures and microscopy phenomic experiments, aligning paired samples with contrastive learning. Specifically, we study the problem ofContrastive PhenoMolecular Retrieval, which consists of zero-shot molecular structure identification conditioned on phenomic experiments. We assess challenges in multi-modal learning of phenomics and molecular modalities such as experimental batch effect, inactive molecule perturbations, and encoding perturbation concentration. We demonstrate improved multi-modal learner retrieval through (1) a uni-modal pre-trained phenomics model, (2) a novel inter sample similarity aware loss, and (3) models conditioned on a representation of molecular concentration. Following this recipe, we propose MolPhenix, a molecular phenomics model. MolPhenix leverages a pre-trained phenomics model to demonstrate significant performance gains across perturbation concentrations, molecular scaffolds, and activity thresholds. In particular, we demonstrate an 8.1x improvement in zero shot molecular retrieval of active molecules over the previous state-of-the-art, reaching 77.33% in top-1% accuracy. These results open the door for machine learning to be applied in virtual phenomics screening, which can significantly benefit drug discovery applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Thebaud, Anna Favaro, Casey Chen, Gabrielle Chavez, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Ankur Butala, Najim Dehak</p>
<p>Abstract: Motor changes are early signs of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but are often difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. In this work, we examine the behavior of a wide array of explainable metrics extracted from the handwriting signals of 113 subjects performing multiple tasks on a digital tablet. The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing and assessing multiple NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific metrics are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which metrics provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and among different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the various tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted explainable metrics, which shows p-values lower than 0.0001 for multiple tasks. Using various classification algorithms on the computed metrics, we obtain up to 87% accuracy to discriminate AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69% for PD vs CTL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Russian Internet Trolls use fake personas to spread disinformation through multiple social media streams. Given the increased frequency of this threat across social media platforms, understanding those operations is paramount in combating their influence. Using Twitter content identified as part of the Russian influence network, we created a predictive model to map the network operations. We classify accounts type based on their authenticity function for a sub-sample of accounts by introducing logical categories and training a predictive model to identify similar behavior patterns across the network. Our model attains 88% prediction accuracy for the test set. Validation is done by comparing the similarities with the 3 million Russian troll tweets dataset. The result indicates a 90.7% similarity between the two datasets. Furthermore, we compare our model predictions on a Russian tweets dataset, and the results state that there is 90.5% correspondence between the predictions and the actual categories. The prediction and validation results suggest that our predictive model can assist with mapping the actors in such networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fault monitoring and diagnostics are important to ensure reliability of electric motors. Efficient algorithms for fault detection improve reliability, yet development of cost-effective and reliable classifiers for diagnostics of equipment is challenging, in particular due to unavailability of well-balanced datasets, with signals from properly functioning equipment and those from faulty equipment. Thus, we propose to use a Bayesian neural network to detect and classify faults in electric motors, given its efficacy with imbalanced training data. The performance of the proposed network is demonstrated on real life signals, and a robustness analysis of the proposed solution is provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Gentiloni Silveri, Giovanni Conforti, Alain Durmus</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows) stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$, leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumptions on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, we establish bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $L^2$-drift-approximation error assumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kassi Nzalasse, Rishav Raj, Eli Laird, Corey Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence applications expand, the evaluation of models faces heightened scrutiny. Ensuring public readiness requires evaluation datasets, which differ from training data by being disjoint and ethically sourced in compliance with privacy regulations. The performance and fairness of face recognition systems depend significantly on the quality and representativeness of these evaluation datasets. This data is sometimes scraped from the internet without user's consent, causing ethical concerns that can prohibit its use without proper releases. In rare cases, data is collected in a controlled environment with consent, however, this process is time-consuming, expensive, and logistically difficult to execute. This creates a barrier for those unable to conjure the immense resources required to gather ethically sourced evaluation datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synthetic Identity Generation pipeline, or SIG, that allows for the targeted creation of ethical, balanced datasets for face recognition evaluation. Our proposed and demonstrated pipeline generates high-quality images of synthetic identities with controllable pose, facial features, and demographic attributes, such as race, gender, and age. We also release an open-source evaluation dataset named ControlFace10k, consisting of 10,008 face images of 3,336 unique synthetic identities balanced across race, gender, and age, generated using the proposed SIG pipeline. We analyze ControlFace10k along with a non-synthetic BUPT dataset using state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness as an evaluation tool. This analysis highlights the dataset's characteristics and its utility in assessing algorithmic bias across different demographic groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zian Wang, Xinyi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of COMEX copper futures realized volatility across various high-frequency intervals using both econometric volatility models and deep learning recurrent neural network models. The econometric models considered are GARCH and HAR, while the deep learning models include RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). In forecasting daily realized volatility for COMEX copper futures with a rolling window approach, the econometric models, particularly HAR, outperform recurrent neural networks overall, with HAR achieving the lowest QLIKE loss function value. However, when the data is replaced with hourly high-frequency realized volatility, the deep learning models outperform the GARCH model, and HAR attains a comparable QLIKE loss function value. Despite the black-box nature of machine learning models, the deep learning models demonstrate superior forecasting performance, surpassing the fixed QLIKE value of HAR in the experiment. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends for daily realized volatility, deep learning models gradually close the performance gap with the GARCH model in certain loss function metrics. Nonetheless, HAR remains the most effective model overall for daily realized volatility forecasting in copper futures.</p>

Now, we apply it to data compression to help build the next generation of multimedia codecs. This thesis provides three primary contributions to this new field of learned compression. First, we present an efficient low-complexity entropy model that dynamically adapts the encoding distribution to a specific input by compressing and transmitting the encoding distribution itself as side information. Secondly, we propose a novel lightweight low-complexity point cloud codec that is highly specialized for classification, attaining significant reductions in bitrate compared to non-specialized codecs. Lastly, we explore how motion within the input domain between consecutive video frames is manifested in the corresponding convolutionally-derived latent space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samyak Rawlekar, Shubhang Bhatnagar, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been adapted for Multi-Label Recognition (MLR) with partial annotations by leveraging prompt-learning, where positive and negative prompts are learned for each class to associate their embeddings with class presence or absence in the shared vision-text feature space. While this approach improves MLR performance by relying on VLM priors, we hypothesize that learning negative prompts may be suboptimal, as the datasets used to train VLMs lack image-caption pairs explicitly focusing on class absence. To analyze the impact of positive and negative prompt learning on MLR, we introduce PositiveCoOp and NegativeCoOp, where only one prompt is learned with VLM guidance while the other is replaced by an embedding vector learned directly in the shared feature space without relying on the text encoder. Through empirical analysis, we observe that negative prompts degrade MLR performance, and learning only positive prompts, combined with learned negative embeddings (PositiveCoOp), outperforms dual prompt learning approaches. Moreover, we quantify the performance benefits that prompt-learning offers over a simple vision-features-only baseline, observing that the baseline displays strong performance comparable to dual prompt learning approach (DualCoOp), when the proportion of missing labels is low, while requiring half the training compute and 16 times fewer parameters</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanin Quartz, Ruikun Zhou, Hans De Sterck, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing a stabilizing controller for nonlinear systems is a challenging task, especially for high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms applied to stabilization tasks tend to drive the system close to the equilibrium point. However, these approaches often fall short of achieving true stabilization and result in persistent oscillations around the equilibrium point. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes the system by learning a local linear representation ofthe dynamics. The main component of the algorithm is integrating the learned gain matrix directly into the neural policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several challenging high-dimensional dynamical systems. In these simulations, our algorithm outperforms popular reinforcement learning algorithms, such as soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO), and successfully stabilizes the system. To support the numerical results, we provide a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of the learned algorithm for both deterministic and stochastic reinforcement learning settings, along with a convergence analysis of the proposed learning algorithm. Furthermore, we verify that the learned control policies indeed provide asymptotic stability for the nonlinear systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cluster analysis across multiple institutions poses significant challenges due to data-sharing restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Federated One-shot Ensemble Clustering (FONT) algorithm, a novel solution tailored for multi-site analyses under such constraints. FONT requires only a single round of communication between sites and ensures privacy by exchanging only fitted model parameters and class labels. The algorithm combines locally fitted clustering models into a data-adaptive ensemble, making it broadly applicable to various clustering techniques and robust to differences in cluster proportions across sites. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of the data-adaptive weights learned by FONT, and simulation studies demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmark methods. We applied FONT to identify subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis across two health systems, revealing improved consistency of patient clusters across sites, while locally fitted clusters proved less transferable. FONT is particularly well-suited for real-world applications with stringent communication and privacy constraints, offering a scalable and practical solution for multi-site clustering.</p>

It is a portfolio management problem which is solved by deep learning techniques. The original paper proposes a financial-model-free reinforcement learning framework, which consists of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function. Three different instants are used to realize this framework, namely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance is then examined by comparing to a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies. We have successfully replicated their implementations and evaluations. Besides, we further apply this framework in the stock market, instead of the cryptocurrency market that the original paper uses. The experiment in the cryptocurrency market is consistent with the original paper, which achieve superior returns. But it doesn't perform as well when applied in the stock market.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian St\"olzle, Cosimo Della Santina</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though a variety of methods (e.g., RL, MPC, LQR) have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control of physical systems remains an open challenge. A promising avenue would be to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems. Furthermore, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it presses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, (iii) we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iv) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we leverage these four properties and show that they enable latent-space control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Zhong, Heng Wang, Dan Klein, Jacob Steinhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate "discusses COVID". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Sayan Banerjee, Promit Ghosal</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernel Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is the observation that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, providing a near optimal double exponential improvement over the recent result by~\cite{shi2024finite}. Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow linearly in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zhu, Yiming Gong, Derek Hoiem</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an approach for anytime continual learning (AnytimeCL) for open vocabulary image classification. The AnytimeCL problem aims to break away from batch training and rigid models by requiring that a system can predict any set of labels at any time and efficiently update and improve when receiving one or more training samples at any time. Despite the challenging goal, we achieve substantial improvements over recent methods. We propose a dynamic weighting between predictions of a partially fine-tuned model and a fixed open vocabulary model that enables continual improvement when training samples are available for a subset of a task's labels. We also propose an attention-weighted PCA compression of training features that reduces storage and computation with little impact to model accuracy. Our methods are validated with experiments that test flexibility of learning and inference. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/AnytimeCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian-Yi Zhou, Matthew Lau, Jizhou Chen, Wenke Lee, Xiaoming Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem in many application areas, such as network security. Many deep learning methods for unsupervised anomaly detection produce good empirical performance but lack theoretical guarantees. By casting anomaly detection into a binary classification problem, we establish non-asymptotic upper bounds and a convergence rate on the excess risk on rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks trained on synthetic anomalies. Our convergence rate on the excess risk matches the minimax optimal rate in the literature. Furthermore, we provide lower and upper bounds on the number of synthetic anomalies that can attain this optimality. For practical implementation, we relax some conditions to improve the search for the empirical risk minimizer, which leads to competitive performance to other classification-based methods for anomaly detection. Overall, our work provides the first theoretical guarantees of unsupervised neural network-based anomaly detectors and empirical insights on how to design them well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Condran, Michael Bewong, Selasi Kwashie, Md Zahidul Islam, Irfan Altas, Joshua Condran</p>
<p>Abstract: The automated detection of false information has become a fundamental task in combating the spread of "fake news" on online social media networks (OSMN) as it reduces the need for manual discernment by individuals. In the literature, leveraging various content or context features of OSMN documents have been found useful. However, most of the existing detection models often utilise these features in isolation without regard to the temporal and dynamic changes oft-seen in reality, thus, limiting the robustness of the models. Furthermore, there has been little to no consideration of the impact of the quality of documents' features on the trustworthiness of the final prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework, called MAPX, which allows evidence based aggregation of predictions from existing models in an explainable manner. Indeed, the developed aggregation method is adaptive, dynamic and considers the quality of OSMN document features. Further, we perform extensive experiments on benchmarked fake news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPX using various real-world data quality scenarios. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models evaluated. For reproducibility, a demo of MAPX is available at \href{https://github.com/SCondran/MAPX_framework}{this link}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Zhu, Zehao Dou, Haoxin Zheng, Yasi Zhang, Ying Nian Wu, Ruiqi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as a strong prior for solving inverse problems. A prominent example is Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), which approximates the posterior distribution of data given the measure using Tweedie's formula. Despite the merits of being versatile in solving various inverse problems without re-training, the performance of DPS is hindered by the fact that this posterior approximation can be inaccurate especially for high noise levels. Therefore, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}osterior \textbf{MC}MC (\textbf{DPMC}), a novel inference algorithm based on Annealed MCMC to solve inverse problems with pretrained diffusion models. We define a series of intermediate distributions inspired by the approximated conditional distributions used by DPS. Through annealed MCMC sampling, we encourage the samples to follow each intermediate distribution more closely before moving to the next distribution at a lower noise level, and therefore reduce the accumulated error along the path. We test our algorithm in various inverse problems, including super resolution, Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, inpainting, and phase retrieval. Our algorithm outperforms DPS with less number of evaluations across nearly all tasks, and is competitive among existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Sharad Pomaje, Rajshekhar V Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, low latency often necessitates short-length codewords that either do not use channel state information (CSI) or rely solely on CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Gaussian codes that achieve capacity for AWGN channels may be unsuitable for these no-CSI and CSIR-only cases. In this work, we design short-length codewords for these cases using an autoencoder architecture. From the designed codes, we observe the following: In the no-CSI case, the learned codes are mutually orthogonal when the distribution of the real and imaginary parts of the fading random variable has support over the entire real line. However, when the support is limited to the non-negative real line, the codes are not mutually orthogonal. For the CSIR-only case, deep learning-based codes designed for AWGN channels perform worse in fading channels with optimal coherent detection compared to codes specifically designed for fading channels with CSIR, where the autoencoder jointly learns encoding, coherent combining, and decoding. In both no-CSI and CSIR-only cases, the codes perform at least as well as or better than classical codes of the same block length.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as 4D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a challenging task that requires tailored hardware accelerator architectures and a clear understanding of their performance characteristics when executing the intended AI workload. To facilitate this, we present an automated generation approach for fast performance models to accurately estimate the latency of a DNN mapped onto systematically modeled and concisely described accelerator architectures. Using our accelerator architecture description method, we modeled representative DNN accelerators such as Gemmini, UltraTrail, Plasticine-derived, and a parameterizable systolic array. Together with DNN mappings for those modeled architectures, we perform a combined DNN/hardware dependency graph analysis, which enables us, in the best case, to evaluate only 154 loop kernel iterations to estimate the performance for 4.19 billion instructions achieving a significant speedup. We outperform regression and analytical models in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to simulation results, while being several magnitudes faster than an RTL simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Etor Arza, Frank Veenstra, T{\o}nnes F. Nygaard, Kyrre Glette</p>
<p>Abstract: The design (shape) of a robot is usually decided before the control is implemented. This might limit how well the design is adapted to a task, as the suitability of the design is given by how well the robot performs in the task, which requires both a design and a controller. The co-optimization or simultaneous optimization of the design and control of robots addresses this limitation by producing a design and control that are both adapted to the task. In this paper, we investigate some of the challenges inherent in the co-optimization of design and control. We show that retraining the controller of a robot with additional resources after the co-optimization process terminates significantly improves the robot's performance. In addition, we demonstrate that the resources allocated to training the controller for each design influence the design complexity, where simpler designs are associated with lower training budgets. The experimentation is conducted in four publicly available simulation environments for co-optimization of design and control, making the findings more applicable to the general case. The results presented in this paper hope to guide other practitioners in the co-optimization of design and control of robots.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08642">CPL: Critical Planning Step Learning Boosts LLM Generalization in Reasoning Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianlong Wang, Xueting Han, Jing Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training large language models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities has proven effective across diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on improving task-specific reasoning but have not adequately addressed the model's generalization capabilities across a broader range of reasoning tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Critical Planning Step Learning (CPL), which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse planning steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. Based on long-term outcomes, CPL learns step-level planning preferences to improve the model's planning capabilities and, consequently, its general reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, while effective in many scenarios for aligning LLMs, existing preference learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to their inability to capture fine-grained supervision at each step. We propose Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates an advantage estimate for step-level preference pairs obtained via MCTS into the DPO. This enables the model to more effectively learn critical intermediate planning steps, thereby further improving its generalization in reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as ARC-C (+4.0%), BBH (+1.8%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and MMLU (+0.9%).</p>

This methodology builds upon the foundation of L-MAC, Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers, a method that produces faithful and listenable explanations. We incorporate SepFormer, a popular transformer-based time-domain source separation architecture. We show through a user study that LMAC-TD significantly improves the audio quality of the produced explanations while not sacrificing from faithfulness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most of the prevalent approaches in speech prosody modeling rely on learning global style representations in a continuous latent space which encode and transfer the attributes of reference speech. However, recent work on neural codecs which are based on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) already shows great potential offering distinct advantages. We investigate the prosody modeling capabilities of the discrete space of such an RVQ-VAE model, modifying it to operate on the phoneme-level. We condition both the encoder and decoder of the model on linguistic representations and apply a global speaker embedding in order to factor out both phonetic and speaker information. We conduct an extensive set of investigations based on subjective experiments and objective measures to show that the phoneme-level discrete latent representations obtained this way achieves a high degree of disentanglement, capturing fine-grained prosodic information that is robust and transferable. The latent space turns out to have interpretable structure with its principal components corresponding to pitch and energy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Acoustic identification of individual animals (AIID) is closely related to audio-based species classification but requires a finer level of detail to distinguish between individual animals within the same species. In this work, we frame AIID as a hierarchical multi-label classification task and propose the use of hierarchy-aware loss functions to learn robust representations of individual identities that maintain the hierarchical relationships among species and taxa. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical embeddings not only enhance identification accuracy at the individual level but also at higher taxonomic levels, effectively preserving the hierarchical structure in the learned representations. By comparing our approach with non-hierarchical models, we highlight the advantage of enforcing this structure in the embedding space. Additionally, we extend the evaluation to the classification of novel individual classes, demonstrating the potential of our method in open-set classification scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Niu, Qimao Chen, Tenglong Liu, Jianxiong Li, Guyue Zhou, Yi Zhang, Jianming Hu, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reusing pre-collected data from different domains is an attractive solution in decision-making tasks where the accessible data is insufficient in the target domain but relatively abundant in other related domains. Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p>

Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context.

The cyber scores are unrelated to other firms' characteristics. Stocks with high cyber scores significantly outperform other stocks. The long-short cyber risk factors have positive risk premia, are robust to all factors' benchmarks, and help price returns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raul Ramos-Pollan, Freddie Kalaitzis, Karthick Panner Selvam</p>
<p>Abstract: We take the perspective in which we want to design a downstream task (such as estimating vegetation coverage) on a certain area of interest (AOI) with a limited labeling budget. By leveraging an existing Foundation Model (FM) we must decide whether we train a downstream model on a different but label-rich AOI hoping it generalizes to our AOI, or we split labels in our AOI for training and validating. In either case, we face choices concerning what FM to use, how to sample our AOI for labeling, etc. which affect both the performance and uncertainty of the results. In this work, we perform a large ablative study using eight existing FMs on either Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 as input data, and the classes from the ESA World Cover product as downstream tasks across eleven AOIs. We do repeated sampling and training, resulting in an ablation of some 500K simple linear regression models. Our results show both the limits of spatial generalizability across AOIs and the power of FMs where we are able to get over 0.9 correlation coefficient between predictions and targets on different chip level predictive tasks. And still, performance and uncertainty vary greatly across AOIs, tasks and FMs. We believe this is a key issue in practice, because there are many design decisions behind each FM and downstream task (input modalities, sampling, architectures, pretraining, etc.) and usually a downstream task designer is aware of and can decide upon a few of them. Through this work, we advocate for the usage of the methodology herein described (large ablations on reference global labels and simple probes), both when publishing new FMs, and to make informed decisions when designing downstream tasks to use them.</p>

For the past three years, we have integrated energy consumption metrics into the evaluation of sound event detection (SED) systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of this energy criterion on the challenge results and explore the evolution of system complexity and energy consumption over the years. We highlight a shift towards more energy-efficient approaches during training without compromising performance, while the number of operations and system complexity continue to grow. Through this analysis, we hope to promote more environmentally friendly practices within the SED community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonah Botvinick-Greenhouse, Maria Oprea, Romit Maulik, Yunan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The celebrated Takens' embedding theorem provides a theoretical foundation for reconstructing the full state of a dynamical system from partial observations. However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we rigorously establish a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between probability spaces. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transportation theory. Building on our novel measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we have developed a new computational framework that forecasts the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with better robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our approach through several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to large-scale, real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature forecasting and ERA5 wind field reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Seifert, Onur G\"unl\"u, Rafael F. Schaefer</p>
<p>Abstract: The wiretap channel is a well-studied problem in the physical layer security (PLS) literature. Although it is proven that the decoding error probability and information leakage can be made arbitrarily small in the asymptotic regime, further research on finite-blocklength codes is required on the path towards practical, secure communications systems. This work provides the first experimental characterization of a deep learning-based, finite-blocklength code construction for multi-tap fading wiretap channels without channel state information (CSI). In addition to the evaluation of the average probability of error and information leakage, we illustrate the influence of (i) the number of fading taps, (ii) differing variances of the fading coefficients and (iii) the seed selection for the hash function-based security layer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Lancho, Amir Weiss, Gary C. F. Lee, Tejas Jayashankar, Binoy Kurien, Yury Polyanskiy, Gregory W. Wornell</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a novel, data-driven approach that leverages state-of-the-art AI models. Traditionally, interference rejection algorithms are manually tailored to specific types of interference. This work introduces a more scalable data-driven solution and contains the following contributions. First, we present an insightful signal model that serves as a foundation for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. Second, we introduce the RF Challenge, a publicly available dataset featuring diverse RF signals along with code templates, which facilitates data-driven analysis of RF signal problems. Third, we propose novel AI-based rejection algorithms, specifically architectures like UNet and WaveNet, and evaluate their performance across eight different signal mixture types. These models demonstrate superior performance exceeding traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation by up to two orders of magnitude in bit-error rate. Fourth, we summarize the results from an open competition hosted at 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024) based on the RF Challenge, highlighting the significant potential for continued advancements in this area. Our findings underscore the promise of deep learning algorithms in mitigating interference, offering a strong foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhua Xu, Wenpeng Xing, Zhebo Wang, Chang Hu, Chen Jie, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data. As a result, protecting the intellectual property of these models through fingerprinting is essential for ownership authentication. While adding fingerprints to LLMs through fine-tuning has been attempted, it remains costly and unscalable. In this paper, we introduce FP-VEC, a pilot study on using fingerprint vectors as an efficient fingerprinting method for LLMs. Our approach generates a fingerprint vector that represents a confidential signature embedded in the model, allowing the same fingerprint to be seamlessly incorporated into an unlimited number of LLMs via vector addition. Results on several LLMs show that FP-VEC is lightweight by running on CPU-only devices for fingerprinting, scalable with a single training and unlimited fingerprinting process, and preserves the model's normal behavior.

<p>Abstract: Recently, through development of several 3d vision systems, widely used in various applications, medical and biometric fields. Microsoft kinect sensor have been most of used camera among 3d vision systems. Microsoft kinect sensor can obtain depth images of a scene and 3d coordinates of human joints. Thus, anthropometric features can extractable easily. Anthropometric feature and 3d joint coordinate raw datas which captured from kinect sensor is unstable. The strongest reason for this, datas vary by distance between joints of individual and location of kinect sensor. Consequently, usage of this datas without kinect calibration and data optimization does not result in sufficient and healthy. In this study, proposed a novel method to calibrating kinect sensor and optimizing skeleton features. Results indicate that the proposed method is quite effective and worthy of further study in more general scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Smeu, Elisabeta Oneata, Dan Oneata</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models can create entirely new images, but they can also partially modify real images in ways that are undetectable to the human eye. In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically detecting such local manipulations. One of the most pressing problems in deepfake detection remains the ability of models to generalize to different classes of generators. In the case of fully manipulated images, representations extracted from large self-supervised models (such as CLIP) provide a promising direction towards more robust detectors. Here, we introduce DeCLIP, a first attempt to leverage such large pretrained features for detecting local manipulations. We show that, when combined with a reasonably large convolutional decoder, pretrained self-supervised representations are able to perform localization and improve generalization capabilities over existing methods. Unlike previous work, our approach is able to perform localization on the challenging case of latent diffusion models, where the entire image is affected by the fingerprint of the generator. Moreover, we observe that this type of data, which combines local semantic information with a global fingerprint, provides more stable generalization than other categories of generative methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Are general-purpose visual representations acquired solely from synthetic data useful for detecting fake images? In this work, we show the effectiveness of synthetic data-driven representations for synthetic image detection. Upon analysis, we find that vision transformers trained by the latest visual representation learners with synthetic data can effectively distinguish fake from real images without seeing any real images during pre-training. Notably, using SynCLR as the backbone in a state-of-the-art detection method demonstrates a performance improvement of +10.32 mAP and +4.73% accuracy over the widely used CLIP, when tested on previously unseen GAN models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yao, Wentao He, Chenyu Gu, Jiaheng Du, Fuwei Tan, Zhen Zhu, Junguo Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Hornung (Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany, Munich Center for Machine Learning), Alexander Hapfelmeier (Institute of AI and Informatics in Medicine, TUM School of Medicine and Health, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany)</p>
<p>Abstract: In prediction tasks with multi-class outcomes, identifying covariates specifically associated with one or more outcome classes can be important. Conventional variable importance measures (VIMs) from random forests (RFs), like permutation and Gini importance, focus on overall predictive performance or node purity, without differentiating between the classes. Therefore, they can be expected to fail to distinguish class-associated covariates from covariates that only distinguish between groups of classes. We introduce a VIM called multi-class VIM, tailored for identifying exclusively class-associated covariates, via a novel RF variant called multi forests (MuFs). The trees in MuFs use both multi-way and binary splitting. The multi-way splits generate child nodes for each class, using a split criterion that evaluates how well these nodes represent their respective classes. This setup forms the basis of the multi-class VIM, which measures the discriminatory ability of the splits performed in the respective covariates with regard to this split criterion. Alongside the multi-class VIM, we introduce a second VIM, the discriminatory VIM. This measure, based on the binary splits, assesses the strength of the general influence of the covariates, irrespective of their class-associatedness. Simulation studies demonstrate that the multi-class VIM specifically ranks class-associated covariates highly, unlike conventional VIMs which also rank other types of covariates highly. Analyses of 121 datasets reveal that MuFs often have slightly lower predictive performance compared to conventional RFs. This is, however, not a limiting factor given the algorithm's primary purpose of calculating the multi-class VIM.</p>

Our approach is organized in two steps: k-means clustering is used for prior elicitation, then proper Bayesian bootstrap is applied as resampling method in an ensemble clustering approach. Results are analyzed introducing measures of uncertainty based on Shannon entropy. The proposal provides clear indication on the optimal number of clusters, as well as a better representation of the clustered data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Kaufman, Emi Lee, Manas Satish Bedmutha, David Kirsh, Nadir Weibel</p>
<p>Abstract: Low trust remains a significant barrier to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption. To design trustworthy AVs, we need to better understand the individual traits, attitudes, and experiences that impact people's trust judgements. We use machine learning to understand the most important factors that contribute to young adult trust based on a comprehensive set of personal factors gathered via survey (n = 1457). Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person's mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Li Xinyuan, Sonal Joshi, Thomas Thebaud, Jesus Villalba, Najim Dehak, Sanjeev Khudanpur</p>
<p>Abstract: Poisoning backdoor attacks involve an adversary manipulating the training data to induce certain behaviors in the victim model by inserting a trigger in the signal at inference time. We adapted clean label backdoor (CLBD)-data poisoning attacks, which do not modify the training labels, on state-of-the-art speech recognition models that support/perform a Spoken Language Understanding task, achieving 99.8% attack success rate by poisoning 10% of the training data. We analyzed how varying the signal-strength of the poison, percent of samples poisoned, and choice of trigger impact the attack. We also found that CLBD attacks are most successful when applied to training samples that are inherently hard for a proxy model. Using this strategy, we achieved an attack success rate of 99.3% by poisoning a meager 1.5% of the training data. Finally, we applied two previously developed defenses against gradient-based attacks, and found that they attain mixed success against poisoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Lu, Hemant Ishwaran</p>
<p>Abstract: While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics, and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification, and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show, among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Kundu, Yanzi Jin, Mohammad Sekhavat, Max Horton, Danny Tormoen, Devang Naik</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper delves into the challenging task of Active Speaker Detection (ASD), where the system needs to determine in real-time whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. While previous works have made significant strides in improving network architectures and learning effective representations for ASD, a critical gap exists in the exploration of real-time system deployment. Existing models often suffer from high latency and memory usage, rendering them impractical for immediate applications. To bridge this gap, we present two scenarios that address the key challenges posed by real-time constraints. First, we introduce a method to limit the number of future context frames utilized by the ASD model. By doing so, we alleviate the need for processing the entire sequence of future frames before a decision is made, significantly reducing latency. Second, we propose a more stringent constraint that limits the total number of past frames the model can access during inference. This tackles the persistent memory issues associated with running streaming ASD systems. Beyond these theoretical frameworks, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate that constrained transformer models can achieve performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art recurrent models, such as uni-directional GRUs, with a significantly reduced number of context frames. Moreover, we shed light on the temporal memory requirements of ASD systems, revealing that larger past context has a more profound impact on accuracy than future context. When profiling on a CPU we find that our efficient architecture is memory bound by the amount of past context it can use and that the compute cost is negligible as compared to the memory cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Chen, Haiyong Luo, Fang Zhao, Xuechun Meng, Zhiqing Xie, Yida Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inertial sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is the base of many human-centered mobile applications. Deep learning-based fine-grained HAR models enable accurate classification in various complex application scenarios. Nevertheless, the large storage and computational overhead of the existing fine-grained deep HAR models hinder their widespread deployment on resource-limited platforms. Inspired by the knowledge distillation's reasonable model compression and potential performance improvement capability, we design a multi-level HAR modeling pipeline called Stage-Logits-Memory Distillation (SMLDist) based on the widely-used MobileNet. By paying more attention to the frequency-related features during the distillation process, the SMLDist improves the HAR classification robustness of the students. We also propose an auto-search mechanism in the heterogeneous classifiers to improve classification performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SMLDist outperforms various state-of-the-art HAR frameworks in accuracy and F1 macro score. The practical evaluation of the Jetson Xavier AGX platform shows that the SMLDist model is both energy-efficient and computation-efficient. These experiments validate the reasonable balance between the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model. The comparative experiments of knowledge distillation on six public datasets also demonstrate that the SMLDist outperforms other advanced knowledge distillation methods of students' performance, which verifies the good generalization of the SMLDist on other classification tasks, including but not limited to HAR.</p>

Although there is no universally accepted definition of the concepts encoded by a DNN, the sparsity of interactions in a DNN has been proved, i.e., the output score of a DNN can be well explained by a small number of interactions between input variables. In this way, to some extent, we can consider such interactions as interactive concepts encoded by the DNN. Therefore, in this paper, we derive an analytic explanation of inconsistency of concepts of different complexities. This may shed new lights on using the generalization power of concepts to explain the generalization power of the entire DNN. Besides, we discover that the DNN with stronger generalization power usually learns simple concepts more quickly and encodes fewer complex concepts. We also discover the detouring dynamics of learning complex concepts, which explains both the high learning difficulty and the low generalization power of complex concepts. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Ren, Jiayang Gao, Wen Shen, Quanshi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to prove the emergence of symbolic concepts (or more precisely, sparse primitive inference patterns) in well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we prove the following three conditions for the emergence. (i) The high-order derivatives of the network output with respect to the input variables are all zero. (ii) The DNN can be used on occluded samples and when the input sample is less occluded, the DNN will yield higher confidence. (iii) The confidence of the DNN does not significantly degrade on occluded samples. These conditions are quite common, and we prove that under these conditions, the DNN will only encode a relatively small number of sparse interactions between input variables. Moreover, we can consider such interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN, because we show that inference scores of the DNN on an exponentially large number of randomly masked samples can always be well mimicked by numerical effects of just a few interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koen Minartz, Yoeri Poels, Simon Koop, Vlado Menkovski</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are emerging as a tool for scalable data-driven simulation of high-dimensional dynamical systems, especially in settings where numerical methods are infeasible or computationally expensive. Notably, it has been shown that incorporating domain symmetries in deterministic neural simulators can substantially improve their accuracy, sample efficiency, and parameter efficiency. However, to incorporate symmetries in probabilistic neural simulators that can simulate stochastic phenomena, we need a model that produces equivariant distributions over trajectories, rather than equivariant function approximations. In this paper, we propose Equivariant Probabilistic Neural Simulation (EPNS), a framework for autoregressive probabilistic modeling of equivariant distributions over system evolutions. We use EPNS to design models for a stochastic n-body system and stochastic cellular dynamics. Our results show that EPNS considerably outperforms existing neural network-based methods for probabilistic simulation. More specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating equivariance in EPNS improves simulation quality, data efficiency, rollout stability, and uncertainty quantification. We conclude that EPNS is a promising method for efficient and effective data-driven probabilistic simulation in a diverse range of domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongguang Wang, Guray Erus, Pratik Chaudhari, Christos Davatzikos</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise for revolutionizing a number of areas, including healthcare. However, it is also facing a reproducibility crisis, especially in medicine. ML models that are carefully constructed from and evaluated on a training set might not generalize well on data from different patient populations or acquisition instrument settings and protocols. We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g., subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc. using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Critically, our brain age prediction models lead to new clinical insights regarding correlations with neurophysiological tests.</p>

<p>Abstract: The intensive care unit (ICU) comprises a complex hospital environment, where decisions made by clinicians have a high level of risk for the patients' lives. A comprehensive care pathway must then be followed to reduce p complications. Uncertain, competing and unplanned aspects within this environment increase the difficulty in uniformly implementing the care pathway. Readmission contributes to this pathway's difficulty, occurring when patients are admitted again to the ICU in a short timeframe, resulting in high mortality rates and high resource utilisation. Several works have tried to predict readmission through patients' medical information. Although they have some level of success while predicting readmission, those works do not properly assess, characterise and understand readmission prediction. This work proposes a standardised and explainable machine learning pipeline to model patient readmission on a multicentric database (i.e., the eICU cohort with 166,355 patients, 200,859 admissions and 6,021 readmissions) while validating it on monocentric (i.e., the MIMIC IV cohort with 382,278 patients, 523,740 admissions and 5,984 readmissions) and multicentric settings. Our machine learning pipeline achieved predictive performance in terms of the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) up to 0.7 with a Random Forest classification model, yielding an overall good calibration and consistency on validation sets. From explanations provided by the constructed models, we could also derive a set of insightful conclusions, primarily on variables related to vital signs and blood tests (e.g., albumin, blood urea nitrogen and hemoglobin levels), demographics (e.g., age, and admission height and weight), and ICU-associated variables (e.g., unit type). These insights provide an invaluable source of information during clinicians' decision-making while discharging ICU patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Son Nguyen, Adam Wang, Albert Montillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep learning (DL) models face two key challenges. First, they assume training samples are independent and identically distributed, an assumption often violated in real-world datasets where samples are grouped by shared measurements (e.g., participants or cells). This leads to performance degradation, limited generalization, and confounding issues, causing Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Second, DL models typically prioritize overall accuracy, often overlooking fairness across underrepresented groups, leading to biased outcomes in critical areas such as loan approvals and healthcare decisions. To address these issues, we introduce the Fair Mixed Effects Deep Learning (Fair MEDL) framework. Fair MEDL quantifies cluster-invariant fixed effects (FE) and cluster-specific random effects (RE) through 1) a cluster adversary for learning invariant FE, 2) a Bayesian neural network for RE, and 3) a mixing function combining FE and RE for final predictions. Additionally, we incorporate adversarial debiasing to promote fairness across three key metrics: Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity, and Counterfactual Fairness. Our method also identifies and de-weights confounding probes, improving interpretability. Evaluated on three datasets from finance and healthcare, Fair MEDL improves fairness by up to 73% for age, 47% for race, 83% for sex, and 26% for marital status, while maintaining robust predictive performance. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohua Lu, Liangxu Xie, Lei Xu, Rongzhi Mao, Shan Chang, Xiaojun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting molecular properties is a challenging but essential task in drug discovery. Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information, Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively, which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabanus Derr, Robert C. Williamson</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is about forecasting. Forecasts, however, obtain their usefulness only through their evaluation. Machine learning has traditionally focused on types of losses and their corresponding regret. Currently, the machine learning community regained interest in calibration. In this work, we show the conceptual equivalence of calibration and regret in evaluating forecasts. We frame the evaluation problem as a game between a forecaster, a gambler and nature. Putting intuitive restrictions on gambler and forecaster, calibration and regret naturally fall out of the framework. In addition, this game links evaluation of forecasts to randomness of outcomes. Random outcomes with respect to forecasts are equivalent to good forecasts with respect to outcomes. We call those dual aspects, calibration and regret, predictiveness and randomness, the four facets of forecast felicity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Faithfully summarizing the knowledge encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) into a few symbolic primitive patterns without losing much information represents a core challenge in explainable AI. To this end, Ren et al. (2024) have derived a series of theorems to prove that the inference score of a DNN can be explained as a small set of interactions between input variables. However, the lack of generalization power makes it still hard to consider such interactions as faithful primitive patterns encoded by the DNN. Therefore, given different DNNs trained for the same task, we develop a new method to extract interactions that are shared by these DNNs. Experiments show that the extracted interactions can better reflect common knowledge shared by different DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfred Ferrer Florensa, Jose Juan Almagro Armenteros, Henrik Nielsen, Frank M{\o}ller Aarestrup, Philip Thomas Lanken Conradsen Clausen</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of deep learning models in computational biology has increased massively in recent years, and it is expected to continue with the current advances in the fields such as Natural Language Processing. These models, although able to draw complex relations between input and target, are also inclined to learn noisy deviations from the pool of data used during their development. In order to assess their performance on unseen data (their capacity to generalize), it is common to split the available data randomly into development (train/validation) and test sets. This procedure, although standard, has been shown to produce dubious assessments of generalization due to the existing similarity between samples in the databases used. In this work, we present SpanSeq, a database partition method for machine learning that can scale to most biological sequences (genes, proteins and genomes) in order to avoid data leakage between sets. We also explore the effect of not restraining similarity between sets by reproducing the development of two state-of-the-art models on bioinformatics, not only confirming the consequences of randomly splitting databases on the model assessment, but expanding those repercussions to the model development.

<p>Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) effectively aligns pretrained Large Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs, and VLMs) with human preferences, its computational cost and complexity hamper its wider adoption. To alleviate some of the computational burden of fine-tuning, parameter efficient methods, like LoRA were introduced. In this work, we empirically evaluate the setup of Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PE-RLHF) that leverages LoRA fine-tuning for Reward Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning. We benchmark the PE-RLHF setup on six diverse datasets spanning summarization, harmless/helpful response generation, UI automation, and visual question answering in terms of effectiveness of the trained models, and the training resources required. Our findings show, for the first time, that PE-RLHF achieves comparable performance to RLHF, while significantly reducing training time (up to 90% faster for reward models, and 30% faster for RL), and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models, and 27% for RL). We provide comprehensive ablations across LoRA ranks, and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning. By mitigating the computational burden associated with RLHF, we push for a broader adoption of PE-RLHF as an alignment technique for LLMs and VLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: To improve privacy and ensure quality-of-service (QoS), deep learning (DL) models are increasingly deployed on Internet of Things (IoT) devices for data processing, significantly increasing the carbon footprint associated with DL on IoT, covering both operational and embodied aspects. Existing operational energy predictors often overlook quantized DL models and emerging neural processing units (NPUs), while embodied carbon footprint modeling tools neglect non-computing hardware components common in IoT devices, creating a gap in accurate carbon footprint modeling tools for IoT-enabled DL. This paper introduces \textit{\carb}, an end-to-end tool for precise carbon footprint estimation in IoT-enabled DL, with deviations as low as 5\% for operational and 3.23\% for embodied carbon footprints compared to actual measurements across various DL models. Additionally, practical applications of \carb~are showcased through multiple user case studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Aminifar, Matin Shokri, Amir Aminifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are generally designed for scenarios in which all data is stored in one data center, where the training is performed. However, in many applications, e.g., in the healthcare domain, the training data is distributed among several entities, e.g., different hospitals or patients' mobile devices/sensors. At the same time, transferring the data to a central location for learning is certainly not an option, due to privacy concerns and legal issues, and in certain cases, because of the communication and computation overheads. Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art collaborative ML approach for training an ML model across multiple parties holding local data samples, without sharing them. However, enabling learning from distributed data over such edge Internet of Things (IoT) systems (e.g., mobile-health and wearable technologies, involving sensitive personal/medical data) in a privacy-preserving fashion presents a major challenge mainly due to their stringent resource constraints, i.e., limited computing capacity, communication bandwidth, memory storage, and battery lifetime. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge FL framework for resource-constrained mobile-health and wearable technologies over the IoT infrastructure. We evaluate our proposed framework extensively and provide the implementation of our technique on Amazon's AWS cloud platform based on the seizure detection application in epilepsy monitoring using wearable technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei He, Zhenyu Hou, Yukuo Cen, Feng He, Xu Cheng, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Qian, Bingyu Xie, Biao Wan, Minhao Li, Miao Sun, Patrick Yin Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of decision-making systems, which can be particularly important in domains like autonomous driving, healthcare, and, notably, robotics. Recent approaches focus on learning in the data space to model time series information. However, the data space often contains limited observations and noisy features. In this paper, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and real-world datasets and benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. For example, TimeLDM achieves new state-of-the-art results on the simulated benchmarks and an average improvement of 55% in Discriminative score with all benchmarks. Further studies demonstrate that our method yields more robust outcomes across various lengths of time series data generation. Especially, for the Context-FID score and Discriminative score, TimeLDM realizes significant improvements of 80% and 50%, respectively. The code will be released after publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Qian, Miao Sun, Sifan Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Ruizhi Hun, Patrick Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose Sub-SA (Submodular Selective Annotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose RPR (Reward and Penalty Regularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a crucial tool in network anomaly detection (NAD) for cybersecurity. While DL models for anomaly detection excel at extracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to data contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in training sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six unsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed evaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated data, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based NAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder with a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more densely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals that this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design \textbf{STformer} achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant \textbf{NSTformer} based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Mai, Yu Zhao, Ying Zeng, Jianhua Yao, Haifeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to effectively integrate information from various sources to infer sentiment, where in many cases there are no annotations for unimodal labels. Therefore, most works rely on multimodal labels for training. However, there exists the noisy label problem for the learning of unimodal signals as multimodal annotations are not always the ideal substitutes for the unimodal ones, failing to achieve finer optimization for individual modalities. In this paper, we explore the learning of unimodal labels under the weak supervision from the annotated multimodal labels. Specifically, we propose a novel meta uni-label generation (MUG) framework to address the above problem, which leverages the available multimodal labels to learn the corresponding unimodal labels by the meta uni-label correction network (MUCN). We first design a contrastive-based projection module to bridge the gap between unimodal and multimodal representations, so as to use multimodal annotations to guide the learning of MUCN. Afterwards, we propose unimodal and multimodal denoising tasks to train MUCN with explicit supervision via a bi-level optimization strategy. We then jointly train unimodal and multimodal learning tasks to extract discriminative unimodal features for multimodal inference. Experimental results suggest that MUG outperforms competitive baselines and can learn accurate unimodal labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moosa Saghir, N. R. Raghavendra, Zihe Liu, Evan Ryan Gunter</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of free parameters, or dimension, of a model is a straightforward way to measure its complexity: a model with more parameters can encode more information. However, this is not an accurate measure of complexity: models capable of memorizing their training data often generalize well despite their high dimension. Effective dimension aims to more directly capture the complexity of a model by counting only the number of parameters required to represent the functionality of the model. Singular learning theory (SLT) proposes the learning coefficient $ \lambda $ as a more accurate measure of effective dimension. By describing the rate of increase of the volume of the region of parameter space around a local minimum with respect to loss, $ \lambda $ incorporates information from higher-order terms. We compare $ \lambda $ of models trained using natural gradient descent (NGD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and find that those trained with NGD consistently have a higher effective dimension for both of our methods: the Hessian trace $ \text{Tr}(\mathbf{H}) $, and the estimate of the local learning coefficient (LLC) $ \hat{\lambda}(w^*) $.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakeel A. Sheikh, Yacouba Kaloga, Ina Kodrasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the promising performance of state of the art approaches for Parkinsons Disease (PD) detection, these approaches often analyze individual speech segments in isolation, which can lead to suboptimal results. Dysarthric cues that characterize speech impairments from PD patients are expected to be related across segments from different speakers. Isolated segment analysis fails to exploit these inter segment relationships. Additionally, not all speech segments from PD patients exhibit clear dysarthric symptoms, introducing label noise that can negatively affect the performance and generalizability of current approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel PD detection framework utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing speech segments as nodes and capturing the similarity between segments through edges, our GCN model facilitates the aggregation of dysarthric cues across the graph, effectively exploiting segment relationships and mitigating the impact of label noise. Experimental results demonstrate theadvantages of the proposed GCN model for PD detection and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian processes are arguably the most important class of spatiotemporal models within machine learning.

In many applications, particularly in physical sciences and engineering, but also in areas such as geostatistics and neuroscience, invariance to symmetries is one of the most fundamental forms of prior information one can consider.

In this work, we develop constructive and practical techniques for building stationary Gaussian processes on a very large class of non-Euclidean spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our techniques make it possible to (i) calculate covariance kernels and (ii) sample from prior and posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces, both in a practical manner. This work is split into two parts, each involving different technical considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while part II studies non-compact spaces possessing certain structure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namhoon Cho, Hyo-Sang Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a constructive methodology for designing accelerated convex optimisation algorithms in continuous-time domain. The two key enablers are the classical concept of passivity in control theory and the time-dependent change of variables that maps the output of the internal dynamic system to the optimisation variables. The Lyapunov function associated with the optimisation dynamics is obtained as a natural consequence of specifying the internal dynamics that drives the state evolution as a passive linear time-invariant system. The passivity-based methodology provides a general framework that has the flexibility to generate convex optimisation algorithms with the guarantee of different convergence rate bounds on the objective function value. The same principle applies to the design of online parameter update algorithms for adaptive control by re-defining the output of internal dynamics to allow for the feedback interconnection with tracking error dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akinari Onishi</p>
<p>Abstract: The reinforcement learning algorithms have often been applied to social robots. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms were not optimized for the use of social robots, and consequently they may bore users. We proposed a new reinforcement learning method specialized for the social robot, the FRAC-Q-learning, that can avoid user boredom. The proposed algorithm consists of a forgetting process in addition to randomizing and categorizing processes. This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional Q-learning. Therefore, the FRAC-Q-learning can contribute to develop a social robot that will not bore users. The proposed algorithm has a potential to apply for Web-based communication and educational systems. This paper presents the entire process, detailed implementation and a detailed evaluation method of the of the FRAC-Q-learning for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaran Chen, Wenbo Cui, Yuanwen Chen, Mining Tan, Xinyao Zhang, Dongbin Zhao, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menouar Azib, Benjamin Renard, Philippe Garnier, Vincent G\'enot, Nicolas Andr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Event detection in time series is a challenging task due to the prevalence of imbalanced datasets, rare events, and time interval-defined events. Traditional supervised deep learning methods primarily employ binary classification, where each time step is assigned a binary label indicating the presence or absence of an event. However, these methods struggle to handle these specific scenarios effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel supervised regression-based deep learning approach that offers several advantages over classification-based methods. Our approach, with a limited number of parameters, can effectively handle various types of events within a unified framework, including rare events and imbalanced datasets. We provide theoretical justifications for its universality and precision and demonstrate its superior performance across diverse domains, particularly for rare events and imbalanced datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gan Yuan, Mingyue Xu, Samory Kpotufe, Daniel Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) for multi-index models. The estimators of the central mean subspace in prior works either have slow (non-parametric) convergence rates, or rely on stringent distributional conditions (e.g., the covariate distribution $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ being elliptical symmetric). In this paper, we show that a fast parametric convergence rate of form $C_d \cdot n^{-1/2}$ is achievable via estimating the \emph{expected smoothed gradient outer product}, for a general class of distribution $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ admitting Gaussian or heavier distributions. When the link function is a polynomial with a degree of at most $r$ and $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ is the standard Gaussian, we show that the prefactor depends on the ambient dimension $d$ as $C_d \propto d^r$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusu Hong, Junhong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we revisit the convergence of AdaGrad with momentum (covering AdaGrad as a special case) on non-convex smooth optimization problems. We consider a general noise model where the noise magnitude is controlled by the function value gap together with the gradient magnitude. This model encompasses a broad range of noises including bounded noise, sub-Gaussian noise, affine variance noise and the expected smoothness, and it has been shown to be more realistic in many practical applications. Our analysis yields a probabilistic convergence rate which, under the general noise, could reach at (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})). This rate does not rely on prior knowledge of problem-parameters and could accelerate to (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T)) where (T) denotes the total number iterations, when the noise parameters related to the function value gap and noise level are sufficiently small. The convergence rate thus matches the lower rate for stochastic first-order methods over non-convex smooth landscape up to logarithm terms [Arjevani et al., 2023]. We further derive a convergence bound for AdaGrad with mometum, considering the generalized smoothness where the local smoothness is controlled by a first-order function of the gradient norm.</p>

<p>Abstract: As federated learning gains increasing importance in real-world applications due to its capacity for decentralized data training, addressing fairness concerns across demographic groups becomes critically important. However, most existing machine learning algorithms for ensuring fairness are designed for centralized data environments and generally require large-sample and distributional assumptions, underscoring the urgent need for fairness techniques adapted for decentralized and heterogeneous systems with finite-sample and distribution-free guarantees. To address this issue, this paper introduces FedFaiREE, a post-processing algorithm developed specifically for distribution-free fair learning in decentralized settings with small samples. Our approach accounts for unique challenges in decentralized environments, such as client heterogeneity, communication costs, and small sample sizes. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for both fairness and accuracy, and our experimental results further provide robust empirical validation for our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains a challenge. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp iteratively improves test coverage, interleaving coverage analysis with dialogs with the LLM that steer it to refine tests so that they increase coverage of lines and branches. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects, and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We show that CoverUp's iterative, coverage-guided approach is crucial to its effectiveness, contributing to nearly 40% of its successes.</p>

Moreover, it delineates sufficient conditions, contingent upon the adequacy of entropy regularization, for the uniqueness of the NE within the game. As Policy Optimization serves as a foundational approach for Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques aimed at finding the NE, in this work we prove the linear convergence of a policy optimization algorithm which (subject to the adequacy of entropy regularization) is capable of provably attaining the NE. Furthermore, in scenarios where the entropy regularization proves insufficient, we present a $\delta$-augmentation technique, which facilitates the achievement of an $\epsilon$-NE within the game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behnam Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting possibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with potential applications in various domains, including marketing research and consumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term "token noise" effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesca Lucchetti, Arjun Guha</p>
<p>Abstract: CodeLLMs are transforming software development as we know it. This is especially true for tasks where rule-based approaches fall short, like type prediction. The type prediction task consists in adding a new type annotation to a partially typed program, such that the resulting program is closer to being fully typed. The intractability of rule-based approaches and high cost of manual annotation make CodeLLMs an attractive solution to the problem. However, CodeLLMs are still far from being deployed on the large-scale due to doubts surrounding their reliability.
  To shed some light on how CodeLLMs approach type prediction, we investigate what happens when a model mispredicts a type. We show that by applying semantics-preserving edits to code, CodeLLMs are eventually misled into mispredicting type annotations. However, by leveraging activation steering we are able to "steer" the model back to the correct prediction, making models more robust against semantically irrelevant prompt features. We show that steering achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning directly on the type prediction task. Furthermore, we find that steering vectors computed from Python code are effective at correcting TypeScript mispredictions, and vice versa. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of its kind to suggest that CodeLLMs learn task representations that transfer across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iqra Bano, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyridon Chavlis, Panayiota Poirazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. These advantages are likely the result of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes in dendritic ANNs respond to multiple classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of dendritic properties can make learning in ANNs more precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mauricio Lima, Katherine Deck, Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Tapio Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics based model. Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksander Plocharski, Jan Swidzinski, Joanna Porter-Sobieraj, Przemyslaw Musialski</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic transformer-based model that converts flat, segmented facade structures into procedural definitions using a custom-designed split grammar. To facilitate this, we first develop a semi-complex split grammar tailored for architectural facades and then generate a dataset comprising of facades alongside their corresponding procedural representations. This dataset is used to train our transformer model to convert segmented, flat facades into the procedural language of our grammar. During inference, the model applies this learned transformation to new facade segmentations, providing a procedural representation that users can adjust to generate varied facade designs. This method not only automates the conversion of static facade images into dynamic, editable procedural formats but also enhances the design flexibility, allowing for easy modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Li, Yifan Wang, Zhongshuo Lin, Hehu Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a tensor neural network (TNN) to address nonparametric regression problems, leveraging its distinct sub-network structure to effectively facilitate variable separation and enhance the approximation of complex, high-dimensional functions. The TNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBN) in terms of both approximation accuracy and generalization capacity, even with a comparable number of parameters. A significant innovation in our approach is the integration of statistical regression and numerical integration within the TNN framework. This allows for efficient computation of high-dimensional integrals associated with the regression function and provides detailed insights into the underlying data structure. Furthermore, we employ gradient and Laplacian analysis on the regression outputs to identify key dimensions influencing the predictions, thereby guiding the design of subsequent experiments. These advancements make TNN a powerful tool for applications requiring precise high-dimensional data analysis and predictive modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisabeta-Iulia Dima, Pablo G\'omez, Sandor Kruk, Peter Kretschmar, Simon Rosen, C\u{a}lin-Adrian Popa</p>
<p>Abstract: Reflected or scattered light produce artefacts in astronomical observations that can negatively impact the scientific study. Hence, automated detection of these artefacts is highly beneficial, especially with the increasing amounts of data gathered. Machine learning methods are well-suited to this problem, but currently there is a lack of annotated data to train such approaches to detect artefacts in astronomical observations. In this work, we present a dataset of images from the XMM-Newton space telescope Optical Monitoring camera showing different types of artefacts. We hand-annotated a sample of 1000 images with artefacts which we use to train automated ML methods. We further demonstrate techniques tailored for accurate detection and masking of artefacts using instance segmentation. We adopt a hybrid approach, combining knowledge from both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models and use their advantages in segmentation. The presented method and dataset will advance artefact detection in astronomical observations by providing a reproducible baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iqra Bano, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous embedded systems (e.g., robots) typically necessitate intelligent computation with low power/energy processing for completing their tasks. Such requirements can be fulfilled by embodied neuromorphic intelligence with spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their high learning quality (e.g., accuracy) and sparse computation. Here, the employment of event-based data is preferred to ensure seamless connectivity between input and processing parts. However, state-of-the-art SNNs still face a long training time to achieve high accuracy, thereby incurring high energy consumption and producing a high rate of carbon emission. Toward this, we propose FastSpiker, a novel methodology that enables fast SNN training on event-based data through learning rate enhancements targeting autonomous embedded systems. In FastSpiker, we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values, then select the ones that quickly offer high accuracy. Afterward, we explore different settings for the selected learning rate policies to find the appropriate policies through a statistical-based decision. Experimental results show that our FastSpiker offers up to 10.5x faster training time and up to 88.39% lower carbon emission to achieve higher or comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art on the event-based automotive dataset (i.e., NCARS). In this manner, our FastSpiker methodology paves the way for green and sustainable computing in realizing embodied neuromorphic intelligence for autonomous embedded systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyuan Zhao, Bojan Radoji\v{c}i\'c, Gunjan Verma, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce the latency of Backpressure (BP) routing in wireless multi-hop networks, we propose to enhance the existing shortest path-biased BP (SP-BP) and sojourn time-based backlog metrics, since they introduce no additional time step-wise signaling overhead to the basic BP. Rather than relying on hop-distance, we introduce a new edge-weighted shortest path bias built on the scheduling duty cycle of wireless links, which can be predicted by a graph convolutional neural network based on the topology and traffic of wireless networks. Additionally, we tackle three long-standing challenges associated with SP-BP: optimal bias scaling, efficient bias maintenance, and integration of delay awareness. Our proposed solutions inherit the throughput optimality of the basic BP, as well as its practical advantages of low complexity and fully distributed implementation. Our approaches rely on common link features and introduces only a one-time constant overhead to previous SP-BP schemes, or a one-time overhead linear in the network size to the basic BP. Numerical experiments show that our solutions can effectively address the major drawbacks of slow startup, random walk, and the last packet problem in basic BP, improving the end-to-end delay of existing low-overhead BP algorithms under various settings of network traffic, interference, and mobility.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665">Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Ganesh, Ihsan Ibrahim Daldaban, Ignacio Cofone, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Model multiplicity, the phenomenon where multiple models achieve similar performance despite different underlying learned functions, introduces arbitrariness in model selection. While this arbitrariness may seem inconsequential in expectation, its impact on individuals can be severe. This paper explores various individual concerns stemming from multiplicity, including the effects of arbitrariness beyond final predictions, disparate arbitrariness for individuals belonging to protected groups, and the challenges associated with the arbitrariness of a single algorithmic system creating a monopoly across various contexts. It provides both an empirical examination of these concerns and a comprehensive analysis from the legal standpoint, addressing how these issues are perceived in the anti-discrimination law in Canada. We conclude the discussion with technical challenges in the current landscape of model multiplicity to meet legal requirements and the legal gap between current law and the implications of arbitrariness in model selection, highlighting relevant future research directions for both disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan, Samuele Papa, Karl Henrik Johansson, Stefan Bauer, Andrea Dittadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric (OC) representations, which represent the state of a visual scene by modeling it as a composition of objects, have the potential to be used in various downstream tasks to achieve systematic compositional generalization and facilitate reasoning. However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Xue, Yiqi Liu, Lifeng Nai, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud platforms today have been deploying hardware accelerators like neural processing units (NPUs) for powering machine learning (ML) inference services. To maximize the resource utilization while ensuring reasonable quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multi-tenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs for modern cloud platforms is not easy. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and ISA support for enabling fine-grained dynamic operator scheduling for virtualized NPUs.
  We present Neu10, a holistic NPU virtualization framework. We investigate virtualization techniques for NPUs across the entire software and hardware stack. Neu10 consists of (1) a flexible NPU abstraction called vNPU, which enables fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU); (2) a vNPU resource allocator that enables pay-as-you-go computing model and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings for improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness; (3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for facilitating fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We implement Neu10 based on a production-level NPU simulator. Our experiments show that Neu10 improves the throughput of ML inference services by up to 1.4$\times$ and reduces the tail latency by up to 4.6$\times$, while improving the NPU utilization by 1.2$\times$ on average, compared to state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Alexa Chittams, Liseng Fu, Ferhan Ture, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs, but we have been unable to find work that evaluates LLM stability as the main objective. In our study of 6 deterministically configured LLMs across 8 common tasks with 5 identical runs, we see accuracy variations up to 10\%. In addition, no LLM consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks. We also show examples of variation that are not normally distributed and compare configurations with zero-shot/few-shot prompting and fine-tuned examples. To better quantify what is going on, we introduce metrics focused on stability: TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement over parsed-out answers. We suggest that stability metrics be integrated into leader boards and research results going forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kfir Sulimany, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Ryan Hamerly, Prahlad Iyengar, Dirk Englund</p>
<p>Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Sanchez-Stern, Abhishek Varghese, Zhanna Kaufman, Dylan Zhang, Talia Ringer, Yuriy Brun</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification is a promising method for producing reliable software, but the difficulty of manually writing verification proofs severely limits its utility in practice. Recent methods have automated some proof synthesis by guiding a search through the proof space using a theorem prover. Unfortunately, the theorem prover provides only the crudest estimate of progress, resulting in effectively undirected search. To address this problem, we create QEDCartographer, an automated proof-synthesis tool that combines supervised and reinforcement learning to more effectively explore the proof space. QEDCartographer incorporates the proofs' branching structure, enabling reward-free search and overcoming the sparse reward problem inherent to formal verification. We evaluate QEDCartographer using the CoqGym benchmark of 68.5K theorems from 124 open-source Coq projects. QEDCartographer fully automatically proves 21.4% of the test-set theorems. Previous search-based proof-synthesis tools Tok, Tac, ASTactic, Passport, and Proverbot9001, which rely only on supervised learning, prove 9.6%, 9.8%, 10.9%, 12.5%, and 19.8%, respectively. Diva, which combines 62 tools, proves 19.2%. Comparing to the most effective prior tool, Proverbot9001, QEDCartographer produces 34% shorter proofs 29% faster, on average over the theorems both tools prove. Together, QEDCartographer and non-learning-based CoqHammer prove 30.3% of the theorems, while CoqHammer alone proves 26.6%. Our work demonstrates that reinforcement learning is a fruitful research direction for improving proof-synthesis tools' search mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Moon, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology. Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders. To address this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, 'FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. It includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. This dataset could serve as a foundation for the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms. Second, we introduce a simple training strategy utilizing texture maps, applicable to various segmentation models, to detect wrinkles across the face. Our two-stage training strategy first pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k), or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention. We then finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks. The network takes as input a combination of RGB and masked texture map of the image, comprising four channels, in finetuning. We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Programs implemented in various programming languages form the foundation of software applications. To alleviate the burden of program migration and facilitate the development of software systems, automated program translation across languages has garnered significant attention. Previous approaches primarily focus on pairwise translation paradigms, learning translation between pairs of languages using bilingual parallel data. However, parallel data is difficult to collect for some language pairs, and the distribution of program semantics across languages can shift, posing challenges for pairwise program translation. In this paper, we argue that jointly learning a unified model to translate code across multiple programming languages is superior to separately learning from bilingual parallel data. We propose Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation~(VIM-PT), a disentanglement-based generative approach that jointly trains a unified model for multilingual program translation across multiple languages. VIM-PT disentangles code into language-shared and language-specific features, using variational inference and interaction information with a novel lower bound, then achieves program translation through conditional generation. VIM-PT demonstrates four advantages: 1) captures language-shared information more accurately from various implementations and improves the quality of multilingual program translation, 2) mines and leverages the capability of non-parallel data, 3) addresses the distribution shift of program semantics across languages, 4) and serves as a unified model, reducing deployment complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongweiyang Xu, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06613">DemoStart: Demonstration-led auto-curriculum applied to sim-to-real with multi-fingered robots</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Bauza, Jose Enrique Chen, Valentin Dalibard, Nimrod Gileadi, Roland Hafner, Murilo F. Martins, Joss Moore, Rugile Pevceviciute, Antoine Laurens, Dushyant Rao, Martina Zambelli, Martin Riedmiller, Jon Scholz, Konstantinos Bousmalis, Francesco Nori, Nicolas Heess</p>
<p>Abstract: We present DemoStart, a novel auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method capable of learning complex manipulation behaviors on an arm equipped with a three-fingered robotic hand, from only a sparse reward and a handful of demonstrations in simulation. Learning from simulation drastically reduces the development cycle of behavior generation, and domain randomization techniques are leveraged to achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Transferred policies are learned directly from raw pixels from multiple cameras and robot proprioception. Our approach outperforms policies learned from demonstrations on the real robot and requires 100 times fewer demonstrations, collected in simulation.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06724">MLP, XGBoost, KAN, TDNN, and LSTM-GRU Hybrid RNN with Attention for SPX and NDX European Call Option Pricing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Ter-Avanesov, Homayoon Beigi</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the performance of various artificial neural network architectures, including a multilayer perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), LSTM-GRU hybrid recursive neural network (RNN) models, and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) for pricing European call options. In this study, we attempt to leverage the ability of supervised learning methods, such as ANNs, KANs, and gradient-boosted decision trees, to approximate complex multivariate functions in order to calibrate option prices based on past market data. The motivation for using ANNs and KANs is the Universal Approximation Theorem and Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, respectively. Specifically, we use S\&P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index options traded during 2015-2023 with times to maturity ranging from 15 days to over 4 years (OptionMetrics IvyDB US dataset). Black \& Scholes's (BS) PDE \cite{Black1973} model's performance in pricing the same options compared to real data is used as a benchmark. This model relies on strong assumptions, and it has been observed and discussed in the literature that real data does not match its predictions. Supervised learning methods are widely used as an alternative for calibrating option prices due to some of the limitations of this model. In our experiments, the BS model underperforms compared to all of the others. Also, the best TDNN model outperforms the best MLP model on all error metrics. We implement a simple self-attention mechanism to enhance the RNN models, significantly improving their performance. The best-performing model overall is the LSTM-GRU hybrid RNN model with attention. Also, the KAN model outperforms the TDNN and MLP models. We analyze the performance of all models by ticker, moneyness category, and over/under/correctly-priced percentage.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07272">RePlay: a Recommendation Framework for Experimentation and Production Use</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Vasilev, Anna Volodkevich, Denis Kulandin, Tatiana Bysheva, Anton Klenitskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: Using a single tool to build and compare recommender systems significantly reduces the time to market for new models. In addition, the comparison results when using such tools look more consistent. This is why many different tools and libraries for researchers in the field of recommendations have recently appeared. Unfortunately, most of these frameworks are aimed primarily at researchers and require modification for use in production due to the inability to work on large datasets or an inappropriate architecture. In this demo, we present our open-source toolkit RePlay - a framework containing an end-to-end pipeline for building recommender systems, which is ready for production use. RePlay also allows you to use a suitable stack for the pipeline on each stage: Pandas, Polars, or Spark. This allows the library to scale computations and deploy to a cluster. Thus, RePlay allows data scientists to easily move from research mode to production mode using the same interfaces.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07347">The Role of Explainable AI in Revolutionizing Human Health Monitoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Alharthi, Ahmed Alqurashi, Turki Alharbi, Mohammed Alammar, Nasser Aldosari, Houssem Bouchekara, Yusuf Shaaban, Mohammad Shoaib Shahriar, Abdulrahman Al Ayidh</p>
<p>Abstract: The complex nature of disease mechanisms and the variability of patient symptoms present significant obstacles in developing effective diagnostic tools. Although machine learning has made considerable advances in medical diagnosis, its decision-making processes frequently lack transparency, which can jeopardize patient outcomes. This underscores the critical need for Explainable AI (XAI), which not only offers greater clarity but also has the potential to significantly improve patient care. In this literature review, we conduct a detailed analysis of analyzing XAI methods identified through searches across various databases, focusing on chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, stroke, depression, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The literature search revealed the application of 9 trending XAI algorithms in the field of healthcare and highlighted the pros and cons of each of them. Thus, the article is concluded with a critical appraisal of the challenges and future research opportunities for XAI in human health monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjie Wu, Hu Wang, Hsiang-Ting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: During multimodal model training and reasoning, data samples may miss certain modalities and lead to compromised model performance due to sensor limitations, cost constraints, privacy concerns, data loss, and temporal and spatial factors. This survey provides an overview of recent progress in Multimodal Learning with Missing Modality (MLMM), focusing on deep learning techniques. It is the first comprehensive survey that covers the historical background and the distinction between MLMM and standard multimodal learning setups, followed by a detailed analysis of current MLMM methods, applications, and datasets, concluding with a discussion about challenges and potential future directions in the field.</p>
