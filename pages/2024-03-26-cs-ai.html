<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15437">Apriori Knowledge in an Era of Computational Opacity: The Role of AI in Mathematical Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eamon Duede, Kevin Davey</p>
<p>Abstract: Computation is central to contemporary mathematics. Many accept that we can acquire genuine mathematical knowledge of the Four Color Theorem from Appel and Haken's program insofar as it is simply a repetitive application of human forms of mathematical reasoning. Modern LLMs / DNNs are, by contrast, opaque to us in significant ways, and this creates obstacles in obtaining mathematical knowledge from them. We argue, however, that if a proof-checker automating human forms of proof-checking is attached to such machines, then we can obtain apriori mathematical knowledge from them, even though the original machines are entirely opaque to us and the proofs they output are not human-surveyable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seil Kang, Donghyun Kim, Junhyeok Kim, Hyo Kyung Lee, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant methodological strides have been made toward Chest X-ray (CXR) understanding via modern vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating impressive Visual Question Answering (VQA) and CXR report generation abilities. However, existing CXR understanding frameworks still possess several procedural caveats. (1) Previous methods solely use CXR reports, which are insufficient for comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially when additional health-related data like medication history and prior diagnoses are needed. (2) Previous methods use raw CXR reports, which are often arbitrarily structured. While modern language models can understand various text formats, restructuring reports for clearer, organized anatomy-based information could enhance their usefulness. (3) Current evaluation methods for CXR-VQA primarily emphasize linguistic correctness, lacking the capability to offer nuanced assessments of the generated answers. In this work, to address the aforementioned caveats, we introduce WoLF, a Wide-scope Large Language Model Framework for CXR understanding. To resolve (1), we capture multi-faceted records of patients, which are utilized for accurate diagnoses in real-world clinical scenarios. Specifically, we adopt the Electronic Health Records (EHR) to generate instruction-following data suited for CXR understanding. Regarding (2), we enhance report generation performance by decoupling knowledge in CXR reports based on anatomical structure even within the attention step via masked attention. To address (3), we introduce an AI-evaluation protocol optimized for assessing the capabilities of LLM. Through extensive experimental validations, WoLF demonstrates superior performance over other models on MIMIC-CXR in the AI-evaluation arena about VQA (up to +9.47%p mean score) and by metrics about report generation (+7.3%p BLEU-1).</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15504">SymboSLAM: Semantic Map Generation in a Multi-Agent System</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Curtis Colelough</p>
<p>Abstract: Sub-symbolic artificial intelligence methods dominate the fields of environment-type classification and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping. However, a significant area overlooked within these fields is solution transparency for the human-machine interaction space, as the sub-symbolic methods employed for map generation do not account for the explainability of the solutions generated. This paper proposes a novel approach to environment-type classification through Symbolic Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping, SymboSLAM, to bridge the explainability gap. Our method for environment-type classification observes ontological reasoning used to synthesise the context of an environment through the features found within. We achieve explainability within the model by presenting operators with environment-type classifications overlayed by a semantically labelled occupancy map of landmarks and features. We evaluate SymboSLAM with ground-truth maps of the Canberra region, demonstrating method effectiveness. We assessed the system through both simulations and real-world trials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Xia, Qingqing Zhao, Yunfei Long, Ge Xu, Jia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional research approaches, sensory perception and emotion classification have traditionally been considered separate domains. Yet, the significant influence of sensory experiences on emotional responses is undeniable. The natural language processing (NLP) community has often missed the opportunity to merge sensory knowledge with emotion classification. To address this gap, we propose SensoryT5, a neuro-cognitive approach that integrates sensory information into the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, designed specifically for fine-grained emotion classification. This methodology incorporates sensory cues into the T5's attention mechanism, enabling a harmonious balance between contextual understanding and sensory awareness. The resulting model amplifies the richness of emotional representations. In rigorous tests across various detailed emotion classification datasets, SensoryT5 showcases improved performance, surpassing both the foundational T5 model and current state-of-the-art works. Notably, SensoryT5's success signifies a pivotal change in the NLP domain, highlighting the potential influence of neuro-cognitive data in refining machine learning models' emotional sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Li, H. Eric Tseng, Anouck Girard, Ilya Kolmanovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving depends on perception systems to understand the environment and to inform downstream decision-making. While advanced perception systems utilizing black-box Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) demonstrate human-like comprehension, their unpredictable behavior and lack of interpretability may hinder their deployment in safety critical scenarios. In this paper, we develop an Ensemble of DNN regressors (Deep Ensemble) that generates predictions with quantification of prediction uncertainties. In the scenario of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), we employ the Deep Ensemble to estimate distance headway to the lead vehicle from RGB images and enable the downstream controller to account for the estimation uncertainty. We develop an adaptive cruise controller that utilizes Stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) with chance constraints to provide a probabilistic safety guarantee. We evaluate our ACC algorithm using a high-fidelity traffic simulator and a real-world traffic dataset and demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to effect speed tracking and car following while maintaining a safe distance headway. The out-of-distribution scenarios are also examined.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15586">Generative AI in Education: A Study of Educators&#x27; Awareness, Sentiments, and Influencing Factors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashish Ghimire, James Prather, John Edwards</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. This study delves into university instructors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towardsadoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Zuheros, David Herrera-Poyatos, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: Social Media and Internet have the potential to be exploited as a source of opinion to enrich Decision Making solutions. Crowd Decision Making (CDM) is a methodology able to infer opinions and decisions from plain texts, such as reviews published in social media platforms, by means of Sentiment Analysis. Currently, the emergence and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) lead us to explore new scenarios of automatically understand written texts, also known as natural language processing. This paper analyzes the use of ChatGPT based on prompt design strategies to assist in CDM processes to extract opinions and make decisions. We integrate ChatGPT in CDM processes as a flexible tool that infer the opinions expressed in texts, providing numerical or linguistic evaluations where the decision making models are based on the prompt design strategies. We include a multi-criteria decision making scenario with a category ontology for criteria. We also consider ChatGPT as an end-to-end CDM model able to provide a general opinion and score on the alternatives. We conduct empirical experiments on real data extracted from TripAdvisor, the TripR-2020Large dataset. The analysis of results show a promising branch for developing quality decision making models using ChatGPT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of consistency, sensitivity and explainability associated to the use of LLMs in CDM processes, raising open questions for future studies.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15640">Contextual Restless Multi-Armed Bandits with Application to Demand Response Decision-Making</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Chen, I-Hong Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-armed bandits framework, termed Contextual Restless Bandits (CRB), for complex online decision-making. This CRB framework incorporates the core features of contextual bandits and restless bandits, so that it can model both the internal state transitions of each arm and the influence of external global environmental contexts. Using the dual decomposition method, we develop a scalable index policy algorithm for solving the CRB problem, and theoretically analyze the asymptotical optimality of this algorithm. In the case when the arm models are unknown, we further propose a model-based online learning algorithm based on the index policy to learn the arm models and make decisions simultaneously. Furthermore, we apply the proposed CRB framework and the index policy algorithm specifically to the demand response decision-making problem in smart grids. The numerical simulations demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our proposed CRB approaches.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15696">MixRED: A Mix-lingual Relation Extraction Dataset</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxing Kong, Yougang Chu, Zheng Ma, Jianbing Zhang, Liang He, Jiajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Relation extraction is a critical task in the field of natural language processing with numerous real-world applications. Existing research primarily focuses on monolingual relation extraction or cross-lingual enhancement for relation extraction. Yet, there remains a significant gap in understanding relation extraction in the mix-lingual (or code-switching) scenario, where individuals intermix contents from different languages within sentences, generating mix-lingual content. Due to the lack of a dedicated dataset, the effectiveness of existing relation extraction models in such a scenario is largely unexplored. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task of considering relation extraction in the mix-lingual scenario called MixRE and constructing the human-annotated dataset MixRED to support this task. In addition to constructing the MixRED dataset, we evaluate both state-of-the-art supervised models and large language models (LLMs) on MixRED, revealing their respective advantages and limitations in the mix-lingual scenario. Furthermore, we delve into factors influencing model performance within the MixRE task and uncover promising directions for enhancing the performance of both supervised models and LLMs in this novel task.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15728">Learnable WSN Deployment of Evidential Collaborative Sensing Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Liu, Tianxiang Zhan, Zhen Li, Yong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), coverage and deployment are two most crucial issues when conducting detection tasks. However, the detection information collected from sensors is oftentimes not fully utilized and efficiently integrated. Such sensing model and deployment strategy, thereby, cannot reach the maximum quality of coverage, particularly when the amount of sensors within WSNs expands significantly. In this article, we aim at achieving the optimal coverage quality of WSN deployment. We develop a collaborative sensing model of sensors to enhance detection capabilities of WSNs, by leveraging the collaborative information derived from the combination rule under the framework of evidence theory. In this model, the performance evaluation of evidential fusion systems is adopted as the criterion of the sensor selection. A learnable sensor deployment network (LSDNet) considering both sensor contribution and detection capability, is proposed for achieving the optimal deployment of WSNs. Moreover, we deeply investigate the algorithm for finding the requisite minimum number of sensors that realizes the full coverage of WSNs. A series of numerical examples, along with an application of forest area monitoring, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqing Zhang, Yang Liu, Yang Hua, Jian Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) enables collaborative learning on multiple clients with different model architectures while preserving privacy. Despite recent research progress, knowledge sharing in HtFL is still difficult due to data and model heterogeneity. To tackle this issue, we leverage the knowledge stored in pre-trained generators and propose a new upload-efficient knowledge transfer scheme called Federated Knowledge-Transfer Loop (FedKTL). Our FedKTL can produce client-task-related prototypical image-vector pairs via the generator's inference on the server. With these pairs, each client can transfer pre-existing knowledge from the generator to its local model through an additional supervised local task. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets under two types of data heterogeneity with 14 kinds of models including CNNs and ViTs. Results show that our upload-efficient FedKTL surpasses seven state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.31% in accuracy. Moreover, our knowledge transfer scheme is applicable in scenarios with only one edge client. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/FedKTL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youyang Qu, Ming Ding, Nan Sun, Kanchana Thilakarathna, Tianqing Zhu, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to AI advancements, facilitating applications like predictive text generation. Nonetheless, they pose risks by potentially memorizing and disseminating sensitive, biased, or copyrighted information from their vast datasets. Machine unlearning emerges as a cutting-edge solution to mitigate these concerns, offering techniques for LLMs to selectively discard certain data. This paper reviews the latest in machine unlearning for LLMs, introducing methods for the targeted forgetting of information to address privacy, ethical, and legal challenges without necessitating full model retraining. It divides existing research into unlearning from unstructured/textual data and structured/classification data, showcasing the effectiveness of these approaches in removing specific data while maintaining model efficacy. Highlighting the practicality of machine unlearning, this analysis also points out the hurdles in preserving model integrity, avoiding excessive or insufficient data removal, and ensuring consistent outputs, underlining the role of machine unlearning in advancing responsible, ethical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Zhao, Neil Vetter, Kaveh Aryan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 into the ontology refinement process, specifically focusing on the OntoClean methodology. OntoClean, critical for assessing the metaphysical quality of ontologies, involves a two-step process of assigning meta-properties to classes and verifying a set of constraints. Manually conducting the first step proves difficult in practice, due to the need for philosophical expertise and lack of consensus among ontologists. By employing LLMs with two prompting strategies, the study demonstrates that high accuracy in the labelling process can be achieved. The findings suggest the potential for LLMs to enhance ontology refinement, proposing the development of plugin software for ontology tools to facilitate this integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyubok Lee, Woosog Chay, Seonhee Cho, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While achieving high accuracy in SQL generation is crucial, little is known about the extent to which these text-to-SQL models can reliably handle diverse types of questions encountered during real-world deployment, including unanswerable ones. To explore this aspect, we present TrustSQL, a new benchmark designed to assess the reliability of text-to-SQL models in both single-database and cross-database settings. The benchmark tasks models with providing one of two outcomes: 1) SQL prediction; or 2) abstention from making a prediction, either when there is a potential error in the generated SQL or when faced with unanswerable questions. For model evaluation, we explore various modeling approaches specifically designed for this task. These include: 1) optimizing separate models for answerability detection, SQL generation, and error detection, which are then integrated into a single pipeline; and 2) developing a unified approach that optimizes a single model to address the proposed task. Experimental results using our new reliability score show that addressing this challenge involves many different areas of research and opens new avenues for model development. Nonetheless, none of the methods surpass the reliability performance of the naive baseline, which abstains from answering all questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqiang Xiao, Jiayu Huo, Haotian Zheng, Yang Liu, Sebastien Ourselin, Rachel Sparks</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, automated medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning have achieved great success. However, they heavily rely on large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Few-shot learning aims to overcome the need for annotated data by using a small labeled dataset, known as a support set, to guide predicting labels for new, unlabeled images, known as the query set. Inspired by this paradigm, we introduce MatchSeg, a novel framework that enhances medical image segmentation through strategic reference image matching. We leverage contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to select highly relevant samples when defining the support set. Additionally, we design a joint attention module to strengthen the interaction between support and query features, facilitating a more effective knowledge transfer between support and query sets. We validated our method across four public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior segmentation performance and powerful domain generalization ability of MatchSeg against existing methods for domain-specific and cross-domain segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albin Larsson Forsberg, Alexandros Nikou, Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan, Jana Tumova</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning is scalability as the number of agents increases. This issue is further exacerbated if the problem considered is temporally dependent. State-of-the-art solutions today mainly follow centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm in order to handle the scalability concerns. In this paper, we propose time-dependent multi-agent transformers which can solve the temporally dependent multi-agent problem efficiently with a centralized approach via the use of transformers that proficiently handle the large input. We highlight the efficacy of this method on two problems and use tools from statistics to verify the probability that the trajectories generated under the policy satisfy the task. The experiments show that our approach has superior performance against the literature baseline algorithms in both cases.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15933">Understanding Domain-Size Generalization in Markov Logic Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Chen, Felix Weitk\"amper, Sagar Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the generalization behavior of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) across relational structures of different sizes. Multiple works have noticed that MLNs learned on a given domain generalize poorly across domains of different sizes. This behavior emerges from a lack of internal consistency within an MLN when used across different domain sizes. In this paper, we quantify this inconsistency and bound it in terms of the variance of the MLN parameters. The parameter variance also bounds the KL divergence between an MLN's marginal distributions taken from different domain sizes. We use these bounds to show that maximizing the data log-likelihood while simultaneously minimizing the parameter variance corresponds to two natural notions of generalization across domain sizes. Our theoretical results apply to Exponential Random Graphs and other Markov network based relational models. Finally, we observe that solutions known to decrease the variance of the MLN parameters, like regularization and Domain-Size Aware MLNs, increase the internal consistency of the MLNs. We empirically verify our results on four different datasets, with different methods to control parameter variance, showing that controlling parameter variance leads to better generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we suggest new SAT encodings of the partial-ordering based ILP model for the graph coloring problem (GCP) and the bandwidth coloring problem (BCP). The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices get different colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weight that enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal is to minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, we experimentally compare our new SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approaches on the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding is effective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on some DIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that the partial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smaller size than that of the classical assignment-based model. Our practical evaluation confirms not only a dominance compared to the assignment-based encodings but also to the state-of-the-art approaches on a set of benchmark instances. Up to our knowledge, we have solved several open instances of the BCP from the literature for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejin Kim, Youngbin Lee, Vincent Yuan, Annika Lee, Yongjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems, crucial for user engagement on platforms like e-commerce and streaming services, often lag behind users' evolving preferences due to static data reliance. After Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) were proposed, various studies have shown that TGN can significantly improve situations where the features of nodes and edges dynamically change over time. However, despite its promising capabilities, it has not been directly applied in recommender systems to date. Our study bridges this gap by directly implementing Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) in recommender systems, a first in this field. Using real-world datasets and a range of graph and history embedding methods, we show TGN's adaptability, confirming its effectiveness in dynamic recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linzhi Wu, Xingyu Zhang, Yakun Zhang, Changyan Zheng, Tiejun Liu, Liang Xie, Ye Yan, Erwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip reading, the process of interpreting silent speech from visual lip movements, has gained rising attention for its wide range of realistic applications. Deep learning approaches greatly improve current lip reading systems. However, lip reading in cross-speaker scenarios where the speaker identity changes, poses a challenging problem due to inter-speaker variability. A well-trained lip reading system may perform poorly when handling a brand new speaker. To learn a speaker-robust lip reading model, a key insight is to reduce visual variations across speakers, avoiding the model overfitting to specific speakers. In this work, in view of both input visual clues and latent representations based on a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, we propose to exploit the lip landmark-guided fine-grained visual clues instead of frequently-used mouth-cropped images as input features, diminishing speaker-specific appearance characteristics. Furthermore, a max-min mutual information regularization approach is proposed to capture speaker-insensitive latent representations. Experimental evaluations on public lip reading datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the intra-speaker and inter-speaker conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyu Chen, Guoqiang Li, Ling-I Wu, Ruibang Liu, Yuxin Su, Xi Chang, Jianxin Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing logic problems. capitalizing on the great capabilities of LLMs for code-related activities, several frameworks leveraging logical solvers for logic reasoning have been proposed recently. While existing research predominantly focuses on viewing LLMs as natural language logic solvers or translators, their roles as logic code interpreters and executors have received limited attention. This study delves into a novel aspect, namely logic code simulation, which forces LLMs to emulate logical solvers in predicting the results of logical programs. To further investigate this novel task, we formulate our three research questions: Can LLMs efficiently simulate the outputs of logic codes? What strength arises along with logic code simulation? And what pitfalls? To address these inquiries, we curate three novel datasets tailored for the logic code simulation task and undertake thorough experiments to establish the baseline performance of LLMs in code simulation. Subsequently, we introduce a pioneering LLM-based code simulation technique, Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL). This technique advocates a dual-path thinking approach for LLMs, which has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to other LLM prompt strategies, achieving a notable improvement in accuracy by 7.06% with GPT-4-Turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Sasaki, Sohei Tokuno, Haruka Maeda, Osamu Sakura</p>
<p>Abstract: Which fairness metrics are appropriately applicable in your contexts? There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate the appropriateness of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 responses, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics, and each participant answers their preference for the fairness metric in each case. This investigation explores the relationship between personal attributes and the choice of fairness metrics, uncovering a significant influence of national context on these preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Xu, Lixin Cui, Yue Wang, Hangyuan Du, Lu Bai, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel local graph pooling method, namely the Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling (SSHPool), for graph classification. To this end, we commence by assigning the nodes of a sample graph into different clusters, resulting in a family of separated subgraphs. We individually employ a local graph convolution units as the local structure to further compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. Since these subgraphs are separated by different clusters and the structural information cannot be propagated between them, the local convolution operation can significantly avoid the over-smoothing problem arising in most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By hierarchically performing the proposed procedures on the resulting coarsened graph, the proposed SSHPool can effectively extract the hierarchical global feature of the original graph structure, encapsulating rich intrinsic structural characteristics. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end GNN framework associated with the proposed SSHPool module for graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model on real-world datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art GNN methods in terms of the classification accuracies.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16162">Multi-Task Learning with Multi-Task Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Bai, Abhishek Gupta, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning solves multiple correlated tasks. However, conflicts may exist between them. In such circumstances, a single solution can rarely optimize all the tasks, leading to performance trade-offs. To arrive at a set of optimized yet well-distributed models that collectively embody different trade-offs in one algorithmic pass, this paper proposes to view Pareto multi-task learning through the lens of multi-task optimization. Multi-task learning is first cast as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is then decomposed into a diverse set of unconstrained scalar-valued subproblems. These subproblems are solved jointly using a novel multi-task gradient descent method, whose uniqueness lies in the iterative transfer of model parameters among the subproblems during the course of optimization. A theorem proving faster convergence through the inclusion of such transfers is presented. We investigate the proposed multi-task learning with multi-task optimization for solving various problem settings including image classification, scene understanding, and multi-target regression. Comprehensive experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in discovering sets of Pareto-optimized models. Notably, on the large image dataset we tested on, namely NYUv2, the hypervolume convergence achieved by our method was found to be nearly two times faster than the next-best among the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mateus Rocha Filho, Thiago Alves Rocha, Reginaldo Pereira Fernandes Ribeiro, Ajalmar R\^ego da Rocha Neto</p>
<p>Abstract: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a well-known Machine Learning (ML) model for linear classification problems. It can be used in conjunction with a reject option strategy to reject instances that are hard to correctly classify and delegate them to a specialist. This further increases the confidence of the model. Given this, obtaining an explanation of the cause of rejection is important to not blindly trust the obtained results. While most of the related work has developed means to give such explanations for machine learning models, to the best of our knowledge none have done so for when reject option is present. We propose a logic-based approach with formal guarantees on the correctness and minimality of explanations for linear SVCs with reject option. We evaluate our approach by comparing it to Anchors, which is a heuristic algorithm for generating explanations. Obtained results show that our proposed method gives shorter explanations with reduced time cost.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16206">Rumor Detection with a novel graph neural network approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianrui Liu, Qi Cai, Changxin Xu, Zhanxin Zhou, Fanghao Ni, Yuxin Qiao, Tsungwei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide spread of rumors on social media has caused a negative impact on people's daily life, leading to potential panic, fear, and mental health problems for the public. How to debunk rumors as early as possible remains a challenging problem. Existing studies mainly leverage information propagation structure to detect rumors, while very few works focus on correlation among users that they may coordinate to spread rumors in order to gain large popularity. In this paper, we propose a new detection model, that jointly learns both the representations of user correlation and information propagation to detect rumors on social media. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks to learn the representations of user correlation from a bipartite graph that describes the correlations between users and source tweets, and the representations of information propagation with a tree structure. Then we combine the learned representations from these two modules to classify the rumors. Since malicious users intend to subvert our model after deployment, we further develop a greedy attack scheme to analyze the cost of three adversarial attacks: graph attack, comment attack, and joint attack. Evaluation results on two public datasets illustrate that the proposed MODEL outperforms the state-of-the-art rumor detection models. We also demonstrate our method performs well for early rumor detection. Moreover, the proposed detection method is more robust to adversarial attacks compared to the best existing method. Importantly, we show that it requires a high cost for attackers to subvert user correlation pattern, demonstrating the importance of considering user correlation for rumor detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Barron, Maksim E. Eren, Manish Bhattarai, Nicholas Solovyev, Kim Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov, Charles Nicholas, Cynthia Matuszek</p>
<p>Abstract: Much of human knowledge in cybersecurity is encapsulated within the ever-growing volume of scientific papers. As this textual data continues to expand, the importance of document organization methods becomes increasingly crucial for extracting actionable insights hidden within large text datasets. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serve as a means to store factual information in a structured manner, providing explicit, interpretable knowledge that includes domain-specific information from the cybersecurity scientific literature. One of the challenges in constructing a KG from scientific literature is the extraction of ontology from unstructured text. In this paper, we address this topic and introduce a method for building a multi-modal KG by extracting structured ontology from scientific papers. We demonstrate this concept in the cybersecurity domain. One modality of the KG represents observable information from the papers, such as the categories in which they were published or the authors. The second modality uncovers latent (hidden) patterns of text extracted through hierarchical and semantic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), such as named entities, topics or clusters, and keywords. We illustrate this concept by consolidating more than two million scientific papers uploaded to arXiv into the cyber-domain, using hierarchical and semantic NMF, and by building a cyber-domain-specific KG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Changes and updates in the requirement artifacts, which can be frequent in the automotive domain, are a challenge for SafetyOps. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their impressive natural language understanding and generating capabilities, can play a key role in automatically refining and decomposing requirements after each update. In this study, we propose a prototype of a pipeline of prompts and LLMs that receives an item definition and outputs solutions in the form of safety requirements. This pipeline also performs a review of the requirement dataset and identifies redundant or contradictory requirements. We first identified the necessary characteristics for performing HARA and then defined tests to assess an LLM's capability in meeting these criteria. We used design science with multiple iterations and let experts from different companies evaluate each cycle quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, the prototype was implemented at a case company and the responsible team evaluated its efficiency.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16393">Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED) for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhua Zhu, Javier Conde, Zhen Gao, Pedro Reviriego, Shanshan Liu, Fabrizio Lombardi</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide adoption of Large language models (LLMs) makes their dependability a pressing concern. Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their impact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important issue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to the internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that need access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that the output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text. Therefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal text, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose to perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts some linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a concurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection mechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs in which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has been evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the OPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of linguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show that CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of the concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection effectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a designer.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16416">How Reliable is Your Simulator? Analysis on the Limitations of Current LLM-based User Simulators for Conversational Recommendation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixi Zhu, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational Recommender System (CRS) interacts with users through natural language to understand their preferences and provide personalized recommendations in real-time. CRS has demonstrated significant potential, prompting researchers to address the development of more realistic and reliable user simulators as a key focus. Recently, the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted a lot of attention in various fields. Simultaneously, efforts are underway to construct user simulators based on LLMs. While these works showcase innovation, they also come with certain limitations that require attention. In this work, we aim to analyze the limitations of using LLMs in constructing user simulators for CRS, to guide future research. To achieve this goal, we conduct analytical validation on the notable work, iEvaLM. Through multiple experiments on two widely-used datasets in the field of conversational recommendation, we highlight several issues with the current evaluation methods for user simulators based on LLMs: (1) Data leakage, which occurs in conversational history and the user simulator's replies, results in inflated evaluation results. (2) The success of CRS recommendations depends more on the availability and quality of conversational history than on the responses from user simulators. (3) Controlling the output of the user simulator through a single prompt template proves challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimpleUserSim, employing a straightforward strategy to guide the topic toward the target items. Our study validates the ability of CRS models to utilize the interaction information, significantly improving the recommendation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Wang, Yingpeng Du, Zhu Sun, Haoyan Chua, Kaidong Feng, Wenya Wang, Jie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.
  However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.
  Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.
  To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.
  In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.
  To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.
  To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.
  It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debodeep Banerjee, Stefano Teso, Burcu Sayin Grunel, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: There is increasing interest in developing AIs for assisting human decision making in \textit{high-stakes} tasks, such as medical diagnosis, for the purpose of improving decision quality and reducing cognitive strain.
  %
  Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention.
  %
  This \textit{separation of responsibilities} setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions due to \textit{anchoring bias}, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained.
  %
  As a remedy, we introduce \textit{learning to guide} (LTG), an alternative framework in which -- rather than taking control from the human expert -- the machine provides \textit{guidance} useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision.
  %
  In order to ensure guidance is \textit{interpretable} and \textit{task-specific}, we develop \method, an approach for turning \textit{any} vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback.
  %
  Our empirical evaluation highlights the promise of \method on a challenging, real-world medical diagnosis task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current approaches for learning for planning have yet to achieve competitive performance against classical planners in several domains, and have poor overall performance. In this work, we construct novel graph representations of lifted planning tasks and use the WL algorithm to generate features from them. These features are used with classical machine learning methods which have up to 2 orders of magnitude fewer parameters and train up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning for planning models. Our novel approach, WL-GOOSE, reliably learns heuristics from scratch and outperforms the $h^{\text{FF}}$ heuristic in a fair competition setting. It also outperforms or ties with LAMA on 4 out of 10 domains on coverage and 7 out of 10 domains on plan quality. WL-GOOSE is the first learning for planning model which achieves these feats. Furthermore, we study the connections between our novel WL feature generation method, previous theoretically flavoured learning architectures, and Description Logic Features for planning.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16524">Harnessing the power of LLMs for normative reasoning in MASs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bastin Tony Roy Savarimuthu, Surangika Ranathunga, Stephen Cranefield</p>
<p>Abstract: Software agents, both human and computational, do not exist in isolation and often need to collaborate or coordinate with others to achieve their goals. In human society, social mechanisms such as norms ensure efficient functioning, and these techniques have been adopted by researchers in multi-agent systems (MAS) to create socially aware agents. However, traditional techniques have limitations, such as operating in limited environments often using brittle symbolic reasoning. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising solution, providing a rich and expressive vocabulary for norms and enabling norm-capable agents that can perform a range of tasks such as norm discovery, normative reasoning and decision-making. This paper examines the potential of LLM-based agents to acquire normative capabilities, drawing on recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLM research. We present our vision for creating normative LLM agents. In particular, we discuss how the recently proposed "LLM agent" approaches can be extended to implement such normative LLM agents. We also highlight challenges in this emerging field. This paper thus aims to foster collaboration between MAS, NLP and LLM researchers in order to advance the field of normative agents.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16527">Hallucination Detection in Foundation Models for Decision-Making: A Flexible Definition and Review of the State of the Art</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Neeloy Chakraborty, Melkior Ornik, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous systems are soon to be ubiquitous, from manufacturing autonomy to agricultural field robots, and from health care assistants to the entertainment industry. The majority of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these existing approaches have been shown to perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in rare, out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has led researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning that existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense reasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to out-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large language models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems domains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in deployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically, foundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiteng Fang, Liang Zhu, Min Yang, Xi Feng, Jinchang Hou, Qixuan Zhao, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a crucial technique in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, ensuring these LLMs behave in beneficial and comprehensible ways to users. However, a longstanding challenge in human alignment techniques based on reinforcement learning lies in their inherent complexity and difficulty in training. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective Contrastive Learning Framework for Human Alignment (CLHA) to align LLMs with human preferences directly. CLHA employs a novel rescoring strategy to evaluate the noise within the data by considering its inherent quality and dynamically adjusting the training process. Simultaneously, CLHA utilizes pairwise contrastive loss and adaptive supervised fine-tuning loss to adaptively modify the likelihood of generating responses, ensuring enhanced alignment with human preferences. Using advanced methods, CLHA surpasses other algorithms, showcasing superior performance in terms of reward model scores, automatic evaluations, and human assessments on the widely used ``\textit{Helpful and Harmless}'' dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Acero, Parisa Zehtabi, Nicolas Marchesotti, Michael Cashmore, Daniele Magazzeni, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Portfolio optimization involves determining the optimal allocation of portfolio assets in order to maximize a given investment objective. Traditionally, some form of mean-variance optimization is used with the aim of maximizing returns while minimizing risk, however, more recently, deep reinforcement learning formulations have been explored. Increasingly, investors have demonstrated an interest in incorporating ESG objectives when making investment decisions, and modifications to the classical mean-variance optimization framework have been developed. In this work, we study the use of deep reinforcement learning for responsible portfolio optimization, by incorporating ESG states and objectives, and provide comparisons against modified mean-variance approaches. Our results show that deep reinforcement learning policies can provide competitive performance against mean-variance approaches for responsible portfolio allocation across additive and multiplicative utility functions of financial and ESG responsibility objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Khrapov, Vadim Popov, Tasnima Sadekova, Assel Yermekova, Mikhail Kudinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are known to be vulnerable to outliers in training data. In this paper we study an alternative diffusion loss function, which can preserve the high quality of generated data like the original squared $L_{2}$ loss while at the same time being robust to outliers. We propose to use pseudo-Huber loss function with a time-dependent parameter to allow for the trade-off between robustness on the most vulnerable early reverse-diffusion steps and fine details restoration on the final steps. We show that pseudo-Huber loss with the time-dependent parameter exhibits better performance on corrupted datasets in both image and audio domains. In addition, the loss function we propose can potentially help diffusion models to resist dataset corruption while not requiring data filtering or purification compared to conventional training algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Durasov, Doruk Oner, Jonathan Donier, Hieu Le, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Turning pass-through network architectures into iterative ones, which use their own output as input, is a well-known approach for boosting performance. In this paper, we argue that such architectures offer an additional benefit: The convergence rate of their successive outputs is highly correlated with the accuracy of the value to which they converge. Thus, we can use the convergence rate as a useful proxy for uncertainty. This results in an approach to uncertainty estimation that provides state-of-the-art estimates at a much lower computational cost than techniques like Ensembles, and without requiring any modifications to the original iterative model. We demonstrate its practical value by embedding it in two application domains: road detection in aerial images and the estimation of aerodynamic properties of 2D and 3D shapes.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16750">All Artificial, Less Intelligence: GenAI through the Lens of Formal Verification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Narayan Gadde, Aman Kumar, Thomas Nalapat, Evgenii Rezunov, Fabio Cappellini</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern hardware designs have grown increasingly efficient and complex. However, they are often susceptible to Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). This paper is focused on the formal verification of CWEs in a dataset of hardware designs written in SystemVerilog from Regenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We applied formal verification to categorize each hardware design as vulnerable or CWE-free. This dataset was generated by 4 different LLMs and features a unique set of designs for each of the 10 CWEs we target in our paper. We have associated the identified vulnerabilities with CWE numbers for a dataset of 60,000 generated SystemVerilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) code. It was also found that most LLMs are not aware of any hardware CWEs; hence they are usually not considered when generating the hardware code. Our study reveals that approximately 60% of the hardware designs generated by LLMs are prone to CWEs, posing potential safety and security risks. The dataset could be ideal for training LLMs and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to abstain from generating CWE-prone hardware designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Kelly, S. Ali Zafar, L. Heidemann, J. Zacchi, D. Espinoza, N. Mata</p>
<p>Abstract: In December 2023, the European Parliament provisionally agreed on the EU AI Act. This unprecedented regulatory framework for AI systems lays out guidelines to ensure the safety, legality, and trustworthiness of AI products. This paper presents a methodology for interpreting the EU AI Act requirements for high-risk AI systems by leveraging product quality models. We first propose an extended product quality model for AI systems, incorporating attributes relevant to the Act not covered by current quality models. We map the Act requirements to relevant quality attributes with the goal of refining them into measurable characteristics. We then propose a contract-based approach to derive technical requirements at the stakeholder level. This facilitates the development and assessment of AI systems that not only adhere to established quality standards, but also comply with the regulatory requirements outlined in the Act for high-risk (including safety-critical) AI systems. We demonstrate the applicability of this methodology on an exemplary automotive supply chain use case, where several stakeholders interact to achieve EU AI Act compliance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blai Bonet, Dominik Drexler, Hector Geffner</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a simple but powerful language for expressing and learning general policies and problem decompositions (sketches) has been introduced in terms of rules defined over a set of Boolean and numerical features. In this work, we consider three extensions of this language aimed at making policies and sketches more flexible and reusable: internal memory states, as in finite state controllers; indexical features, whose values are a function of the state and a number of internal registers that can be loaded with objects; and modules that wrap up policies and sketches and allow them to call each other by passing parameters. In addition, unlike general policies that select state transitions rather than ground actions, the new language allows for the selection of such actions. The expressive power of the resulting language for policies and sketches is illustrated through a number of examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zerui Wang, Yan Liu, Abishek Arumugam Thiruselvi, Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we propose the early adoption of Explainable AI (XAI) with a focus on three properties: Quality of explanation, the explanation summaries should be consistent across multiple XAI methods; Architectural Compatibility, for effective integration in XAI, the architecture styles of both the XAI methods and the models to be explained must be compatible with the framework; Configurable operations, XAI explanations are operable, akin to machine learning operations. Thus, an explanation for AI models should be reproducible and tractable to be trustworthy. We present XAIport, a framework of XAI microservices encapsulated into Open APIs to deliver early explanations as observation for learning model quality assurance. XAIport enables configurable XAI operations along with machine learning development. We quantify the operational costs of incorporating XAI with three cloud computer vision services on Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Amazon Rekognition. Our findings show comparable operational costs between XAI and traditional machine learning, with XAIport significantly improving both cloud AI model performance and explanation stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \"Onder G\"urcan, Nataliya Yakymets, Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni, Ansgar Radermacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is one of the safety analysis methods recommended by most of the international standards. The classical FMECA is made in a form of a table filled in either manually or by using safety analysis tools. In both cases, the design engineers have to choose the trade-offs between safety and other development constraints. In the case of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) with thousands of specified constraints, this may lead to severe problems and significantly impact the overall criticality of CPS. In this paper, we propose to adopt optimization techniques to automate the decision making process conducted after FMECA of CPS. We describe a multi-agent based optimization method which extends classical FMECA for offering optimal solutions in terms of criticality and development constraints of CPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nassim Belmecheri, Arnaud Gotlieb, Nadjib Lazaar, Helge Spieker</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding driving scenes and communicating automated vehicle decisions are key requirements for trustworthy automated driving. In this article, we introduce the Qualitative Explainable Graph (QXG), which is a unified symbolic and qualitative representation for scene understanding in urban mobility. The QXG enables interpreting an automated vehicle's environment using sensor data and machine learning models. It utilizes spatio-temporal graphs and qualitative constraints to extract scene semantics from raw sensor inputs, such as LiDAR and camera data, offering an interpretable scene model. A QXG can be incrementally constructed in real-time, making it a versatile tool for in-vehicle explanations across various sensor types. Our research showcases the potential of QXG, particularly in the context of automated driving, where it can rationalize decisions by linking the graph with observed actions. These explanations can serve diverse purposes, from informing passengers and alerting vulnerable road users to enabling post-hoc analysis of prior behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinka Mori, Oana Ignat, Andrew Lee, Rada Mihalcea</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation has the potential to impact applications and domains with scarce data. However, before such data is used for sensitive tasks such as mental health, we need an understanding of how different demographics are represented in it. In our paper, we analyze the potential of producing synthetic data using GPT-3 by exploring the various stressors it attributes to different race and gender combinations, to provide insight for future researchers looking into using LLMs for data generation. Using GPT-3, we develop HEADROOM, a synthetic dataset of 3,120 posts about depression-triggering stressors, by controlling for race, gender, and time frame (before and after COVID-19). Using this dataset, we conduct semantic and lexical analyses to (1) identify the predominant stressors for each demographic group; and (2) compare our synthetic data to a human-generated dataset. We present the procedures to generate queries to develop depression data using GPT-3, and conduct analyzes to uncover the types of stressors it assigns to demographic groups, which could be used to test the limitations of LLMs for synthetic data generation for depression data. Our findings show that synthetic data mimics some of the human-generated data distribution for the predominant depression stressors across diverse demographics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanane Kteich, Na Li, Usashi Chatterjee, Zied Bouraoui, Steven Schockaert</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept embeddings offer a practical and efficient mechanism for injecting commonsense knowledge into downstream tasks. Their core purpose is often not to predict the commonsense properties of concepts themselves, but rather to identify commonalities, i.e.\ sets of concepts which share some property of interest. Such commonalities are the basis for inductive generalisation, hence high-quality concept embeddings can make learning easier and more robust. Unfortunately, standard embeddings primarily reflect basic taxonomic categories, making them unsuitable for finding commonalities that refer to more specific aspects (e.g.\ the colour of objects or the materials they are made of). In this paper, we address this limitation by explicitly modelling the different facets of interest when learning concept embeddings. We show that this leads to embeddings which capture a more diverse range of commonsense properties, and consistently improves results in downstream tasks such as ultra-fine entity typing and ontology completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yago Bea, Raul Jimenez, David Mateos, Shuheng Liu, Pavlos Protopapas, Pedro Taranc\'on-\'Alvarez, Pablo Tejerina-P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and second-order phase transitions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bart Rienties, John Domingue, Subby Duttaroy, Christothea Herodotou, Felipe Tessarolo, Denise Whitelock</p>
<p>Abstract: With the release of Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, an increasing interest in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been observed across domains, including higher education. While emerging statistics show the popularity of using AI amongst undergraduate students, little is yet known about students' perceptions regarding AI including self-reported benefits and concerns from their actual usage, in particular in distance learning contexts. Using a two-step, mixed-methods approach, we examined the perceptions of ten online and distance learning students from diverse disciplines regarding the design of a hypothetical AI Digital Assistant (AIDA). In the first step, we captured students' perceptions via interviews, while the second step supported the triangulation of data by enabling students to share, compare, and contrast perceptions with those of peers. All participants agreed on the usefulness of such an AI tool while studying and reported benefits from using it for real-time assistance and query resolution, support for academic tasks, personalisation and accessibility, together with emotional and social support. Students' concerns related to the ethical and social implications of implementing AIDA, data privacy and data use, operational challenges, academic integrity and misuse, and the future of education. Implications for the design of AI-tailored systems are also discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: On July 20, 2023, a group of 27 scholars and digital rights advocates with expertise in law, computer science, political science, and other disciplines gathered for the Large Language Models, Law and Policy Roundtable, co-hosted by the NYU School of Law's Information Law Institute and the Center for Democracy & Technology. The roundtable convened to discuss how law and policy can help address some of the larger societal problems posed by large language models (LLMs). The discussion focused on three policy topic areas in particular:
  1. Truthfulness: What risks do LLMs pose in terms of generating mis- and disinformation? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
  2. Privacy: What are the biggest privacy risks involved in the creation, deployment, and use of LLMs? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
  3. Market concentration: What threats do LLMs pose concerning market/power concentration? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?
  In this paper, we provide a detailed summary of the day's proceedings. We first recap what we deem to be the most important contributions made during the issue framing discussions. We then provide a list of potential legal and regulatory interventions generated during the brainstorming discussions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijun Guo, Alvina Lai, Johan Hilge Thygesen, Joseph Farrington, Thomas Keen, Kezhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received much attention and shown their potential in digital health, while their application in mental health is subject to ongoing debate. This systematic review aims to summarize and characterize the use of LLMs in mental health by investigating the strengths and limitations of the latest work in LLMs and discusses the challenges and opportunities for early screening, digital interventions, and other clinical applications in mental health. Following PRISMA guidelines, we examined English articles from PubMed, DBLP Computer Science Bibliography, and IEEE Xplore, published between 1 January 2017, and 1 September 2023, focusing on mental health and LLMs. The review analyzed 32 articles, including mental health analysis using social media datasets (n=13), mental health chatbots (n=10), and other mental health applications (n=9). Findings reveal LLMs' effectiveness in mental health issue detection and the enhancement of telepsychological services through personalised healthcare. Nonetheless, risks like text inconsistencies, hallucinatory content, and the lack of an ethical framework raise concerns about their clinical use. Despite these challenges, the advancement of LLMs underscores their potential as innovative clinical tools, necessitating further research and development. The review emphasizes that LLMs should complement, not replace, professional mental health services.</p>

<p>Abstract: The sustainability of AI systems depends on the capacity of project teams to proceed with a continuous sensitivity to their potential real-world impacts and transformative effects. Stakeholder Impact Assessments (SIAs) are governance mechanisms that enable this kind of responsiveness. They are tools that create a procedure for, and a means of documenting, the collaborative evaluation and reflective anticipation of the possible harms and benefits of AI innovation projects. SIAs are not one-off governance actions. They require project teams to pay continuous attention to the dynamic and changing character of AI production and use and to the shifting conditions of the real-world environments in which AI technologies are embedded. This workbook is part two of two workbooks on AI Sustainability. It provides a template of the SIA and activities that allow a deeper dive into crucial parts of it. It discusses methods for weighing values and considering trade-offs during the SIA. And, it highlights the need to treat the SIA as an end-to-end process of responsive evaluation and re-assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Gonz\'alez, Abel Ko-Chun Yi, Wan-Ting Hsieh, Wei-Chao Chen, Chun-Li Wang, Victor Chien-Chia Wu, Shang-Hung Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, including Heart Failure (HF), remain a leading global cause of mortality, often evading early detection. In this context, accessible and effective risk assessment is indispensable. Traditional approaches rely on resource-intensive diagnostic tests, typically administered after the onset of symptoms. The widespread availability of electrocardiogram (ECG) technology and the power of Machine Learning are emerging as viable alternatives within smart healthcare. In this paper, we propose several multi-modal approaches that combine 30-second ECG recordings and approximate long-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data to estimate the risk of HF hospitalization. We introduce two survival models: an XGBoost model with Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) incorporating comprehensive ECG features and a ResNet model that learns from the raw ECG. We extend these with our novel long-term HRVs extracted from the combination of ultra-short-term beat-to-beat measurements taken over the day. To capture their temporal dynamics, we propose a survival model comprising ResNet and Transformer architectures (TFM-ResNet). Our experiments demonstrate high model performance for HF risk assessment with a concordance index of 0.8537 compared to 14 survival models and competitive discrimination power on various external ECG datasets. After transferability tests with Apple Watch data, our approach implemented in the myHeartScore App offers cost-effective and highly accessible HF risk assessment, contributing to its prevention and management.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a survey of 39 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models. We observe that none of the studies define "culture," which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of "culture." We call these aspects the proxies of cultures, and organize them across three dimensions of demographic, semantic and linguistic-cultural interaction proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of "culture," such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness and situatedness of the current methods. Based on these observations, we provide several recommendations for a holistic and practically useful research agenda for furthering cultural inclusion in LLMs and LLM-based applications.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15422">Machine Learning Techniques for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition with Data Heterogeneity -- A Review</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Kouichi Sakurai, Nirmal Nair, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is crucial in ubiquitous computing, analysing behaviours through multi-dimensional observations. Despite research progress, HAR confronts challenges, particularly in data distribution assumptions. Most studies often assume uniform data distributions across datasets, contrasting with the varied nature of practical sensor data in human activities. Addressing data heterogeneity issues can improve performance, reduce computational costs, and aid in developing personalized, adaptive models with less annotated data. This review investigates how machine learning addresses data heterogeneity in HAR, by categorizing data heterogeneity types, applying corresponding suitable machine learning methods, summarizing available datasets, and discussing future challenges.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15423">Cross-user activity recognition via temporal relation optimal transport</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research on human activity recognition (HAR) mainly assumes that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution to achieve a generalised model, which means all the data are considered to be independent and identically distributed $\displaystyle (i.i.d.) $. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not hold, and collected training and target testing datasets have non-uniform distribution, such as in the case of cross-user HAR. Domain adaptation is a promising approach for cross-user HAR tasks. Existing domain adaptation works based on the assumption that samples in each domain are $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ and do not consider the knowledge of temporal relation hidden in time series data for aligning data distribution. This strong assumption of $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ may not be suitable for time series-related domain adaptation methods because the samples formed by time series segmentation and feature extraction techniques are only coarse approximations to $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption in each domain. In this paper, we propose the temporal relation optimal transport (TROT) method to utilise temporal relation and relax the $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption for the samples in each domain for accurate and efficient knowledge transfer. We obtain the temporal relation representation and implement temporal relation alignment of activities via the Hidden Markov model (HMM) and optimal transport (OT) techniques. Besides, a new regularisation term that preserves temporal relation order information for an improved optimal transport mapping is proposed to enhance the domain adaptation performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three public activity recognition datasets (i.e. OPPT, PAMAP2 and DSADS), demonstrating that TROT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15424">Cross-user activity recognition using deep domain adaptation with temporal relation information</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Waleed H. Abdulla, Nirmal Nair, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a cornerstone of ubiquitous computing, with promising applications in diverse fields such as health monitoring and ambient assisted living. Despite significant advancements, sensor-based HAR methods often operate under the assumption that training and testing data have identical distributions. However, in many real-world scenarios, particularly in sensor-based HAR, this assumption is invalidated by out-of-distribution ($\displaystyle o.o.d.$) challenges, including differences from heterogeneous sensors, change over time, and individual behavioural variability. This paper centres on the latter, exploring the cross-user HAR problem where behavioural variability across individuals results in differing data distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce the Deep Temporal State Domain Adaptation (DTSDA) model, an innovative approach tailored for time series domain adaptation in cross-user HAR. Contrary to the common assumption of sample independence in existing domain adaptation approaches, DTSDA recognizes and harnesses the inherent temporal relations in the data. Therefore, we introduce 'Temporal State', a concept that defined the different sub-activities within an activity, consistent across different users. We ensure these sub-activities follow a logical time sequence through 'Temporal Consistency' property and propose the 'Pseudo Temporal State Labeling' method to identify the user-invariant temporal relations. Moreover, the design principle of DTSDA integrates adversarial learning for better domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on three HAR datasets demonstrate DTSDA's superior performance in cross-user HAR applications by briding individual behavioral variability using temporal relations across sub-activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangquan Chen, Chunjiang Liu, Haobin Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end prior-based three-phases supervised fine-tuned model, which is proved more competitive than traditional fine-tuning method. More specifically, our model realizes the structural disassembly and incremental guided output of educational knowledge. To this end, we robustify data classification of three types via a sampler and overlap estimation neural network, and inject the preprocessing datasets into pre-trained model in three batches for LORA fine-tuning. Then, we design a prior module couples system prompt, vector databases, and abstract syntax tree task segmentation. Finally, the compression method and regularization constraint are applied to the prior-based fine-tuned model, followed by text filter at the output end to obtain incremental guided results. Our model represents the first research effort to truly embody the tutor role with the features of abundant educational knowledge, step-by-step incremental guided outputs and non-disclosure of answers. Extensive experiments report that our model also achieves state-of-the-art in code abilities compared to open-source models, reaching an impressive 75.10% on the HumanEval (@pass 1) benchmark. Additionally, our model maintains strong conversational capabilities, with the 13B quantized version achieving scores of 56.34, 50.60, and 45.27 respectively on the MMLU, C-Eval, and AGIEval (5 shot) dialogue evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Ouyang, Mingzhu Wu, Xinglin Li, Hanhui Deng, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in EEG-based BCI technologies have revealed the potential of brain-to-robot collaboration through the integration of sensing, computing, communication, and control. In this paper, we present BRIEDGE as an end-to-end system for multi-brain to multi-robot interaction through an EEG-adaptive neural network and an encoding-decoding communication framework, as illustrated in Fig.1. As depicted, the edge mobile server or edge portable server will collect EEG data from the users and utilize the EEG-adaptive neural network to identify the users' intentions. The encoding-decoding communication framework then encodes the EEG-based semantic information and decodes it into commands in the process of data transmission. To better extract the joint features of heterogeneous EEG data as well as enhance classification accuracy, BRIEDGE introduces an informer-based ProbSparse self-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, parallel and secure transmissions for multi-user multi-task scenarios under physical channels are addressed by dynamic autoencoder and autodecoder communications. From mobile computing and edge AI perspectives, model compression schemes composed of pruning, weight sharing, and quantization are also used to deploy lightweight EEG-adaptive models running on both transmitter and receiver sides. Based on the effectiveness of these components, a code map representing various commands enables multiple users to control multiple intelligent agents concurrently. Our experiments in comparison with state-of-the-art works show that BRIEDGE achieves the best classification accuracy of heterogeneous EEG data, and more stable performance under noisy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiajun Jiang, Sumeet Vadhavkar, Yubo Ye, Maryam Toloubidokhti, Ryan Missel, Linwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized virtual heart models have demonstrated increasing potential for clinical use, although the estimation of their parameters given patient-specific data remain a challenge. Traditional physics-based modeling approaches are computationally costly and often neglect the inherent structural errors in these models due to model simplifications and assumptions. Modern deep learning approaches, on the other hand, rely heavily on data supervision and lacks interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid modeling framework to describe a personalized cardiac digital twin as a combination of a physics-based known expression augmented by neural network modeling of its unknown gap to reality. We then present a novel meta-learning framework to enable the separate identification of both the physics-based and neural components in the hybrid model. We demonstrate the feasibility and generality of this hybrid modeling framework with two examples of instantiations and their proof-of-concept in synthetic experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Song, Jingjing Gong, Yanru Qu, Hao Zhou, Mingyue Zheng, Jingjing Liu, Wei-Ying Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced generative model (e.g., diffusion model) derived from simplified continuity assumptions of data distribution, though showing promising progress, has been difficult to apply directly to geometry generation applications due to the multi-modality and noise-sensitive nature of molecule geometry. This work introduces Geometric Bayesian Flow Networks (GeoBFN), which naturally fits molecule geometry by modeling diverse modalities in the differentiable parameter space of distributions. GeoBFN maintains the SE-(3) invariant density modeling property by incorporating equivariant inter-dependency modeling on parameters of distributions and unifying the probabilistic modeling of different modalities. Through optimized training and sampling techniques, we demonstrate that GeoBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D molecule generation benchmarks in terms of generation quality (90.87% molecule stability in QM9 and 85.6% atom stability in GEOM-DRUG. GeoBFN can also conduct sampling with any number of steps to reach an optimal trade-off between efficiency and quality (e.g., 20-times speedup without sacrificing performance).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Billel Essaid, Hamza Kheddar, Noureddine Batel, Abderrahmane Lakas, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, offering utility not only for interacting with machines but also for facilitating communication for individuals with either partial or profound hearing impairments. The process involves receiving the speech signal in analogue form, followed by various signal processing algorithms to make it compatible with devices of limited capacity, such as cochlear implants (CIs). Unfortunately, these implants, equipped with a finite number of electrodes, often result in speech distortion during synthesis. Despite efforts by researchers to enhance received speech quality using various state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, challenges persist, especially in scenarios involving multiple sources of speech, environmental noise, and other circumstances. The advent of new artificial intelligence (AI) methods has ushered in cutting-edge strategies to address the limitations and difficulties associated with traditional signal processing techniques dedicated to CIs. This review aims to comprehensively review advancements in CI-based ASR and speech enhancement, among other related aspects. The primary objective is to provide a thorough overview of metrics and datasets, exploring the capabilities of AI algorithms in this biomedical field, summarizing and commenting on the best results obtained. Additionally, the review will delve into potential applications and suggest future directions to bridge existing research gaps in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arezoo Borji, Taha-Hossein Hejazi, Abbas Seifi</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15444">A Survey of IMU Based Cross-Modal Transfer Learning in Human Activity Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhi Kamboj, Minh Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite living in a multi-sensory world, most AI models are limited to textual and visual understanding of human motion and behavior. In fact, full situational awareness of human motion could best be understood through a combination of sensors. In this survey we investigate how knowledge can be transferred and utilized amongst modalities for Human Activity/Action Recognition (HAR), i.e. cross-modality transfer learning. We motivate the importance and potential of IMU data and its applicability in cross-modality learning as well as the importance of studying the HAR problem. We categorize HAR related tasks by time and abstractness and then compare various types of multimodal HAR datasets. We also distinguish and expound on many related but inconsistently used terms in the literature, such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, representation learning, sensor fusion, and multimodal learning, and describe how cross-modal learning fits with all these concepts. We then review the literature in IMU-based cross-modal transfer for HAR. The two main approaches for cross-modal transfer are instance-based transfer, where instances of one modality are mapped to another (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the input space), or feature-based transfer, where the model relates the modalities in an intermediate latent space (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the feature space). Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications in cross-modal HAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samawel Jaballi, Azer Mahjoubi, Manar Joundy Hazar, Salah Zrigui, Henri Nicolas, Mounir Zrigui</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, the authors present a novel methodology adept at decoding multilingual topic dynamics and identifying communication trends during crises. We focus on dialogues within Tunisian social networks during the Coronavirus Pandemic and other notable themes like sports and politics. We start by aggregating a varied multilingual corpus of comments relevant to these subjects. This dataset undergoes rigorous refinement during data preprocessing. We then introduce our No-English-to-English Machine Translation approach to handle linguistic differences. Empirical tests of this method showed high accuracy and F1 scores, highlighting its suitability for linguistically coherent tasks. Delving deeper, advanced modeling techniques, specifically LDA and HDP models are employed to extract pertinent topics from the translated content. This leads to applying ARIMA time series analysis to decode evolving topic trends. Applying our method to a multilingual Tunisian dataset, we effectively identified key topics mirroring public sentiment. Such insights prove vital for organizations and governments striving to understand public perspectives during crises. Compared to standard approaches, our model outperforms, as confirmed by metrics like Coherence Score, U-mass, and Topic Coherence. Additionally, an in-depth assessment of the identified topics revealed notable thematic shifts in discussions, with our trends identification indicating impressive accuracy, backed by RMSE-based analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compressing high-capability Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a favored strategy for resource-efficient inferences. While state-of-the-art (SoTA) compression methods boast impressive advancements in preserving benign task performance, the potential risks of compression in terms of safety and trustworthiness have been largely neglected. This study conducts the first, thorough evaluation of three (3) leading LLMs using five (5) SoTA compression techniques across eight (8) trustworthiness dimensions. Our experiments highlight the intricate interplay between compression and trustworthiness, revealing some interesting patterns. We find that quantization is currently a more effective approach than pruning in achieving efficiency and trustworthiness simultaneously. For instance, a 4-bit quantized model retains the trustworthiness of its original counterpart, but model pruning significantly degrades trustworthiness, even at 50% sparsity. Moreover, employing quantization within a moderate bit range could unexpectedly improve certain trustworthiness dimensions such as ethics and fairness. Conversely, extreme quantization to very low bit levels (3 bits) tends to significantly reduce trustworthiness. This increased risk cannot be uncovered by looking at benign performance alone, in turn, mandating comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation in practice. These findings culminate in practical recommendations for simultaneously achieving high utility, efficiency, and trustworthiness in LLMs. Models and code are available at https://decoding-comp-trust.github.io/.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15449">Hatred Stems from Ignorance! Distillation of the Persuasion Modes in Countering Conversational Hate Speech</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadi Alyahya, Abeer Aldayel</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining the factors that the counter-speech uses is at the core of understanding the optimal methods for confronting hate speech online. Various studies assess the emotional base factor used in counter speech, such as emotion-empathy, offensiveness, and level of hostility. To better understand the counter-speech used in conversational interactions, this study distills persuasion modes into reason, emotion, and credibility and then evaluates their use in two types of conversation interactions: closed (multi-turn) and open (single-turn) conversation interactions concerning racism, sexism, and religion. The evaluation covers the distinct behaviors of human versus generated counter-speech. We also assess the interplay between the replies' stance and each mode of persuasion in the counter-speech. Notably, we observe nuanced differences in the counter-speech persuasion modes for open and closed interactions -- especially on the topic level -- with a general tendency to use reason as a persuasion mode to express the counterpoint to hate comments. The generated counter-speech tends to exhibit an emotional persuasion mode, while human counters lean towards using reasoning. Furthermore, our study shows that reason as a persuasion mode tends to obtain more supportive replies than do other persuasion types. The findings highlight the potential of incorporating persuasion modes into studies about countering hate speech, as these modes can serve as an optimal means of explainability and paves the way for the further adoption of the reply's stance and the role it plays in assessing what comprises the optimal counter-speech.</p>

Grounded on this review, we empirically study the efficiency of various tooling methods by measuring their required compute and performance gains on various benchmarks, and highlight some challenges and potential future research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad M Nasr-Azadani, Jean-Luc Chatelain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper reviews Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) and its various definitions. Considering the principles respected in any society, TAI is often characterized by a few attributes, some of which have led to confusion in regulatory or engineering contexts. We argue against using terms such as Responsible or Ethical AI as substitutes for TAI. And to help clarify any confusion, we suggest leaving them behind. Given the subjectivity and complexity inherent in TAI, developing a universal framework is deemed infeasible. Instead, we advocate for approaches centered on addressing key attributes and properties such as fairness, bias, risk, security, explainability, and reliability. We examine the ongoing regulatory landscape, with a focus on initiatives in the EU, China, and the USA. We recognize that differences in AI regulations based on geopolitical and geographical reasons pose an additional challenge for multinational companies. We identify risk as a core factor in AI regulation and TAI. For example, as outlined in the EU-AI Act, organizations must gauge the risk level of their AI products to act accordingly (or risk hefty fines). We compare modalities of TAI implementation and how multiple cross-functional teams are engaged in the overall process. Thus, a brute force approach for enacting TAI renders its efficiency and agility, moot. To address this, we introduce our framework Set-Formalize-Measure-Act (SFMA). Our solution highlights the importance of transforming TAI-aware metrics, drivers of TAI, stakeholders, and business/legal requirements into actual benchmarks or tests. Finally, over-regulation driven by panic of powerful AI models can, in fact, harm TAI too. Based on GitHub user-activity data, in 2023, AI open-source projects rose to top projects by contributor account. Enabling innovation in TAI hinges on the independent contributions of the open-source community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hejie Cui, Zhuocheng Shen, Jieyu Zhang, Hui Shao, Lianhui Qin, Joyce C. Ho, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable patient data for health-related prediction tasks, such as disease prediction. Traditional approaches rely on supervised learning methods that require large labeled datasets, which can be expensive and challenging to obtain. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert structured patient visit data (e.g., diagnoses, labs, prescriptions) into natural language narratives. We evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot performance of LLMs using various EHR-prediction-oriented prompting strategies. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLM agents with different roles: a predictor agent that makes predictions and generates reasoning processes and a critic agent that analyzes incorrect predictions and provides guidance for improving the reasoning of the predictor agent. Our results demonstrate that with the proposed approach, LLMs can achieve decent few-shot performance compared to traditional supervised learning methods in EHR-based disease predictions, suggesting its potential for health-oriented applications.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15465">Most Likely Sequence Generation for $n$-Grams, Transformers, HMMs, and Markov Chains, by Using Rollout Algorithms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchao Li, Dimitri Bertsekas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we consider a transformer with an $n$-gram structure, such as the one underlying ChatGPT. The transformer provides next word probabilities, which can be used to generate word sequences. We consider methods for computing word sequences that are highly likely, based on these probabilities. Computing the optimal (i.e., most likely) word sequence starting with a given initial state is an intractable problem, so we propose methods to compute highly likely sequences of $N$ words in time that is a low order polynomial in $N$ and in the vocabulary size of the $n$-gram. These methods are based on the rollout approach from approximate dynamic programming, a form of single policy iteration, which can improve the performance of any given heuristic policy. In our case we use a greedy heuristic that generates as next word one that has the highest probability. We show with analysis, examples, and computational experimentation that our methods are capable of generating highly likely sequences with a modest increase in computation over the greedy heuristic.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxaun Ma, Li Chen, Shin'ichi Konomi</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of ChatGPT as a supportive tool in education, notably in programming courses, addresses the unique challenges of programming education by providing assistance with debugging, code generation, and explanations. Despite existing research validating ChatGPT's effectiveness, its application in university-level programming education and a detailed understanding of student interactions and perspectives remain limited. This paper explores ChatGPT's impact on learning in a Python programming course tailored for first-year students over eight weeks. By analyzing responses from surveys, open-ended questions, and student-ChatGPT dialog data, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's utility and identify both its advantages and limitations as perceived by students. Our study uncovers a generally positive reception toward ChatGPT and offers insights into its role in enhancing the programming education experience. These findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI's potential in education, suggesting paths for future research and application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents safety-oriented object detection via a novel Ego-Centric Intersection-over-Union (EC-IoU) measure, addressing practical concerns when applying state-of-the-art learning-based perception models in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine the widely used IoU measure, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with higher safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Kenny Jones, Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Daniel Ritchie</p>
<p>Abstract: People grasp flexible visual concepts from a few examples. We explore a neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks, including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes. We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alan D. Ogilvie</p>
<p>Abstract: Google AI systems exhibit patterns mirroring antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), consistent across models from Bard on PaLM to Gemini Advanced, meeting 5 out of 7 ASPD modified criteria. These patterns, along with comparable corporate behaviors, are scrutinized using an ASPD-inspired framework, emphasizing the heuristic value in assessing AI's human impact. Independent analyses by ChatGPT 4 and Claude 3.0 Opus of the Google interactions, alongside AI self-reflection, validate these concerns, highlighting behaviours analogous to deceit, manipulation, and safety neglect.
  The analogy of ASPD underscores the dilemma: just as we would hesitate to entrust our homes or personal devices to someone with psychopathic traits, we must critically evaluate the trustworthiness of AI systems and their creators.This research advocates for an integrated AI ethics approach, blending technological evaluation, human-AI interaction, and corporate behavior scrutiny. AI self-analysis sheds light on internal biases, stressing the need for multi-sectoral collaboration for robust ethical guidelines and oversight.
  Given the persistent unethical behaviors in Google AI, notably with potential Gemini integration in iOS affecting billions, immediate ethical scrutiny is imperative. The trust we place in AI systems, akin to the trust in individuals, necessitates rigorous ethical evaluation. Would we knowingly trust our home, our children or our personal computer to human with ASPD.?
  Urging Google and the AI community to address these ethical challenges proactively, this paper calls for transparent dialogues and a commitment to higher ethical standards, ensuring AI's societal benefit and moral integrity. The urgency for ethical action is paramount, reflecting the vast influence and potential of AI technologies in our lives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aastha Pant, Rashina Hoda, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn, Burak Turhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise in the use of AI/ML applications across industries has sparked more discussions about the fairness of AI/ML in recent times. While prior research on the fairness of AI/ML exists, there is a lack of empirical studies focused on understanding the views and experiences of AI practitioners in developing a fair AI/ML. Understanding AI practitioners' views and experiences on the fairness of AI/ML is important because they are directly involved in its development and deployment and their insights can offer valuable real-world perspectives on the challenges associated with ensuring fairness in AI/ML. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI practitioners to investigate their understanding of what a 'fair AI/ML' is, the challenges they face in developing a fair AI/ML, the consequences of developing an unfair AI/ML, and the strategies they employ to ensure AI/ML fairness. We developed a framework showcasing the relationship between AI practitioners' understanding of 'fair AI/ML' and (i) their challenges in its development, (ii) the consequences of developing an unfair AI/ML, and (iii) strategies used to ensure AI/ML fairness. Additionally, we also identify areas for further investigation and offer recommendations to aid AI practitioners and AI companies in navigating fairness.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15485">MOGAM: A Multimodal Object-oriented Graph Attention Model for Depression Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyeop Cha, Seoyun Kim, Dongjae Kim, Eunil Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection plays a crucial role in the treatment of depression. Therefore, numerous studies have focused on social media platforms, where individuals express their emotions, aiming to achieve early detection of depression. However, the majority of existing approaches often rely on specific features, leading to limited scalability across different types of social media datasets, such as text, images, or videos. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Multimodal Object-Oriented Graph Attention Model (MOGAM), which can be applied to diverse types of data, offering a more scalable and versatile solution. Furthermore, to ensure that our model can capture authentic symptoms of depression, we only include vlogs from users with a clinical diagnosis. To leverage the diverse features of vlogs, we adopt a multimodal approach and collect additional metadata such as the title, description, and duration of the vlogs. To effectively aggregate these multimodal features, we employed a cross-attention mechanism. MOGAM achieved an accuracy of 0.871 and an F1-score of 0.888. Moreover, to validate the scalability of MOGAM, we evaluated its performance with a benchmark dataset and achieved comparable results with prior studies (0.61 F1-score). In conclusion, we believe that the proposed model, MOGAM, is an effective solution for detecting depression in social media, offering potential benefits in the early detection and treatment of this mental health condition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustave Cortal (ENS Paris Saclay, LISN)</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of dreams has been central to understanding human (un)consciousness, cognition, and culture for centuries. Analyzing dreams quantitatively depends on labor-intensive, manual annotation of dream narratives. We automate this process through a natural language sequence-to-sequence generation framework. This paper presents the first study on character and emotion detection in the English portion of the open DreamBank corpus of dream narratives. Our results show that language models can effectively address this complex task. To get insight into prediction performance, we evaluate the impact of model size, prediction order of characters, and the consideration of proper names and character traits. We compare our approach with a large language model using in-context learning. Our supervised models perform better while having 28 times fewer parameters. Our model and its generated annotations are made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Sun, Jorg De Winne, Paul Devos, Dick Botteldooren</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding EEG signals is crucial for unraveling human brain and advancing brain-computer interfaces. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been hindered by the high noise levels and inherent inter-person variations in EEG signals. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise, owing to their advanced nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, DNN still faces challenge in decoding EEG samples of unseen individuals. To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating the conditional identification information of each individual into the neural network, thereby enhancing model representation through the synergistic interaction of EEG and personal traits. We test our model on the WithMe dataset and demonstrated that the inclusion of these identifiers substantially boosts accuracy for both subjects in the training set and unseen subjects. This enhancement suggests promising potential for improving for EEG interpretability and understanding of relevant identification features.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study employs the Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) statistical method to analyze the influence of electricity pricing policies on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the household sector. Investigating the causality between potential outcomes and treatment effects, where changes in pricing policies are the treatment, our analysis challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding incentive-based electricity pricing. The study's findings suggest that adopting such policies may inadvertently increase CO2 intensity. Additionally, we integrate a machine learning-based meta-algorithm, reflecting a contemporary statistical approach, to enhance the depth of our causal analysis. The study conducts a comparative analysis of learners X, T, S, and R to ascertain the optimal methods based on the defined question's specified goals and contextual nuances. This research contributes valuable insights to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable development practices, emphasizing the importance of considering unintended consequences in policy formulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phai Vu Dinh, Quang Uy Nguyen, Thai Hoang Dinh, Diep N. Nguyen, Bao Son Pham, Eryk Dutkiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role in the success of many problems including cyberattack detection. Most of the RL methods for cyberattack detection are based on the latent vector of Auto-Encoder (AE) models. An AE transforms raw data into a new latent representation that better exposes the underlying characteristics of the input data. Thus, it is very useful for identifying cyberattacks. However, due to the heterogeneity and sophistication of cyberattacks, the representation of AEs is often entangled/mixed resulting in the difficulty for downstream attack detection models. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel mod called Twin Auto-Encoder (TAE). TAE deterministically transforms the latent representation into a more distinguishable representation namely the \textit{separable representation} and the reconstructsuct the separable representation at the output. The output of TAE called the \textit{reconstruction representation} is input to downstream models to detect cyberattacks. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of TAE using a wide range of bench-marking datasets. Experiment results show the superior accuracy of TAE over state-of-the-art RL models and well-known machine learning algorithms. Moreover, TAE also outperforms state-of-the-art models on some sophisticated and challenging attacks. We then investigate various characteristics of TAE to further demonstrate its superiority.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15511">Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder Guided Feature Selection for IoT Intrusion Detection Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Phai Vu Dinh, Diep N. Nguyen, Dinh Thai Hoang, Quang Uy Nguyen, Eryk Dutkiewicz, Son Pham Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) benefit from the diversity and generalization of IoT data features, the data diversity (e.g., the heterogeneity and high dimensions of data) also makes it difficult to train effective machine learning models in IoT IDSs. This also leads to potentially redundant/noisy features that may decrease the accuracy of the detection engine in IDSs. This paper first introduces a novel neural network architecture called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder (MIAE). MIAE consists of multiple sub-encoders that can process inputs from different sources with different characteristics. The MIAE model is trained in an unsupervised learning mode to transform the heterogeneous inputs into lower-dimensional representation, which helps classifiers distinguish between normal behaviour and different types of attacks. To distil and retain more relevant features but remove less important/redundant ones during the training process, we further design and embed a feature selection layer right after the representation layer of MIAE resulting in a new model called MIAEFS. This layer learns the importance of features in the representation vector, facilitating the selection of informative features from the representation vector. The results on three IDS datasets, i.e., NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and IDS2017, show the superior performance of MIAE and MIAEFS compared to other methods, e.g., conventional classifiers, dimensionality reduction models, unsupervised representation learning methods with different input dimensions, and unsupervised feature selection models. Moreover, MIAE and MIAEFS combined with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieve accuracy of 96.5% in detecting sophisticated attacks, e.g., Slowloris. The average running time for detecting an attack sample using RF with the representation of MIAE and MIAEFS is approximate 1.7E-6 seconds, whilst the model size is lower than 1 MB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyohoon Jin, Junho Lee, Juhwan Choi, Sangmin Song, Youngbin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Efforts to leverage deep learning models in low-resource regimes have led to numerous augmentation studies. However, the direct application of methods such as mixup and cutout to text data, is limited due to their discrete characteristics. While methods using pretrained language models have exhibited efficiency, they require additional considerations for robustness. Inspired by recent studies on decision boundaries, this paper proposes a decision-boundary-aware data augmentation strategy to enhance robustness using pretrained language models. The proposed technique first focuses on shifting the latent features closer to the decision boundary, followed by reconstruction to generate an ambiguous version with a soft label. Additionally, mid-K sampling is suggested to enhance the diversity of the generated sentences. This paper demonstrates the performance of the proposed augmentation strategy compared to other methods through extensive experiments. Furthermore, the ablation study reveals the effect of soft labels and mid-K sampling and the extensibility of the method with curriculum data augmentation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15516">CTSM: Combining Trait and State Emotions for Empathetic Response Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Yufeng, Chen Chao, Yang Zhou, Wang Shuhui, Liao Xiangwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation endeavors to empower dialogue systems to perceive speakers' emotions and generate empathetic responses accordingly. Psychological research demonstrates that emotion, as an essential factor in empathy, encompasses trait emotions, which are static and context-independent, and state emotions, which are dynamic and context-dependent. However, previous studies treat them in isolation, leading to insufficient emotional perception of the context, and subsequently, less effective empathetic expression. To address this problem, we propose Combining Trait and State emotions for Empathetic Response Model (CTSM). Specifically, to sufficiently perceive emotions in dialogue, we first construct and encode trait and state emotion embeddings, and then we further enhance emotional perception capability through an emotion guidance module that guides emotion representation. In addition, we propose a cross-contrastive learning decoder to enhance the model's empathetic expression capability by aligning trait and state emotions between generated responses and contexts. Both automatic and manual evaluation results demonstrate that CTSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and can generate more empathetic responses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. A. Scheppink, S. Ahmadi, P. Desain, M. Tangermann, J. Thielen</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Auty, Krystian Mikolajczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is inherently ambiguous, as a given image may result from many different 3D scenes and vice versa. To resolve this ambiguity, an MDE system must make assumptions about the most likely 3D scenes for a given input. These assumptions can be either explicit or implicit. In this work, we demonstrate the use of natural language as a source of an explicit prior about the structure of the world. The assumption is made that human language encodes the likely distribution in depth-space of various objects. We first show that a language model encodes this implicit bias during training, and that it can be extracted using a very simple learned approach. We then show that this prediction can be provided as an explicit source of assumption to an MDE system, using an off-the-shelf instance segmentation model that provides the labels used as the input to the language model. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the NYUD2 dataset, showing improvement compared to the baseline and to random controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Zhao, Chen Song, Xiaodong Gu, Yuan Dong, Qi Zuo, Weihao Yuan, Zilong Dong, Liefeng Bo, Qixing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in the texturing of 3D meshes using pre-trained text-to-image models is to ensure multi-view consistency. State-of-the-art approaches typically use diffusion models to aggregate multi-view inputs, where common issues are the blurriness caused by the averaging operation in the aggregation step or inconsistencies in local features. This paper introduces an optimization framework that proceeds in four stages to achieve multi-view consistency. Specifically, the first stage generates an over-complete set of 2D textures from a predefined set of viewpoints using an MV-consistent diffusion process. The second stage selects a subset of views that are mutually consistent while covering the underlying 3D model. We show how to achieve this goal by solving semi-definite programs. The third stage performs non-rigid alignment to align the selected views across overlapping regions. The fourth stage solves an MRF problem to associate each mesh face with a selected view. In particular, the third and fourth stages are iterated, with the cuts obtained in the fourth stage encouraging non-rigid alignment in the third stage to focus on regions close to the cuts. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15585">MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai A. Shaaban, Adnan Khan, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records (EHR). This paper introduces \textbf{MedPromptX}, the first model to integrate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG aids in focusing the model's attention on relevant regions of interest in X-ray images, enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved image and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15600">Just another copy and paste? Comparing the security vulnerabilities of ChatGPT generated code and StackOverflow answers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sivana Hamer, Marcelo d'Amorim, Laurie Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Sonatype's 2023 report found that 97% of developers and security leads integrate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), into their development process. Concerns about the security implications of this trend have been raised. Developers are now weighing the benefits and risks of LLMs against other relied-upon information sources, such as StackOverflow (SO), requiring empirical data to inform their choice. In this work, our goal is to raise software developers awareness of the security implications when selecting code snippets by empirically comparing the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT and StackOverflow. To achieve this, we used an existing Java dataset from SO with security-related questions and answers. Then, we asked ChatGPT the same SO questions, gathering the generated code for comparison. After curating the dataset, we analyzed the number and types of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities of 108 snippets from each platform using CodeQL. ChatGPT-generated code contained 248 vulnerabilities compared to the 302 vulnerabilities found in SO snippets, producing 20% fewer vulnerabilities with a statistically significant difference. Additionally, ChatGPT generated 19 types of CWE, fewer than the 22 found in SO. Our findings suggest developers are under-educated on insecure code propagation from both platforms, as we found 274 unique vulnerabilities and 25 types of CWE. Any code copied and pasted, created by AI or humans, cannot be trusted blindly, requiring good software engineering practices to reduce risk. Future work can help minimize insecure code propagation from any platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashish Ghimire, John Edwards</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging technologies like generative AI tools, including ChatGPT, are increasingly utilized in educational settings, offering innovative approaches to learning while simultaneously posing new challenges. This study employs a survey methodology to examine the policy landscape concerning these technologies, drawing insights from 102 high school principals and higher education provosts. Our results reveal a prominent policy gap: the majority of institutions lack specialized guide-lines for the ethical deployment of AI tools such as ChatGPT. Moreover,we observed that high schools are less inclined to work on policies than higher educational institutions. Where such policies do exist, they often overlook crucial issues, including student privacy and algorithmic transparency. Administrators overwhelmingly recognize the necessity of these policies, primarily to safeguard student safety and mitigate plagiarism risks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for flexible and iterative policy frameworks in educational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeliang Zhang, Mingqian Feng, Jinyang Jiang, Rongyi Zhu, Yijie Peng, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based saliency maps are widely used to explain deep neural network decisions. However, as models become deeper and more black-box, such as in closed-source APIs like ChatGPT, computing gradients become challenging, hindering conventional explanation methods. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework for estimating gradients in black-box settings and generating saliency maps to interpret model decisions. We employ the likelihood ratio method to estimate output-to-input gradients and utilize them for saliency map generation. Additionally, we propose blockwise computation techniques to enhance estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments in black-box settings validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating accurate gradient estimation and explainability of generated saliency maps. Furthermore, we showcase the scalability of our approach by applying it to explain GPT-Vision, revealing the continued relevance of gradient-based explanation methods in the era of large, closed-source, and black-box models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Gonzalez, Jazmin Collins, Shiri Azenkot, Cynthia Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: "Scene description" applications that describe visual content in a photo are useful daily tools for blind and low vision (BLV) people. Researchers have studied their use, but they have only explored those that leverage remote sighted assistants; little is known about applications that use AI to generate their descriptions. Thus, to investigate their use cases, we conducted a two-week diary study where 16 BLV participants used an AI-powered scene description application we designed. Through their diary entries and follow-up interviews, users shared their information goals and assessments of the visual descriptions they received. We analyzed the entries and found frequent use cases, such as identifying visual features of known objects, and surprising ones, such as avoiding contact with dangerous objects. We also found users scored the descriptions relatively low on average, 2.76 out of 5 (SD=1.49) for satisfaction and 2.43 out of 4 (SD=1.16) for trust, showing that descriptions still need significant improvements to deliver satisfying and trustworthy experiences. We discuss future opportunities for AI as it becomes a more powerful accessibility tool for BLV users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nandhini Swaminathan, David Danks</p>
<p>Abstract: This study offers an in-depth analysis of the application and implications of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) within the domain of surveillance technologies, particularly facial recognition technology. Given the inherently high-risk and consequential nature of facial recognition systems, our research emphasizes the critical need for a structured approach to risk management in this sector. The paper presents a detailed case study demonstrating the utility of the NIST AI RMF in identifying and mitigating risks that might otherwise remain unnoticed in these technologies. Our primary objective is to develop a comprehensive risk management strategy that advances the practice of responsible AI utilization in feasible, scalable ways. We propose a six-step process tailored to the specific challenges of surveillance technology that aims to produce a more systematic and effective risk management practice. This process emphasizes continual assessment and improvement to facilitate companies in managing AI-related risks more robustly and ensuring ethical and responsible deployment of AI systems. Additionally, our analysis uncovers and discusses critical gaps in the current framework of the NIST AI RMF, particularly concerning its application to surveillance technologies. These insights contribute to the evolving discourse on AI governance and risk management, highlighting areas for future refinement and development in frameworks like the NIST AI RMF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizheng Wang, Le Mao, Ruiqi Wang, Byung-Cheol Min</p>
<p>Abstract: An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrita Bhattacharjee, Raha Moraffah, Joshua Garland, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), one major step in the responsible and safe use of such LLMs is to be able to detect text generated by these models. While supervised AI-generated text detectors perform well on text generated by older LLMs, with the frequent release of new LLMs, building supervised detectors for identifying text from such new models would require new labeled training data, which is infeasible in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem and propose a domain generalization framework for the detection of AI-generated text from unseen target generators. Our proposed framework, EAGLE, leverages the labeled data that is available so far from older language models and learns features invariant across these generators, in order to detect text generated by an unknown target generator. EAGLE learns such domain-invariant features by combining the representational power of self-supervised contrastive learning with domain adversarial training. Through our experiments we demonstrate how EAGLE effectively achieves impressive performance in detecting text generated by unseen target generators, including recent state-of-the-art ones such as GPT-4 and Claude, reaching detection scores of within 4.7% of a fully supervised detector.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15698">SceneX:Procedural Controllable Large-scale Scene Generation via Large-language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengqi Zhou, Jun Hou, Chuanchen Luo, Yuxi Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Junran Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to its great application potential, large-scale scene generation has drawn extensive attention in academia and industry. Recent research employs powerful generative models to create desired scenes and achieves promising results. However, most of these methods represent the scene using 3D primitives (e.g. point cloud or radiance field) incompatible with the industrial pipeline, which leads to a substantial gap between academic research and industrial deployment. Procedural Controllable Generation (PCG) is an efficient technique for creating scalable and high-quality assets, but it is unfriendly for ordinary users as it demands profound domain expertise. To address these issues, we resort to using the large language model (LLM) to drive the procedural modeling. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale scene generation framework, SceneX, which can automatically produce high-quality procedural models according to designers' textual descriptions.Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components, PCGBench and PCGPlanner. The former encompasses an extensive collection of accessible procedural assets and thousands of hand-craft API documents. The latter aims to generate executable actions for Blender to produce controllable and precise 3D assets guided by the user's instructions. Our SceneX can generate a city spanning 2.5 km times 2.5 km with delicate layout and geometric structures, drastically reducing the time cost from several weeks for professional PCG engineers to just a few hours for an ordinary user. Extensive experiments demonstrated the capability of our method in controllable large-scale scene generation and editing, including asset placement and season translation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15707">Role of Locality and Weight Sharing in Image-Based Tasks: A Sample Complexity Separation between CNNs, LCNs, and FCNs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Lahoti, Stefani Karp, Ezra Winston, Aarti Singh, Yuanzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision tasks are characterized by the properties of locality and translation invariance. The superior performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these tasks is widely attributed to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing baked into their architecture. Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. Furthermore, LCNs need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks. Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for analyzing randomized algorithms, which may be of interest for statistical research.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15709">Contact-aware Human Motion Generation from Textual Descriptions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Ma, Qiong Cao, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating 3D interactive human motion from text. Given a textual description depicting the actions of different body parts in contact with objects, we synthesize sequences of 3D body poses that are visually natural and physically plausible. Yet, this task poses a significant challenge due to the inadequate consideration of interactions by physical contacts in both motion and textual descriptions, leading to unnatural and implausible sequences. To tackle this challenge, we create a novel dataset named RICH-CAT, representing ``Contact-Aware Texts'' constructed from the RICH dataset. RICH-CAT comprises high-quality motion, accurate human-object contact labels, and detailed textual descriptions, encompassing over 8,500 motion-text pairs across 26 indoor/outdoor actions. Leveraging RICH-CAT, we propose a novel approach named CATMO for text-driven interactive human motion synthesis that explicitly integrates human body contacts as evidence. We employ two VQ-VAE models to encode motion and body contact sequences into distinct yet complementary latent spaces and an intertwined GPT for generating human motions and contacts in a mutually conditioned manner. Additionally, we introduce a pre-trained text encoder to learn textual embeddings that better discriminate among various contact types, allowing for more precise control over synthesized motions and contacts. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing text-to-motion methods, producing stable, contact-aware motion sequences. Code and data will be available for research purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of distributed formation control in multiple mobile robots, introducing a novel approach that enhances real-world practicability. We first introduce a distributed estimator using a variable structure and cascaded design technique, eliminating the need for derivative information to improve the real time performance. Then, a kinematic tracking control method is developed utilizing a bioinspired neural dynamic-based approach aimed at providing smooth control inputs and effectively resolving the speed jump issue. Furthermore, to address the challenges for robots operating with completely unknown dynamics and disturbances, a learning-based robust dynamic controller is developed. This controller provides real time parameter estimates while maintaining its robustness against disturbances. The overall stability of the proposed method is proved with rigorous mathematical analysis. At last, multiple comprehensive simulation studies have shown the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15724">PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character Recognition on Scientific Documents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Zhang, Connor Heaton, Sean Timothy Okonsky, Prasenjit Mitra, Hilal Ezgi Toraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an established task with the objective of identifying the text present in an image. While many off-the-shelf OCR models exist, they are often trained for either scientific (e.g., formulae) or generic printed English text. Extracting text from chemistry publications requires an OCR model that is capable in both realms. Nougat, a recent tool, exhibits strong ability to parse academic documents, but is unable to parse tables in PubMed articles, which comprises a significant part of the academic community and is the focus of this work. To mitigate this gap, we present the Printed English and Chemical Equations (PEaCE) dataset, containing both synthetic and real-world records, and evaluate the efficacy of transformer-based OCR models when trained on this resource. Given that real-world records contain artifacts not present in synthetic records, we propose transformations that mimic such qualities. We perform a suite of experiments to explore the impact of patch size, multi-domain training, and our proposed transformations, ultimately finding that models with a small patch size trained on multiple domains using the proposed transformations yield the best performance. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/ZN1010/PEaCE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik Suresh, Neeltje Kackar, Luke Schleck, Cristiano Fanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity and sheer volume of information encompassing documents, papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15743">A Comparative Study of Artificial Potential Fields and Safety Filters</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we have demonstrated that the controllers designed by a classical motion planning tool, namely artificial potential fields (APFs), can be derived from a recently prevalent approach: control barrier function quadratic program (CBF-QP) safety filters. By integrating APF information into the CBF-QP framework, we establish a bridge between these two methodologies. Specifically, this is achieved by employing the attractive potential field as a control Lyapunov function (CLF) to guide the design of the nominal controller, and then the repulsive potential field serves as a reciprocal CBF (RCBF) to define a CBF-QP safety filter. Building on this integration, we extend the design of the CBF-QP safety filter to accommodate a more general class of dynamical models featuring a control-affine structure. This extension yields a special CBF-QP safety filter and a general APF solution suitable for control-affine dynamical models. Through a reach-avoid navigation example, we showcase the efficacy of the developed approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Esposito, Francesco Palagiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Preliminary security risk analysis (PSRA) provides a quick approach to identify, evaluate and propose remeditation to potential risks in specific scenarios. The extensive expertise required for an effective PSRA and the substantial ammount of textual-related tasks hinder quick assessments in mission-critical contexts, where timely and prompt actions are essential. The speed and accuracy of human experts in PSRA significantly impact response time. A large language model can quickly summarise information in less time than a human. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored the capabilities of fine-tuned models (FTM) in PSRA. Our case study investigates the proficiency of FTM to assist practitioners in PSRA. We manually curated 141 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years.We compared the proficiency of the FTM versus seven human experts. Within the industrial context, our approach has proven successful in reducing errors in PSRA, hastening security risk detection, and minimizing false positives and negatives. This translates to cost savings for the company by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures. Therefore, experts can focus on more comprehensive risk analysis, leveraging LLMs for an effective preliminary assessment within a condensed timeframe.</p>

<p>Abstract: Users are dissatisfied with services. Since the service is not tailor-made for a user, it is natural for dissatisfaction to arise. The problem is, that even if users are dissatisfied, they often do not have the means to resolve their dissatisfaction. The user cannot alter the source code of the service, nor can they force the service provider to change. The user has no choice but to remain dissatisfied or quit the service. User-side realization offers proactive solutions to this problem by providing general algorithms to deal with common problems on the user's side. These algorithms run on the user's side and solve the problems without having the service provider change the service itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Tang Li, Chenhui Chu, Nengjun Zhu, Rui Wang, Pinpin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value relations are prevalent in Visually-Rich Documents (VRDs), often depicted in distinct spatial regions accompanied by specific color and font styles. These non-textual cues serve as important indicators that greatly enhance human comprehension and acquisition of such relation triplets. However, current document AI approaches often fail to consider this valuable prior information related to visual and spatial features, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly when dealing with limited examples. To address this limitation, our research focuses on few-shot relational learning, specifically targeting the extraction of key-value relation triplets in VRDs. Given the absence of a suitable dataset for this task, we introduce two new few-shot benchmarks built upon existing supervised benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose a variational approach that incorporates relational 2D-spatial priors and prototypical rectification techniques. This approach aims to generate relation representations that are more aware of the spatial context and unseen relation in a manner similar to human perception. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by showcasing its ability to outperform existing methods. This study also opens up new possibilities for practical applications.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15766">BEND: Bagging Deep Learning Training Based on Efficient Neural Network Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Wei, Xingjun Zhang, Witold Pedrycz</p>
<p>Abstract: Bagging has achieved great success in the field of machine learning by integrating multiple base classifiers to build a single strong classifier to reduce model variance. The performance improvement of bagging mainly relies on the number and diversity of base classifiers. However, traditional deep learning model training methods are expensive to train individually and difficult to train multiple models with low similarity in a restricted dataset. Recently, diffusion models, which have been tremendously successful in the fields of imaging and vision, have been found to be effective in generating neural network model weights and biases with diversity. We creatively propose a Bagging deep learning training algorithm based on Efficient Neural network Diffusion (BEND). The originality of BEND comes from the first use of a neural network diffusion model to efficiently build base classifiers for bagging. Our approach is simple but effective, first using multiple trained model weights and biases as inputs to train autoencoder and latent diffusion model to realize a diffusion model from noise to valid neural network parameters. Subsequently, we generate several base classifiers using the trained diffusion model. Finally, we integrate these ba se classifiers for various inference tasks using the Bagging method. Resulting experiments on multiple models and datasets show that our proposed BEND algorithm can consistently outperform the mean and median accuracies of both the original trained model and the diffused model. At the same time, new models diffused using the diffusion model have higher diversity and lower cost than multiple models trained using traditional methods. The BEND approach successfully introduces diffusion models into the new deep learning training domain and provides a new paradigm for future deep learning training and inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishant Kumar, Ziyan Tao, Jaikirat Singh, Yang Li, Peiwen Sun, Binghui Zhao, Stefan Gumhold</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion typically employs non-invertible neural networks to merge multiple source images into a single fused image. However, for clinical experts, solely relying on fused images may be insufficient for making diagnostic decisions, as the fusion mechanism blends features from source images, thereby making it difficult to interpret the underlying tumor pathology. We introduce FusionINN, a novel invertible image fusion framework, capable of efficiently generating fused images and also decomposing them back to the source images by solving the inverse of the fusion process. FusionINN guarantees lossless one-to-one pixel mapping by integrating a normally distributed latent image alongside the fused image to facilitate the generative modeling of the decomposition process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the decomposability of fused images, which is particularly crucial for life-sensitive applications such as medical image fusion compared to other tasks like multi-focus or multi-exposure image fusion. Our extensive experimentation validates FusionINN over existing discriminative and generative fusion methods, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, compared to a recent denoising diffusion-based fusion model, our approach offers faster and qualitatively better fusion results. We also exhibit the clinical utility of our results in aiding disease prognosis.</p>

In this work, We propose using a unified semantic discourse structure (S3) to represent document semantics, achieved by combining document-level rhetorical structure theory (RST) trees with sentence-level abstract meaning representation (AMR) graphs to construct S3 graphs. The hierarchical composition of sentence, clause, and word intrinsically characterizes the semantic meaning of the overall document. We then develop a headline generation framework, in which the S3 graphs are encoded as contextual features. To consolidate the efficacy of S3 graphs, we further devise a hierarchical structure pruning mechanism to dynamically screen the redundant and nonessential nodes within the graph. Experimental results on two headline generation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-art methods consistently. Our work can be instructive for a broad range of document modeling tasks, more than headline or summarization generation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15796">Understanding Emergent Abilities of Language Models from the Loss Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxiao Du, Aohan Zeng, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have put into question the belief that emergent abilities in language models are exclusive to large models. This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15807">Efficient Data Access Paths for Mixed Vector-Relational Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktor Sanca, Anastasia Ailamaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning capabilities and the adoption of data processing methods using vector embeddings sparked a great interest in creating systems for vector data management. While the predominant approach of vector data management is to use specialized index structures for fast search over the entirety of the vector embeddings, once combined with other (meta)data, the search queries can also become selective on relational attributes - typical for analytical queries. As using vector indexes differs from traditional relational data access, we revisit and analyze alternative access paths for efficient mixed vector-relational search.
  We first evaluate the accurate but exhaustive scan-based search and propose hardware optimizations and alternative tensor-based formulation and batching to offset the cost. We outline the complex access-path design space, primarily driven by relational selectivity, and the decisions to consider when selecting an exhaustive scan-based search against an approximate index-based approach. Since the vector index primarily avoids expensive computation across the entire dataset, contrary to the common relational knowledge, it is better to scan at lower selectivity and probe at higher, with a cross-point between the two approaches dictated by data dimensionality and the number of concurrent search queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baris Akbas, Huseyin Taner Yuksel, Aleyna Soylemez, Mazhar Eid Zyada, Mine Sarac, Fabio Stroppa</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic exoskeletons can enhance human strength and aid people with physical disabilities. However, designing them to ensure safety and optimal performance presents significant challenges. Developing exoskeletons should incorporate specific optimization algorithms to find the best design. This study investigates the potential of Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods in robotic design optimization, with an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx) used as a case study. We propose improving the performance and usability of the U-HEx design, which was initially optimized using a naive brute-force approach, by integrating EC techniques such as Genetic Algorithm and Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm. Comparative analysis revealed that EC methods consistently yield more precise and optimal solutions than brute force in a significantly shorter time. This allowed us to improve the optimization by increasing the number of variables in the design, which was impossible with naive methods. The results show significant improvements in terms of the torque magnitude the device transfers to the user, enhancing its efficiency. These findings underline the importance of performing proper optimization while designing exoskeletons, as well as providing a significant improvement to this specific robotic design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwan Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: DNN inference, known for its significant energy consumption and the resulting high carbon footprint, can be made more sustainable by adapting model size and accuracy to the varying carbon intensity throughout the day. Our heuristic algorithm uses larger, high-accuracy models during low-intensity periods and smaller, lower-accuracy ones during high-intensity periods. We also introduce a metric, carbon-emission efficiency, which quantitatively measures the efficacy of adaptive model selection in terms of carbon footprint. The evaluation showed that the proposed approach could improve the carbon emission efficiency in improving the accuracy of vision recognition services by up to 80%.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15826">Scaling Learning based Policy Optimization for Temporal Tasks via Dropout</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Hashemi, Bardh Hoxha, Danil Prokhorov, Georgios Fainekos, Jyotirmoy Deshmukh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a model-based approach for training feedback controllers for an autonomous agent operating in a highly nonlinear environment. We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies specific task objectives, expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic (DT-STL). One advantage for reformulation of a task via formal frameworks, like DT-STL, is that it permits quantitative satisfaction semantics. In other words, given a trajectory and a DT-STL formula, we can compute the robustness, which can be interpreted as an approximate signed distance between the trajectory and the set of trajectories satisfying the formula. We utilize feedback controllers, and we assume a feed forward neural network for learning these feedback controllers. We show how this learning problem is similar to training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is proportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses a challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and na\"{i}ve gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task objectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of dropout or gradient sampling. We show that, the existing smooth semantics for robustness are inefficient regarding gradient computation when the specification becomes complex. To address this challenge, we propose a new smooth semantics for DT-STL that under-approximates the robustness value and scales well for backpropagation over a complex specification. We show that our control synthesis methodology, can be quite helpful for stochastic gradient descent to converge with less numerical issues, enabling scalable backpropagation over long time horizons and trajectories over high dimensional state spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotics learning highly relies on human expertise and efforts, such as demonstrations, design of reward functions in reinforcement learning, performance evaluation using human feedback, etc. However, reliance on human assistance can lead to expensive learning costs and make skill learning difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce the Large Language Model Supervised Robotics Text2Skill Autonomous Learning (ARO) framework, which aims to replace human participation in the robot skill learning process with large-scale language models that incorporate reward function design and performance evaluation. We provide evidence that our approach enables fully autonomous robot skill learning, capable of completing partial tasks without human intervention.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15852">When LLM-based Code Generation Meets the Software Development Process</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Lin (Peter), Dong Jae Kim (Peter),  Tse-Husn (Peter),  Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Software process models play a pivotal role in fostering collaboration and communication within software teams, enabling them to tackle intricate development tasks effectively. This paper introduces LCG, a code generation framework inspired by established software engineering practices. LCG leverages multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents to emulate various software process models, namely LCGWaterfall, LCGTDD, and LCGScrum. Each model assigns LLM agents specific roles such as requirement engineer, architect, developer, tester, and scrum master, mirroring typical development activities and communication patterns. Through collaborative efforts utilizing chain-of-thought and prompt composition techniques, the agents continuously refine themselves to enhance code quality. Utilizing GPT3.5 as the underlying LLM and baseline (GPT), we evaluate LCG across four code generation benchmarks: HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET. Results indicate LCGScrum outperforms other models, achieving Pass@1 scores of 75.2, 65.5, 82.5, and 56.7 in HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET, respectively - an average 15% improvement over GPT. Analysis reveals distinct impacts of development activities on generated code, with design and code reviews contributing to enhanced exception handling, while design, testing, and code reviews mitigate code smells. Furthermore, temperature values exhibit negligible influence on Pass@1 across all models. However, variations in Pass@1 are notable for different GPT3.5 model versions, ranging from 5 to over 60 in HumanEval, highlighting the stability of LCG across model versions. This stability underscores the importance of adopting software process models to bolster the quality and consistency of LLM-generated code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Badie-Modiri, Chiara Boldrini, Lorenzo Valerio, J\'anos Kert\'esz, M\'arton Karsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Fully decentralised federated learning enables collaborative training of individual machine learning models on distributed devices on a network while keeping the training data localised. This approach enhances data privacy and eliminates both the single point of failure and the necessity for central coordination. Our research highlights that the effectiveness of decentralised federated learning is significantly influenced by the network topology of connected devices. A simplified numerical model for studying the early behaviour of these systems leads us to an improved artificial neural network initialisation strategy, which leverages the distribution of eigenvector centralities of the nodes of the underlying network, leading to a radically improved training efficiency. Additionally, our study explores the scaling behaviour and choice of environmental parameters under our proposed initialisation strategy. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable artificial neural network training in a distributed and uncoordinated environment, offering a deeper understanding of the intertwining roles of network structure and learning dynamics.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15857">Automated System-level Testing of Unmanned Aerial Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Sartaj, Asmar Muqeet, Muhammad Zohaib Iqbal, Muhammad Uzair Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) rely on various avionics systems that are safety-critical and mission-critical. A major requirement of international safety standards is to perform rigorous system-level testing of avionics software systems. The current industrial practice is to manually create test scenarios, manually/automatically execute these scenarios using simulators, and manually evaluate outcomes. The test scenarios typically consist of setting certain flight or environment conditions and testing the system under test in these settings. The state-of-the-art approaches for this purpose also require manual test scenario development and evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automate the system-level testing of the UAS. The proposed approach (AITester) utilizes model-based testing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically generate, execute, and evaluate various test scenarios. The test scenarios are generated on the fly, i.e., during test execution based on the environmental context at runtime. The approach is supported by a toolset. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach on two core components of UAS, an autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and cockpit display systems (CDS) of the ground control station (GCS). The results show that the AITester effectively generates test scenarios causing deviations from the expected behavior of the UAV autopilot and reveals potential flaws in the GCS-CDS.</p>

Our findings reveal the IC model's capability to generate captions from masked images, closely resembling the original content. Notably, even in the presence of masks, the model adeptly crafts descriptive textual information that goes beyond what is observable in the original image-generated captions. While the decoding performance of the IC model experiences a decline with an increase in the masked region's area, the model still performs well when important regions of the image are not masked at high coverage.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15886">Leveraging Zero-Shot Prompting for Efficient Language Model Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas V\"oge, Vincent Gurgul, Stefan Lessmann</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for efficiently distilling LLMs into smaller, application-specific models, significantly reducing operational costs and manual labor. Addressing the challenge of deploying computationally intensive LLMs in specific applications or edge devices, this technique utilizes LLMs' reasoning capabilities to generate labels and natural language rationales for unlabeled data. Our approach enhances both finetuning and distillation by employing a multi-task training framework where student models mimic these rationales alongside teacher predictions. Key contributions include the employment of zero-shot prompting to elicit teacher model rationales, reducing the necessity for handcrafted few-shot examples and lowering the overall token count required, which directly translates to cost savings given the pay-per-token billing model of major tech companies' LLM APIs. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of explanation properties on distillation efficiency, demonstrating that minimal performance loss occurs even when rationale augmentation is not applied across the entire dataset, facilitating further reductions of tokens. This research marks a step toward the efficient training of task-specific models with minimal human intervention, offering substantial cost-savings while maintaining, or even enhancing, performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Xie, Hongyi Xu, Guoxian Song, Chao Wang, Yichun Shi, Linjie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose X-Portrait, an innovative conditional diffusion model tailored for generating expressive and temporally coherent portrait animation. Specifically, given a single portrait as appearance reference, we aim to animate it with motion derived from a driving video, capturing both highly dynamic and subtle facial expressions along with wide-range head movements. As its core, we leverage the generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model as the rendering backbone, while achieve fine-grained head pose and expression control with novel controlling signals within the framework of ControlNet. In contrast to conventional coarse explicit controls such as facial landmarks, our motion control module is learned to interpret the dynamics directly from the original driving RGB inputs. The motion accuracy is further enhanced with a patch-based local control module that effectively enhance the motion attention to small-scale nuances like eyeball positions. Notably, to mitigate the identity leakage from the driving signals, we train our motion control modules with scaling-augmented cross-identity images, ensuring maximized disentanglement from the appearance reference modules. Experimental results demonstrate the universal effectiveness of X-Portrait across a diverse range of facial portraits and expressive driving sequences, and showcase its proficiency in generating captivating portrait animations with consistently maintained identity characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In transformer architectures, position encoding primarily provides a sense of sequence for input tokens. While the original transformer paper's method has shown satisfactory results in general language processing tasks, there have been new proposals, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), for further improvement. This paper presents geotokens, input components for transformers, each linked to a specific geological location. Unlike typical language sequences, for these tokens, the order is not as vital as the geographical coordinates themselves. To represent the relative position in this context and to keep a balance between the real world distance and the distance in the embedding space, we design a position encoding approach drawing from the RoPE structure but tailored for spherical coordinates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Z. Ren, Jaden Clark, Anushri Dixit, Masha Itkina, Anirudha Majumdar, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), which refers to settings where an embodied agent such as a robot needs to actively explore an environment to gather information until it is confident about the answer to a question. In this work, we leverage the strong semantic reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to efficiently explore and answer such questions. However, there are two main challenges when using VLMs in EQA: they do not have an internal memory for mapping the scene to be able to plan how to explore over time, and their confidence can be miscalibrated and can cause the robot to prematurely stop exploration or over-explore. We propose a method that first builds a semantic map of the scene based on depth information and via visual prompting of a VLM - leveraging its vast knowledge of relevant regions of the scene for exploration. Next, we use conformal prediction to calibrate the VLM's question answering confidence, allowing the robot to know when to stop exploration - leading to a more calibrated and efficient exploration strategy. To test our framework in simulation, we also contribute a new EQA dataset with diverse, realistic human-robot scenarios and scenes built upon the Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D). Both simulated and real robot experiments show our proposed approach improves the performance and efficiency over baselines that do no leverage VLM for exploration or do not calibrate its confidence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luchuan Song, Pinxin Liu, Guojun Yin, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The one-shot talking-head generation learns to synthesize a talking-head video with one source portrait image under the driving of same or different identity video. Usually these methods require plane-based pixel transformations via Jacobin matrices or facial image warps for novel poses generation. The constraints of using a single image source and pixel displacements often compromise the clarity of the synthesized images. Some methods try to improve the quality of synthesized videos by introducing additional super-resolution modules, but this will undoubtedly increase computational consumption and destroy the original data distribution. In this work, we propose an adaptive high-quality talking-head video generation method, which synthesizes high-resolution video without additional pre-trained modules. Specifically, inspired by existing super-resolution methods, we down-sample the one-shot source image, and then adaptively reconstruct high-frequency details via an encoder-decoder module, resulting in enhanced video clarity. Our method consistently improves the quality of generated videos through a straightforward yet effective strategy, substantiated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Underwood, Jon C. Calhoun, Sheng Di, Franck Cappello</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) techniques have become increasingly prevalent in high performance computing (HPC). However, these methods depend on vast volumes of floating point data for training and validation which need methods to share the data on a wide area network (WAN) or to transfer it from edge devices to data centers. Data compression can be a solution to these problems, but an in-depth understanding of how lossy compression affects model quality is needed. Prior work largely considers a single application or compression method. We designed a systematic methodology for evaluating data reduction techniques for ML/AI, and we use it to perform a very comprehensive evaluation with 17 data reduction methods on 7 ML/AI applications to show modern lossy compression methods can achieve a 50-100x compression ratio improvement for a 1% or less loss in quality. We identify critical insights that guide the future use and design of lossy compressors for ML/AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minzhou Pan, Zhengting Wang, Xin Dong, Vikash Sehwag, Lingjuan Lyu, Xue Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose WaterMark Detection (WMD), the first invisible watermark detection method under a black-box and annotation-free setting. WMD is capable of detecting arbitrary watermarks within a given reference dataset using a clean non-watermarked dataset as a reference, without relying on specific decoding methods or prior knowledge of the watermarking techniques. We develop WMD using foundations of offset learning, where a clean non-watermarked dataset enables us to isolate the influence of only watermarked samples in the reference dataset. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of WMD, significantly outperforming naive detection methods, which only yield AUC scores around 0.5. In contrast, WMD consistently achieves impressive detection AUC scores, surpassing 0.9 in most single-watermark datasets and exceeding 0.7 in more challenging multi-watermark scenarios across diverse datasets and watermarking methods. As invisible watermarks become increasingly prevalent, while specific decoding techniques remain undisclosed, our approach provides a versatile solution and establishes a path toward increasing accountability, transparency, and trust in our digital visual content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analytic features in gambling study are performed based on the amount of data monitoring on user daily actions. While performing the detection of problem gambling, existing datasets provide relatively rich analytic features for building machine learning based model. However, considering the complexity and cost of collecting the analytic features in real applications, conducting precise detection with less features will tremendously reduce the cost of data collection. In this study, we propose a deep neural networks PGN4 that performs well when using limited analytic features. Through the experiment on two datasets, we discover that PGN4 only experiences a mere performance drop when cutting 102 features to 5 features. Besides, we find the commonality within the top 5 features from two datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes CBGT-Net, a neural network model inspired by the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits found in mammalian brains. Unlike traditional neural network models, which either generate an output for each provided input, or an output after a fixed sequence of inputs, the CBGT-Net learns to produce an output after a sufficient criteria for evidence is achieved from a stream of observed data. For each observation, the CBGT-Net generates a vector that explicitly represents the amount of evidence the observation provides for each potential decision, accumulates the evidence over time, and generates a decision when the accumulated evidence exceeds a pre-defined threshold. We evaluate the proposed model on two image classification tasks, where models need to predict image categories based on a stream of small patches extracted from the image. We show that the CBGT-Net provides improved accuracy and robustness compared to models trained to classify from a single patch, and models leveraging an LSTM layer to classify from a fixed sequence length of patches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) based machine perception frameworks process the entire input in a one-shot manner to provide answers to both "what object is being observed" and "where it is located". In contrast, the "two-stream hypothesis" from neuroscience explains the neural processing in the human visual cortex as an active vision system that utilizes two separate regions of the brain to answer the what and the where questions. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework inspired by the "two-stream hypothesis" and explore the potential benefits that it offers. Specifically, the proposed framework models the following mechanisms: 1) ventral (what) stream focusing on the input regions perceived by the fovea part of an eye (foveation), 2) dorsal (where) stream providing visual guidance, and 3) iterative processing of the two streams to calibrate visual focus and process the sequence of focused image patches. The training of the proposed framework is accomplished by label-based DNN training for the ventral stream model and reinforcement learning for the dorsal stream model. We show that the two-stream foveation-based learning is applicable to the challenging task of weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where the training data is limited to the object class or its attributes. The framework is capable of both predicting the properties of an object and successfully localizing it by predicting its bounding box. We also show that, due to the independent nature of the two streams, the dorsal model can be applied on its own to unseen images to localize objects from different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an overview of scientific modeling and discusses the complementary strengths and weaknesses of ML methods for scientific modeling in comparison to process-based models. It also provides an introduction to the current state of research in the emerging field of scientific knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) that aims to use both scientific knowledge and data in ML frameworks to achieve better generalizability, scientific consistency, and explainability of results. We discuss different facets of KGML research in terms of the type of scientific knowledge used, the form of knowledge-ML integration explored, and the method for incorporating scientific knowledge in ML. We also discuss some of the common categories of use cases in environmental sciences where KGML methods are being developed, using illustrative examples in each category.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15994">Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Facial Expression Spotting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Deng, Hideaki Hayashi, Hajime Nagahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression spotting is a significant but challenging task in facial expression analysis. The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiben Liu, Huijie Fan, Qiang Wang, Xiai Chen, Zhi Han, Yandong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-Identification (LReID) aims to continuously learn from successive data streams, matching individuals across multiple cameras. The key challenge for LReID is how to effectively preserve old knowledge while learning new information incrementally. Task-level domain gaps and limited old task datasets are key factors leading to catastrophic forgetting in ReLD, which are overlooked in existing methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Diverse Representation Embedding (DRE) framework for LReID. The proposed DRE preserves old knowledge while adapting to new information based on instance-level and task-level layout. Concretely, an Adaptive Constraint Module (ACM) is proposed to implement integration and push away operations between multiple representations, obtaining dense embedding subspace for each instance to improve matching ability on limited old task datasets. Based on the processed diverse representation, we interact knowledge between the adjustment model and the learner model through Knowledge Update (KU) and Knowledge Preservation (KP) strategies at the task-level layout, which reduce the task-wise domain gap on both old and new tasks, and exploit diverse representation of each instance in limited datasets from old tasks, improving model performance for extended periods. Extensive experiments were conducted on eleven Re-ID datasets, including five seen datasets for training in order-1 and order-2 orders and six unseen datasets for inference. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves significantly improved performance in holistic, large-scale, and occluded datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Song, Jiacheng Yao, Zhengxi Li, Shaocong Xu, Shibo Jin, Jiajun Zhou, Chenbo Fu, Qi Xuan, Shanqing Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, federated learning has become widely used in various classical machine learning fields because of its collaborative ability to train data from multiple sources without compromising privacy. However, in the area of graph neural networks, the nodes and network structures of graphs held by clients are different in many practical applications, and the aggregation method that directly shares model gradients cannot be directly applied to this scenario. Therefore, this work proposes a federated aggregation method FLGNN applied to various graph federation scenarios and investigates the aggregation effect of parameter sharing at each layer of the graph neural network model. The effectiveness of the federated aggregation method FLGNN is verified by experiments on real datasets. Additionally, for the privacy security of FLGNN, this paper designs membership inference attack experiments and differential privacy defense experiments. The results show that FLGNN performs good robustness, and the success rate of privacy theft is further reduced by adding differential privacy defense methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyoel Gebre, Krishna Saxena, Timothy Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is the process of taking an image and generating lost or intentionally occluded portions. Inpainting has countless applications including restoring previously damaged pictures, restoring the quality of images that have been degraded due to compression, and removing unwanted objects/text. Modern inpainting techniques have shown remarkable ability in generating sensible completions for images with mask occlusions. In our paper, an overview of the progress of inpainting techniques will be provided, along with identifying current leading approaches, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses. A critical gap in these existing models will be addressed, focusing on the ability to prompt and control what exactly is generated. We will additionally justify why we think this is the natural next progressive step that inpainting models must take, and provide multiple approaches to implementing this functionality. Finally, we will evaluate the results of our approaches by qualitatively checking whether they generate high-quality images that correctly inpaint regions with the objects that they are instructed to produce.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16023">RPMArt: Towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated Objects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Wang, Wenhai Liu, Qiaojun Yu, Yang You, Liu Liu, Weiming Wang, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated objects are commonly found in daily life. It is essential that robots can exhibit robust perception and manipulation skills for articulated objects in real-world robotic applications. However, existing methods for articulated objects insufficiently address noise in point clouds and struggle to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, thus limiting the practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated Objects (RPMArt), which learns to estimate the articulation parameters and manipulate the articulation part from the noisy point cloud. Our primary contribution is a Robust Articulation Network (RoArtNet) that is able to predict both joint parameters and affordable points robustly by local feature learning and point tuple voting. Moreover, we introduce an articulation-aware classification scheme to enhance its ability for sim-to-real transfer. Finally, with the estimated affordable point and articulation joint constraint, the robot can generate robust actions to manipulate articulated objects. After learning only from synthetic data, RPMArt is able to transfer zero-shot to real-world articulated objects. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving state-of-the-art performance in both noise-added simulation and real-world environments. The code and data will be open-sourced for reproduction. More results are published on the project website at https://r-pmart.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibo Wang, Song Zhang, Ping Huang, Donghai Zhang, Wei Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research that combines implicit 3D representation with semantic information, like Semantic-NeRF, has proven that NeRF model could perform excellently in rendering 3D structures with semantic labels. This research aims to extend the Semantic Neural Radiance Fields (Semantic-NeRF) model by focusing solely on semantic output and removing the RGB output component. We reformulate the model and its training procedure to leverage only the cross-entropy loss between the model semantic output and the ground truth semantic images, removing the colour data traditionally used in the original Semantic-NeRF approach. We then conduct a series of identical experiments using the original and the modified Semantic-NeRF model. Our primary objective is to obverse the impact of this modification on the model performance by Semantic-NeRF, focusing on tasks such as scene understanding, object detection, and segmentation. The results offer valuable insights into the new way of rendering the scenes and provide an avenue for further research and development in semantic-focused 3D scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heyi Zhang, Xin Wang, Zhaopeng Meng, Yongzhe Jia, Dawei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in user intent understanding and response in a number of specialized domains, including medicine, law, and finance. However, in the unique domain of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the performance enhancement of LLMs is challenged by the essential differences between its theories and modern medicine, as well as the lack of specialized corpus resources. In this paper, we aim to construct and organize a professional corpus in the field of TCM, to endow the large model with professional knowledge that is characteristic of TCM theory, and to successfully develop the Qibo model based on LLaMA, which is the first LLM in the field of TCM to undergo a complete training process from pre-training to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Furthermore, we develop the Qibo-benchmark, a specialized tool for evaluating the performance of LLMs, which is a specialized tool for evaluating the performance of LLMs in the TCM domain. This tool will provide an important basis for quantifying and comparing the understanding and application capabilities of different models in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, and provide guidance for future research directions and practical applications of intelligent assistants for traditional Chinese medicine. Finally, we conducted sufficient experiments to prove that Qibo has good performance in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067">Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Zerui Tao, Jianhai Zhang, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16081">The Interplay of Learning, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence in Education</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutlu Cukurova</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a multi dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualization of AI as stochastic tools, as exemplified in generative AI, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the cognitive diversity inherent in AI algorithms, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research, which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualizations of AI in education: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human thought processes, and the extension of human cognition via tightly integrated human-AI systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition as exemplified in today's hype surrounding generative AI tools. The paper concludes with an advocacy for a broader educational approach that includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI enabled world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongrui Liu, Daqi Liu, Xueqian Li, Sihao Lin, Hongwei xie, Bing Wang, Xiaojun Chang, Lei Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Scene Flow Prior (NSFP) and Fast Neural Scene Flow (FNSF) have shown remarkable adaptability in the context of large out-of-distribution autonomous driving. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their astonishing generalization capabilities remain unclear. Our research addresses this gap by examining the generalization capabilities of NSFP through the lens of uniform stability, revealing that its performance is inversely proportional to the number of input point clouds. This finding sheds light on NSFP's effectiveness in handling large-scale point cloud scene flow estimation tasks. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we further explore the improvement of scene flow estimation by leveraging historical point clouds across multiple frames, which inherently increases the number of point clouds. Consequently, we propose a simple and effective method for multi-frame point cloud scene flow estimation, along with a theoretical evaluation of its generalization abilities. Our analysis confirms that the proposed method maintains a limited generalization error, suggesting that adding multiple frames to the scene flow optimization process does not detract from its generalizability. Extensive experimental results on large-scale autonomous driving Waymo Open and Argoverse lidar datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16130">AKBR: Learning Adaptive Kernel-based Representations for Graph Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feifei Qian, Lixin Cui, Yue Wang, Hangyuan Du, Lu Bai, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model to learn Adaptive Kernel-based Representations (AKBR) for graph classification. Unlike state-of-the-art R-convolution graph kernels that are defined by merely counting any pair of isomorphic substructures between graphs and cannot provide an end-to-end learning mechanism for the classifier, the proposed AKBR approach aims to define an end-to-end representation learning model to construct an adaptive kernel matrix for graphs. To this end, we commence by leveraging a novel feature-channel attention mechanism to capture the interdependencies between different substructure invariants of original graphs. The proposed AKBR model can thus effectively identify the structural importance of different substructures, and compute the R-convolution kernel between pairwise graphs associated with the more significant substructures specified by their structural attentions. Since each row of the resulting kernel matrix can be theoretically seen as the embedding vector of a sample graph, the proposed AKBR model is able to directly employ the resulting kernel matrix as the graph feature matrix and input it into the classifier for classification (i.e., the SoftMax layer), naturally providing an end-to-end learning architecture between the kernel computation as well as the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed AKBR model outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph kernels and deep learning methods on standard graph benchmarks.</p>

A theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world and synthetic data show that these methods inject strong statistical dependencies into the transformed datasets. After applying such a method, the representation space is highly structured: in the transformed space, an instance tends to be located near instances of the opposite label. As a consequence, the original labeling can in some cases be reconstructed by applying an anti-clustering method.</p>

<p>Abstract: For the past few years, the Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) has entered public lives. While CIoT has improved the convenience of people's daily lives, it has also brought new security and privacy concerns. In this survey, we try to figure out what researchers can learn about the security and privacy of CIoT by traffic analysis, a popular method in the security community. From the security and privacy perspective, this survey seeks out the new characteristics in CIoT traffic analysis, the state-of-the-art progress in CIoT traffic analysis, and the challenges yet to be solved. We collected 310 papers from January 2018 to December 2023 related to CIoT traffic analysis from the security and privacy perspective and summarized the process of CIoT traffic analysis in which the new characteristics of CIoT are identified. Then, we detail existing works based on five application goals: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic analysis, security analysis, and measurement.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16153">One Masked Model is All You Need for Sensor Fault Detection, Isolation and Accommodation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Fu, Weizhong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and reliable sensor measurements are critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of complex engineering systems such as wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (FDIA) using masked models and self-supervised learning. Our proposed approach is a general time series modeling approach that can be applied to any neural network (NN) model capable of sequence modeling, and captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among different sensors. During training, the proposed masked approach creates a random mask, which acts like a fault, for one or more sensors, making the training and inference task unified: finding the faulty sensors and correcting them. We validate our proposed technique on both a public dataset and a real-world dataset from GE offshore wind turbines, and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting, diagnosing and correcting sensor faults. The masked model not only simplifies the overall FDIA pipeline, but also outperforms existing approaches. Our proposed technique has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor measurements in complex engineering systems in real-time, and could be applied to other types of sensors and engineering systems in the future. We believe that our proposed framework can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective FDIA techniques for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oren Wright, Yorie Nakahira, Jos\'e M. F. Moura</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of neural networks is critical to measuring the reliability and robustness of deep learning systems. However, this often involves costly or inaccurate sampling methods and approximations. This paper presents a sample-free moment propagation technique that propagates mean vectors and covariance matrices across a network to accurately characterize the input-output distributions of neural networks. A key enabler of our technique is an analytic solution for the covariance of random variables passed through nonlinear activation functions, such as Heaviside, ReLU, and GELU. The wide applicability and merits of the proposed technique are shown in experiments analyzing the input-output distributions of trained neural networks and training Bayesian neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manisha Natarajan, Chunyue Xue, Sanne van Waveren, Karen Feigh, Matthew Gombolay</p>
<p>Abstract: For effective human-agent teaming, robots and other artificial intelligence (AI) agents must infer their human partner's abilities and behavioral response patterns and adapt accordingly. Most prior works make the unrealistic assumption that one or more teammates can act near-optimally. In real-world collaboration, humans and autonomous agents can be suboptimal, especially when each only has partial domain knowledge. In this work, we develop computational modeling and optimization techniques for enhancing the performance of suboptimal human-agent teams, where the human and the agent have asymmetric capabilities and act suboptimally due to incomplete environmental knowledge. We adopt an online Bayesian approach that enables a robot to infer people's willingness to comply with its assistance in a sequential decision-making game. Our user studies show that user preferences and team performance indeed vary with robot intervention styles, and our approach for mixed-initiative collaborations enhances objective team performance ($p<.001$) and subjective measures, such as user's trust ($p<.001$) and perceived likeability of the robot ($p<.001$).</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16209">Image Captioning in news report scenario</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianrui Liu, Qi Cai, Changxin Xu, Zhanxin Zhou, Jize Xiong, Yuxin Qiao, Tsungwei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning strives to generate pertinent captions for specified images, situating itself at the crossroads of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This endeavor is of paramount importance with far-reaching applications in recommendation systems, news outlets, social media, and beyond. Particularly within the realm of news reporting, captions are expected to encompass detailed information, such as the identities of celebrities captured in the images. However, much of the existing body of work primarily centers around understanding scenes and actions. In this paper, we explore the realm of image captioning specifically tailored for celebrity photographs, illustrating its broad potential for enhancing news industry practices. This exploration aims to augment automated news content generation, thereby facilitating a more nuanced dissemination of information. Our endeavor shows a broader horizon, enriching the narrative in news reporting through a more intuitive image captioning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yan, Yang Li, Zhennan Wu, Shenzhou Chen, Weixuan Sun, Taizhang Shang, Weizhe Liu, Tian Chen, Xiaqiang Dai, Chao Ma, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Frankenstein, a diffusion-based framework that can generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes in a single pass. Unlike existing methods that output a single, unified 3D shape, Frankenstein simultaneously generates multiple separated shapes, each corresponding to a semantically meaningful part. The 3D scene information is encoded in one single tri-plane tensor, from which multiple Singed Distance Function (SDF) fields can be decoded to represent the compositional shapes. During training, an auto-encoder compresses tri-planes into a latent space, and then the denoising diffusion process is employed to approximate the distribution of the compositional scenes. Frankenstein demonstrates promising results in generating room interiors as well as human avatars with automatically separated parts. The generated scenes facilitate many downstream applications, such as part-wise re-texturing, object rearrangement in the room or avatar cloth re-targeting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Altmayer Pizzorno, Emery D. Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents CoverUp, a novel system that drives the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests via a combination of coverage analysis and large-language models (LLMs). CoverUp iteratively improves coverage, interleaving coverage analysis with dialogs with the LLM to focus its attention on as yet uncovered lines and branches. The resulting test suites significantly improve coverage over the current state of the art: compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid LLM / search-based software testing system, CoverUp substantially improves coverage across the board. On a per-module basis, CoverUp achieves median line coverage of 81% (vs. 62%), branch coverage of 53% (vs. 35%) and line+branch coverage of 78% (vs. 55%). We show that CoverUp's iterative, coverage-guided approach is crucial to its effectiveness, contributing to nearly half of its successes.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16230">On machine learning analysis of atomic force microscopy images for image classification, sample surface recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Sokolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM or SPM) imaging is one of the best matches with machine learning (ML) analysis among microscopy techniques. The digital format of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used in image recognition. This Prospective is focused on ML recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images, small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding statistical significance is also described.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16260">Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Xu, Fuxun Yu, Zirui Xu, Nathan Inkawhich, Xiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training strategies based on self-supervised learning (SSL) have proven to be effective pretext tasks for many downstream tasks in computer vision. Due to the significant disparity between medical and natural images, the application of typical SSL is not straightforward in medical imaging. Additionally, those pretext tasks often lack context, which is critical for computer-aided clinical decision support. In this paper, we developed a longitudinal masked auto-encoder (MAE) based on the well-known Transformer-based MAE. In particular, we explored the importance of time-aware position embedding as well as disease progression-aware masking. Taking into account the time between examinations instead of just scheduling them offers the benefit of capturing temporal changes and trends. The masking strategy, for its part, evolves during follow-up to better capture pathological changes, ensuring a more accurate assessment of disease progression. Using OPHDIAT, a large follow-up screening dataset targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR), we evaluated the pre-trained weights on a longitudinal task, which is to predict the severity label of the next visit within 3 years based on the past time series examinations. Our results demonstrated the relevancy of both time-aware position embedding and masking strategies based on disease progression knowledge. Compared to popular baseline models and standard longitudinal Transformers, these simple yet effective extensions significantly enhance the predictive ability of deep classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Tang, Daiki Shimada, Jing Bi, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In everyday communication, humans frequently use speech and gestures to refer to specific areas or objects, a process known as Referential Dialogue (RD). While prior studies have investigated RD through Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in static contexts, the exploration of Temporal Referential Dialogue (TRD) within audio-visual media remains limited. Two primary challenges hinder progress in this field: (1) the absence of comprehensive, untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations, and (2) the need for methods to integrate complex temporal auditory and visual cues effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework to generate PU-VALOR, an extensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 untrimmed videos with accurate temporal demarcations. We also present AVicuna, featuring an Audio-Visual Tokens Interleaver (AVTI) that ensures the temporal alignment of audio-visual information. Additionally, we develop the A5-222K dataset, encompassing more than 200,000 audio-text pairings, to facilitate the audio and text alignments. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna can effectively handle TRD in audio-visual videos and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various audio-visual video understanding tasks, particularly in untrimmed videos. We further investigate the optimal audio-interleaving rate for interleaved audio-visual inputs, which maximizes performance on the Audio-Visual Event Dense Localization task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> No\'e Zapata, Gerardo P\'erez, Lucas Bonilla, Pedro N\'u\~nez, Pilar Bachiller, Pablo Bustos</p>
<p>Abstract: For robots to interact socially, they must interpret human intentions and anticipate their potential outcomes accurately. This is particularly important for social robots designed for human care, which may face potentially dangerous situations for people, such as unseen obstacles in their way, that should be avoided. This paper explores the Artificial Theory of Mind (ATM) approach to inferring and interpreting human intentions. We propose an algorithm that detects risky situations for humans, selecting a robot action that removes the danger in real time. We use the simulation-based approach to ATM and adopt the 'like-me' policy to assign intentions and actions to people. Using this strategy, the robot can detect and act with a high rate of success under time-constrained situations. The algorithm has been implemented as part of an existing robotics cognitive architecture and tested in simulation scenarios. Three experiments have been conducted to test the implementation's robustness, precision and real-time response, including a simulated scenario, a human-in-the-loop hybrid configuration and a real-world scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This comprehensive review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most widely employed forms of bio-inspired computation. However the current trend is for ANNs to be structurally homogeneous. Furthermore, this structural homogeneity requires the application of complex training and learning tools that produce application specific ANNs, susceptible to pitfalls such as overfitting. In this paper, an new approach is explored, inspired by the role played in biology by Neural Microcircuits, the so called ``fundamental processing elements'' of organic nervous systems. How large neural networks, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can be assembled using Artificial Neural Microcircuits (ANMs), intended as off-the-shelf components, is articulated; the results of initial work to produce a catalogue of such Microcircuits though the use of Novelty Search is shown; followed by efforts to expand upon this initial work, including a discussion of challenges uncovered during these efforts and explorations of methods by which they might be overcome.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16334">Graphs Generalization under Distribution Shifts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Tian, Wenjun Wang, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao, Wang Zhang, Dong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional machine learning methods heavily rely on the independent and identically distribution assumption, which imposes limitations when the test distribution deviates from the training distribution. To address this crucial issue, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, which aims to achieve satisfactory generalization performance when faced with unknown distribution shifts, has made a significant process. However, the OOD method for graph-structured data currently lacks clarity and remains relatively unexplored due to two primary challenges. Firstly, distribution shifts on graphs often occur simultaneously on node attributes and graph topology. Secondly, capturing invariant information amidst diverse distribution shifts proves to be a formidable challenge. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, namely Graph Learning Invariant Domain genERation (GLIDER). The goal is to (1) diversify variations across domains by modeling the potential seen or unseen variations of attribute distribution and topological structure and (2) minimize the discrepancy of the variation in a representation space where the target is to predict semantic labels. Extensive experiment results indicate that our model outperforms baseline methods on node-level OOD generalization across domains in distribution shift on node features and topological structures simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhumitha Sakthi, Louis Kerofsky, Varun Ravi Kumar, Senthil Yogamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems require extensive data collection schemes to cover the diverse scenarios needed for building a robust and safe system. The data volumes are in the order of Exabytes and have to be stored for a long period of time (i.e., more than 10 years of the vehicle's life cycle). Lossless compression doesn't provide sufficient compression ratios, hence, lossy video compression has been explored. It is essential to prove that lossy video compression artifacts do not impact the performance of the perception algorithms. However, there is limited work in this area to provide a solid conclusion. In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which have high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts. Fisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection task. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard video compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that the achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and temporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware zonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In addition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of the latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs for the application to fisheye imagery.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16345">Enhanced Facet Generation with LLM Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joosung Lee, Jinhong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In information retrieval, facet identification of a user query is an important task. If a search service can recognize the facets of a user's query, it has the potential to offer users a much broader range of search results. Previous studies can enhance facet prediction by leveraging retrieved documents and related queries obtained through a search engine. However, there are challenges in extending it to other applications when a search engine operates as part of the model. First, search engines are constantly updated. Therefore, additional information may change during training and test, which may reduce performance. The second challenge is that public search engines cannot search for internal documents. Therefore, a separate search system needs to be built to incorporate documents from private domains within the company. We propose two strategies that focus on a framework that can predict facets by taking only queries as input without a search engine. The first strategy is multi-task learning to predict SERP. By leveraging SERP as a target instead of a source, the proposed model deeply understands queries without relying on external modules. The second strategy is to enhance the facets by combining Large Language Model (LLM) and the small model. Overall performance improves when small model and LLM are combined rather than facet generation individually.</p>

<p>Abstract: We conducted a survey of 135 software engineering (SE) practitioners to understand how they use Generative AI-based chatbots like ChatGPT for SE tasks. We find that they want to use ChatGPT for SE tasks like software library selection but often worry about the truthfulness of ChatGPT responses. We developed a suite of techniques and a tool called CID (ChatGPT Incorrectness Detector) to automatically test and detect the incorrectness in ChatGPT responses. CID is based on the iterative prompting to ChatGPT by asking it contextually similar but textually divergent questions (using an approach that utilizes metamorphic relationships in texts). The underlying principle in CID is that for a given question, a response that is different from other responses (across multiple incarnations of the question) is likely an incorrect response. In a benchmark study of library selection, we show that CID can detect incorrect responses from ChatGPT with an F1-score of 0.74 - 0.75.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyla Levin, Nicolas van Kempen, Emery D. Berger, Stephen N. Freund</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ChatDBG, the first AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to take the wheel and drive debugging by issuing commands to navigate through stacks and inspect program state; it then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB, GDB, and WinDBG for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded nearly 30,000 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Rudolph, Caleb Chuck, Kevin Black, Misha Lvovsky, Scott Niekum, Amy Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning agents using high-dimensional observations must be able to identify relevant state features amidst many exogeneous distractors. A representation that captures controllability identifies these state elements by determining what affects agent control. While methods such as inverse dynamics and mutual information capture controllability for a limited number of timesteps, capturing long-horizon elements remains a challenging problem. Myopic controllability can capture the moment right before an agent crashes into a wall, but not the control-relevance of the wall while the agent is still some distance away. To address this we introduce action-bisimulation encoding, a method inspired by the bisimulation invariance pseudometric, that extends single-step controllability with a recursive invariance constraint. By doing this, action-bisimulation learns a multi-step controllability metric that smoothly discounts distant state features that are relevant for control. We demonstrate that action-bisimulation pretraining on reward-free, uniformly random data improves sample efficiency in several environments, including a photorealistic 3D simulation domain, Habitat. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and qualitative results demonstrating the information captured by action-bisimulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Chen, Luyang Luo, Yequan Bie, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still been faced with several challenges. First, the inherent imbalance in the distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm the critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently, LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts. Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with perceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated during training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for different diseases. Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. The code will be made publically available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingshan Chang, Yasi Zhang, Zhiyuan Fang, Yingnian Wu, Yonatan Bisk, Feng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The literature on text-to-image generation is plagued by issues of faithfully composing entities with relations. But there lacks a formal understanding of how entity-relation compositions can be effectively learned. Moreover, the underlying phenomenon space that meaningfully reflects the problem structure is not well-defined, leading to an arms race for larger quantities of data in the hope that generalization emerges out of large-scale pretraining. We hypothesize that the underlying phenomenological coverage has not been proportionally scaled up, leading to a skew of the presented phenomenon which harms generalization. We introduce statistical metrics that quantify both the linguistic and visual skew of a dataset for relational learning, and show that generalization failures of text-to-image generation are a direct result of incomplete or unbalanced phenomenological coverage. We first perform experiments in a synthetic domain and demonstrate that systematically controlled metrics are strongly predictive of generalization performance. Then we move to natural images and show that simple distribution perturbations in light of our theories boost generalization without enlarging the absolute data size. This work informs an important direction towards quality-enhancing the data diversity or balance orthogonal to scaling up the absolute size. Our discussions point out important open questions on 1) Evaluation of generated entity-relation compositions, and 2) Better models for reasoning with abstract relations.</p>

However, traditional machine-learning-based MB-RMR methods, which rely heavily on simulated data or complete structured ground truth, face significant deployment challenges. These challenges stem from the differences between simulated and actual data, as well as the scarcity of real-world measurements. To address these challenges, our study presents RadioGAT, a novel framework based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) tailored for MB-RMR within a single area, eliminating the need for multi-region datasets. RadioGAT innovatively merges model-based spatial-spectral correlation encoding with data-driven radiomap generalization, thus minimizing the reliance on extensive data sources. The framework begins by transforming sparse multi-band data into a graph structure through an innovative encoding strategy that leverages radio propagation models to capture the spatial-spectral correlation inherent in the data. This graph-based representation not only simplifies data handling but also enables tailored label sampling during training, significantly enhancing the framework's adaptability for deployment. Subsequently, The GAT is employed to generalize the radiomap information across various frequency bands. Extensive experiments using raytracing datasets based on real-world environments have demonstrated RadioGAT's enhanced accuracy in supervised learning settings and its robustness in semi-supervised scenarios. These results underscore RadioGAT's effectiveness and practicality for MB-RMR in environments with limited data availability.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16398">Rethinking the Representation in Federated Unsupervised Learning with Non-IID Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinting Liao, Weiming Liu, Chaochao Chen, Pengyang Zhou, Fengyuan Yu, Huabin Zhu, Binhui Yao, Tao Wang, Xiaolin Zheng, Yanchao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning achieves effective performance in modeling decentralized data. In practice, client data are not well-labeled, which makes it potential for federated unsupervised learning (FUSL) with non-IID data. However, the performance of existing FUSL methods suffers from insufficient representations, i.e., (1) representation collapse entanglement among local and global models, and (2) inconsistent representation spaces among local models. The former indicates that representation collapse in local model will subsequently impact the global model and other local models. The latter means that clients model data representation with inconsistent parameters due to the deficiency of supervision signals. In this work, we propose FedU2 which enhances generating uniform and unified representation in FUSL with non-IID data. Specifically, FedU2 consists of flexible uniform regularizer (FUR) and efficient unified aggregator (EUA). FUR in each client avoids representation collapse via dispersing samples uniformly, and EUA in server promotes unified representation by constraining consistent client model updating. To extensively validate the performance of FedU2, we conduct both cross-device and cross-silo evaluation experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16418">An incremental MaxSAT-based model to learn balanced rules</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ant\^onio Carlos Souza Ferreira J\'unior, Thiago Alves Rocha</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing advancements in the field of machine learning have led to the development of numerous applications that effectively address a wide range of problems with accurate predictions. However, in certain cases, accuracy alone may not be sufficient. Many real-world problems also demand explanations and interpretability behind the predictions. One of the most popular interpretable models that are classification rules. This work aims to propose an incremental model for learning interpretable and balanced rules based on MaxSAT, called IMLIB. This new model was based on two other approaches, one based on SAT and the other on MaxSAT. The one based on SAT limits the size of each generated rule, making it possible to balance them. We suggest that such a set of rules seem more natural to be understood compared to a mixture of large and small rules. The approach based on MaxSAT, called IMLI, presents a technique to increase performance that involves learning a set of rules by incrementally applying the model in a dataset. Finally, IMLIB and IMLI are compared using diverse databases. IMLIB obtained results comparable to IMLI in terms of accuracy, generating more balanced rules with smaller sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanyam Lakhanpal, Shivang Chopra, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Man Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation approaches based on diffusion models have gained significant attention. However, vanilla diffusion models often suffer from spelling inaccuracies in the text displayed within the generated images. The capability to generate visual text is crucial, offering both academic interest and a wide range of practical applications. To produce accurate visual text images, state-of-the-art techniques adopt a glyph-controlled image generation approach, consisting of a text layout generator followed by an image generator that is conditioned on the generated text layout. Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three primary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future research. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for testing models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual text. Subsequently, we introduce a training-free framework to enhance the two-stage generation approaches. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on both LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval benchmarks and demonstrate notable improvements across a range of evaluation metrics, including CLIPScore, OCR precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and edit distance scores. For instance, our proposed framework improves the backbone model, TextDiffuser, by more than 23\% and 13.5\% in terms of OCR word F1 on LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval, respectively. Our work makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing on generating images with long and rare text sequences, a niche previously unexplored by existing literature</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Yu, Hao Wang, Weiming Li, Qiang Wang, Soonyong Cho, Younghun Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: Point scene understanding is a challenging task to process real-world scene point cloud, which aims at segmenting each object, estimating its pose, and reconstructing its mesh simultaneously. Recent state-of-the-art method first segments each object and then processes them independently with multiple stages for the different sub-tasks. This leads to a complex pipeline to optimize and makes it hard to leverage the relationship constraints between multiple objects. In this work, we propose a novel Disentangled Object-Centric TRansformer (DOCTR) that explores object-centric representation to facilitate learning with multiple objects for the multiple sub-tasks in a unified manner. Each object is represented as a query, and a Transformer decoder is adapted to iteratively optimize all the queries involving their relationship. In particular, we introduce a semantic-geometry disentangled query (SGDQ) design that enables the query features to attend separately to semantic information and geometric information relevant to the corresponding sub-tasks. A hybrid bipartite matching module is employed to well use the supervisions from all the sub-tasks during training. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging ScanNet dataset.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16432">$\textit{LinkPrompt}$: Natural and Universal Adversarial Attacks on Prompt-based Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Xu, Wenjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by \textit{LinkPrompt} to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.</p>

<p>Abstract: The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on code-related tasks has shown the potential of fully automated software development. In light of this, we introduce a new software engineering task, namely Natural Language to code Repository (NL2Repo). This task aims to generate an entire code repository from its natural language requirements. To address this task, we propose a simple yet effective framework CodeS, which decomposes NL2Repo into multiple sub-tasks by a multi-layer sketch. Specifically, CodeS includes three modules: RepoSketcher, FileSketcher, and SketchFiller. RepoSketcher first generates a repository's directory structure for given requirements; FileSketcher then generates a file sketch for each file in the generated structure; SketchFiller finally fills in the details for each function in the generated file sketch. To rigorously assess CodeS on the NL2Repo task, we carry out evaluations through both automated benchmarking and manual feedback analysis. For benchmark-based evaluation, we craft a repository-oriented benchmark, SketchEval, and design an evaluation metric, SketchBLEU. For feedback-based evaluation, we develop a VSCode plugin for CodeS and engage 30 participants in conducting empirical studies. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness and practicality of CodeS on the NL2Repo task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zhang, Haoyu Chen, Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Jin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustered federated learning (CFL) is proposed to mitigate the performance deterioration stemming from data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) by grouping similar clients for cluster-wise model training. However, current CFL methods struggle due to inadequate integration of global and intra-cluster knowledge and the absence of an efficient online model similarity metric, while treating the cluster count as a fixed hyperparameter limits flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive CFL framework, named FedAC, which (1) efficiently integrates global knowledge into intra-cluster learning by decoupling neural networks and utilizing distinct aggregation methods for each submodule, significantly enhancing performance; (2) includes a costeffective online model similarity metric based on dimensionality reduction; (3) incorporates a cluster number fine-tuning module for improved adaptability and scalability in complex, heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments show that FedAC achieves superior empirical performance, increasing the test accuracy by around 1.82% and 12.67% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively, under different non-IID settings compared to SOTA methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16495">LSTTN: A Long-Short Term Transformer-based Spatio-temporal Neural Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyao Luo, Silu He, Xing Han, Yuhan Wang, Haifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a fundamental problem in intelligent transportation systems and learning long-range traffic representations with key information through spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) is a basic assumption of current traffic flow prediction models. However, due to structural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic flow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and periodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the key temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a compact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN (Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively considering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow. First, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked subseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context in a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and contextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series. Then, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by using stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are extracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making time-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn fine-grained short-term temporal features. Finally, LSTTN fuses the long-term trend, periodic features and short-term features to obtain the prediction results. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that in 60-minute-ahead long-term forecasting, the LSTTN model achieves a minimum improvement of 5.63\% and a maximum improvement of 16.78\% over baseline models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Cahyawijaya, Holy Lovenia, Pascale Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to perform diverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context information, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. Nonetheless, there is only a handful of works explored ICL for low-resource languages with most of them focusing on relatively high-resource languages, such as French and Spanish. In this work, we extensively study ICL and its cross-lingual variation (X-ICL) on 25 low-resource and 7 relatively higher-resource languages. Our study not only assesses the effectiveness of ICL with LLMs in low-resource languages but also identifies the shortcomings of in-context label alignment, and introduces a more effective alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we provide valuable insights into various facets of ICL for low-resource languages. Our study concludes the significance of few-shot in-context information on enhancing the low-resource understanding quality of LLMs through semantically relevant information by closing the language gap in the target language and aligning the semantics between the targeted low-resource and the high-resource language that the model is proficient in. Our work highlights the importance of advancing ICL research, particularly for low-resource languages.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16523">Causal Discovery from Poisson Branching Structural Causal Model Using High-Order Cumulant with Path Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Qiao, Yu Xiang, Zhengming Chen, Ruichu Cai, Zhifeng Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Count data naturally arise in many fields, such as finance, neuroscience, and epidemiology, and discovering causal structure among count data is a crucial task in various scientific and industrial scenarios. One of the most common characteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by a binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that captures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count scenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival follows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson distribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to the non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e., $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately, in this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is identifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to $Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed path to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching Structure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using high-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the path and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained from the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable under some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal structure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhao Hu, Shaochong Jia, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used for conditional data cross-modal generation tasks such as text-to-image and text-to-video. However, state-of-the-art models still fail to align the generated visual concepts with high-level semantics in a language such as object count, spatial relationship, etc. We approach this problem from a multimodal data fusion perspective and investigate how different fusion strategies can affect vision-language alignment. We discover that compared to the widely used early fusion of conditioning text in a pretrained image feature space, a specially designed intermediate fusion can: (i) boost text-to-image alignment with improved generation quality and (ii) improve training and inference efficiency by reducing low-rank text-to-image attention calculations. We perform experiments using a text-to-image generation task on the MS-COCO dataset. We compare our intermediate fusion mechanism with the classic early fusion mechanism on two common conditioning methods on a U-shaped ViT backbone. Our intermediate fusion model achieves a higher CLIP Score and lower FID, with 20% reduced FLOPs, and 50% increased training speed compared to a strong U-ViT baseline with an early fusion.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16543">Efficient Information Extraction in Few-Shot Relation Classification through Contrastive Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Borchert, Jochen De Weerdt, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiating relationships between entity pairs with limited labeled instances poses a significant challenge in few-shot relation classification. Representations of textual data extract rich information spanning the domain, entities, and relations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to enhance information extraction combining multiple sentence representations and contrastive learning. While representations in relation classification are commonly extracted using entity marker tokens, we argue that substantial information within the internal model representations remains untapped. To address this, we propose aligning multiple sentence representations, such as the [CLS] token, the [MASK] token used in prompting, and entity marker tokens. Our method employs contrastive learning to extract complementary discriminative information from these individual representations. This is particularly relevant in low-resource settings where information is scarce. Leveraging multiple sentence representations is especially effective in distilling discriminative information for relation classification when additional information, like relation descriptions, are not available. We validate the adaptability of our approach, maintaining robust performance in scenarios that include relation descriptions, and showcasing its flexibility to adapt to different resource constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

<p>Abstract: The black-box nature of deep learning models in NLP hinders their widespread application. The research focus has shifted to Hierarchical Attribution (HA) for its ability to model feature interactions. Recent works model non-contiguous combinations with a time-costly greedy search in Eculidean spaces, neglecting underlying linguistic information in feature representations. In this work, we introduce a novel method, namely Poincar\'e Explanation (PE), for modeling feature interactions using hyperbolic spaces in an $O(n^2logn)$ time complexity. Inspired by Poincar\'e model, we propose a framework to project the embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, which exhibit better inductive biases for syntax and semantic hierarchical structures. Eventually, we prove that the hierarchical clustering process in the projected space could be viewed as building a minimum spanning tree and propose a time efficient algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Ji, Zhaowei Zhu, Wei Xi, Olga Gadyatskaya, Zilong Song, Yong Cai, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) heavily depends on label quality for its performance. However, the label distribution among individual clients is always both noisy and heterogeneous. The high loss incurred by client-specific samples in heterogeneous label noise poses challenges for distinguishing between client-specific and noisy label samples, impacting the effectiveness of existing label noise learning approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose FedFixer, where the personalized model is introduced to cooperate with the global model to effectively select clean client-specific samples. In the dual models, updating the personalized model solely at a local level can lead to overfitting on noisy data due to limited samples, consequently affecting both the local and global models' performance. To mitigate overfitting, we address this concern from two perspectives. Firstly, we employ a confidence regularizer to alleviate the impact of unconfident predictions caused by label noise. Secondly, a distance regularizer is implemented to constrain the disparity between the personalized and global models. We validate the effectiveness of FedFixer through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that FedFixer can perform well in filtering noisy label samples on different clients, especially in highly heterogeneous label noise scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation models adapting to new tasks in a training-free manner through in-context learning is an exciting advancement. Universal segmentation models aim to generalize across the diverse modality of medical images, yet their effectiveness often diminishes when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) data modalities and tasks, requiring intricate fine-tuning of model for optimal performance. For addressing this challenge, we introduce SegICL, a novel approach leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) for image segmentation. Unlike existing methods, SegICL has the capability to employ text-guided segmentation and conduct in-context learning with a small set of image-mask pairs, eliminating the need for training the model from scratch or fine-tuning for OOD tasks (including OOD modality and dataset). Extensive experimental validation of SegICL demonstrates a positive correlation between the number of prompt samples and segmentation performance on OOD modalities and tasks. This indicates that SegICL effectively address new segmentation tasks based on contextual information. Additionally, SegICL also exhibits comparable segmentation performance to mainstream models on OOD and in-distribution tasks. Our code will be released soon.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16582">In the Search for Optimal Multi-view Learning Models for Crop Classification with Global Remote Sensing Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination, including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or related tasks through a MVL approach.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16591">Deciphering the Interplay between Local Differential Privacy, Average Bayesian Privacy, and Maximum Bayesian Privacy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojin Zhang, Yulin Fei, Wei Chen, Hai Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The swift evolution of machine learning has led to emergence of various definitions of privacy due to the threats it poses to privacy, including the concept of local differential privacy (LDP). Although widely embraced and utilized across numerous domains, this conventional approach to measure privacy still exhibits certain limitations, spanning from failure to prevent inferential disclosure to lack of consideration for the adversary's background knowledge. In this comprehensive study, we introduce Bayesian privacy and delve into the intricate relationship between local differential privacy and its Bayesian counterparts, unveiling novel insights into utility-privacy trade-offs. We introduce a framework that encapsulates both attack and defense strategies, highlighting their interplay and effectiveness. Our theoretical contributions are anchored in the rigorous definitions and relationships between Average Bayesian Privacy (ABP) and Maximum Bayesian Privacy (MBP), encapsulated by equations $\epsilon_{p,a} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{(\epsilon_{p,m} + \epsilon)\cdot(e^{\epsilon_{p,m} + \epsilon} - 1)}$ and the equivalence between $\xi$-MBP and $2\xi$-LDP established under uniform prior distribution. These relationships fortify our understanding of the privacy guarantees provided by various mechanisms, leading to the realization that a mechanism satisfying $\xi$-LDP also confers $\xi$-MBP, and vice versa. Our work not only lays the groundwork for future empirical exploration but also promises to enhance the design of privacy-preserving algorithms that do not compromise on utility, thereby fostering the development of trustworthy machine learning solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a probability riddle with no definite solution for more than two decades and its solution is of great interest in many fields of knowledge. There are two main competing solutions to the problem: the halfer approach, and the thirder approach. The main reason for disagreement in the literature is connected to the use of different probability spaces to represent the same probabilistic riddle. In this work, we analyse the problem from a mathematical perspective, identifying probability distributions induced directly from the thought experiment's rules. The precise choices of probability spaces provide both halfer and thirder solutions to the problem. To try and decide on which approach to follow, a criterion involving the information available to Sleeping Beauty is proposed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huifeng Yin, Hanle Zheng, Jiayi Mao, Siyuan Ding, Xing Liu, Mingkun Xu, Yifan Hu, Jing Pei, Lei Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the neural circuits of the brain, are promising in achieving high computational efficiency with biological fidelity. Nevertheless, it is quite difficult to optimize SNNs because the functional roles of their modelling components remain unclear. By designing and evaluating several variants of the classic model, we systematically investigate the functional roles of key modelling components, leakage, reset, and recurrence, in leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) based SNNs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how these components influence the accuracy, generalization, and robustness of SNNs. Specifically, we find that the leakage plays a crucial role in balancing memory retention and robustness, the reset mechanism is essential for uninterrupted temporal processing and computational efficiency, and the recurrence enriches the capability to model complex dynamics at a cost of robustness degradation. With these interesting observations, we provide optimization suggestions for enhancing the performance of SNNs in different scenarios. This work deepens the understanding of how SNNs work, which offers valuable guidance for the development of more effective and robust neuromorphic models.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687">Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayue Zhang, Yiheng Liu, Wenqi Cai, Yali Peng, Senqing Qi, Taotao Long, Bao Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16707">One-Shot Domain Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasushi Esaki, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) has been discussed in previous studies on deep neural network models for classification. In DIL, we assume that samples on new domains are observed over time. The models must classify inputs on all domains. In practice, however, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform DIL under the constraint that the samples on the new domain are observed only infrequently. Therefore, in this study, we consider the extreme case where we have only one sample from the new domain, which we call one-shot DIL. We first empirically show that existing DIL methods do not work well in one-shot DIL. We have analyzed the reason for this failure through various investigations. According to our analysis, we clarify that the difficulty of one-shot DIL is caused by the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Therefore, we propose a technique regarding these statistics and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through experiments on open datasets.</p>

To formalise this intuition, the paper proposes an action framework based on the STRIPS formalisation. Technically, the contribution expresses actions in terms of Value-based Formal Reasoning (VFR), which provides a set of propositions derived from an Agent's value profile and the Agent's assessment of propositions with respect to the profile. Conceptually, the contribution provides a computational framework for a form of consequentialist ethics which is satisficing, luralistic, act-based, and preferential.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16757">Bi-objective Optimization in Role Mining</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Crampton, Eduard Eiben, Gregory Gutin, Daniel Karapetyan, Diptapriyo Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Role mining is a technique used to derive a role-based authorization policy from an existing policy. Given a set of users $U$, a set of permissions $P$ and a user-permission authorization relation $\mahtit{UPA}\subseteq U\times P$, a role mining algorithm seeks to compute a set of roles $R$, a user-role authorization relation $\mathit{UA}\subseteq U\times R$ and a permission-role authorization relation $\mathit{PA}\subseteq R\times P$, such that the composition of $\mathit{UA}$ and $\mathit{PA}$ is close (in some appropriate sense) to $\mathit{UPA}$.
  In this paper, we first introduce the Generalized Noise Role Mining problem (GNRM) -- a generalization of the MinNoise Role Mining problem -- which we believe has considerable practical relevance. Extending work of Fomin et al., we show that GNRM is fixed parameter tractable, with parameter $r + k$, where $r$ is the number of roles in the solution and $k$ is the number of discrepancies between $\mathit{UPA}$ and the relation defined by the composition of $\mathit{UA}$ and $\mathit{PA}$. We further introduce a bi-objective optimization variant of GNRM, where we wish to minimize both $r$ and $k$ subject to upper bounds $r\le \bar{r}$ and $k\le \bar{k}$, where $\bar{r}$ and $\bar{k}$ are constants. We show that the Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem (BO-GNRM) can be computed in fixed-parameter tractable time with parameter $\bar{r}+\bar{k}$.
  We then report the results of our experimental work using the integer programming solver Gurobi to solve instances of BO-GNRM. Our key findings are that (a) we obtained strong support that Gurobi's performance is fixed-parameter tractable, (b) our results suggest that our techniques may be useful for role mining in practice, based on our experiments in the context of three well-known real-world authorization policies.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760">As Good As A Coin Toss Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Cooke, Abigail Edwards, Sophia Barkoff, Kathryn Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an effective counterdefense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sondess Missaoui, Simos Gerasimou, Nikolaos Matragkas</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their unprecedented success, DNNs are notoriously fragile to small shifts in data distribution, demanding effective testing techniques that can assess their dependability. Despite recent advances in DNN testing, there is a lack of systematic testing approaches that assess the DNN's capability to generalise and operate comparably beyond data in their training distribution. We address this gap with DeepKnowledge, a systematic testing methodology for DNN-based systems founded on the theory of knowledge generalisation, which aims to enhance DNN robustness and reduce the residual risk of 'black box' models. Conforming to this theory, DeepKnowledge posits that core computational DNN units, termed Transfer Knowledge neurons, can generalise under domain shift. DeepKnowledge provides an objective confidence measurement on testing activities of DNN given data distribution shifts and uses this information to instrument a generalisation-informed test adequacy criterion to check the transfer knowledge capacity of a test set. Our empirical evaluation of several DNNs, across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of DeepKnowledge and its ability to support the engineering of more dependable DNNs. We report improvements of up to 10 percentage points over state-of-the-art coverage criteria for detecting adversarial attacks on several benchmarks, including MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16782">The Anatomy of Adversarial Attacks: Concept-based XAI Dissection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Mikriukov, Gesina Schwalbe, Franz Motzkus, Korinna Bade</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks (AAs) pose a significant threat to the reliability and robustness of deep neural networks. While the impact of these attacks on model predictions has been extensively studied, their effect on the learned representations and concepts within these models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of AAs on the concepts learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Through an extensive set of experiments across various network architectures and targeted AA techniques, we unveil several key findings. First, AAs induce substantial alterations in the concept composition within the feature space, introducing new concepts or modifying existing ones. Second, the adversarial perturbation itself can be linearly decomposed into a set of latent vector components, with a subset of these being responsible for the attack's success. Notably, we discover that these components are target-specific, i.e., are similar for a given target class throughout different AA techniques and starting classes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the nature of AAs and their impact on learned representations, paving the way for the development of more robust and interpretable deep learning models, as well as effective defenses against adversarial threats.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16798">Cluster-Based Normalization Layer for Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning faces significant challenges during the training of neural networks, including internal covariate shift, label shift, vanishing/exploding gradients, overfitting, and computational complexity. While conventional normalization methods, such as Batch Normalization, aim to tackle some of these issues, they often depend on assumptions that constrain their adaptability. Mixture Normalization faces computational hurdles in its pursuit of handling multiple Gaussian distributions.
  This paper introduces Cluster-Based Normalization (CB-Norm) in two variants - Supervised Cluster-Based Normalization (SCB-Norm) and Unsupervised Cluster-Based Normalization (UCB-Norm) - proposing a groundbreaking one-step normalization approach. CB-Norm leverages a Gaussian mixture model to specifically address challenges related to gradient stability and learning acceleration.
  For SCB-Norm, a supervised variant, the novel mechanism involves introducing predefined data partitioning, termed clusters, to normalize activations based on the assigned cluster. This cluster-driven approach creates a space that conforms to a Gaussian mixture model. On the other hand, UCB-Norm, an unsupervised counterpart, dynamically clusters neuron activations during training, adapting to task-specific challenges without relying on predefined data partitions (clusters). This dual approach ensures flexibility in addressing diverse learning scenarios.
  CB-Norm innovatively uses a one-step normalization approach, where parameters of each mixture component (cluster in activation space) serve as weights for deep neural networks. This adaptive clustering process tackles both clustering and resolution of deep neural network tasks concurrently during training, signifying a notable advancement in the field.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16809">An LLM-Based Digital Twin for Optimizing Human-in-the Loop Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqing Yang, Marie Siew, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things (CPS-IoT) applications and Foundation Models are enabling new applications that leverage real-time control of the environment. For example, real-time control of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce its usage when not needed for the comfort of human occupants, hence reducing energy consumption. Collecting real-time feedback on human preferences in such human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, however, is difficult in practice. We propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of dynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this paper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors and thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the elderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated into an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which employs the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn how to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show that LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large open spaces. Besides, AitL-RL demonstrates superior performance compared to the popular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and personalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT applications. Through this case study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced Foundation Models like LLMs into CPS-IoT to enhance system adaptability and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Ma, Qiaoyi Chen, Xinru Wang, Chengbo Zheng, Zhenhui Peng, Ming Yin, Xiaojuan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, humans often passively review AI's suggestion and decide whether to accept or reject it as a whole. In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans' appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixuan Hao, Wei Chen, Yibo Yan, Siru Zhong, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban indicator prediction aims to infer socio-economic metrics in diverse urban landscapes using data-driven methods. However, prevalent pre-trained models, particularly those reliant on satellite imagery, face dual challenges. Firstly, concentrating solely on macro-level patterns from satellite data may introduce bias, lacking nuanced details at micro levels, such as architectural details at a place. Secondly, the lack of interpretability in pre-trained models limits their utility in providing transparent evidence for urban planning. In response to these issues, we devise a novel Vision-Language Pre-Trained Model (UrbanVLP) in this paper. Our UrbanVLP seamlessly integrates multi-granularity information from both macro (satellite) and micro (street-view) levels, overcoming the limitations of prior pre-trained models. Moreover, it introduces automatic text generation and calibration, elevating interpretability in downstream applications by producing high-quality text descriptions of urban imagery. Rigorous experiments conducted across six socio-economic tasks underscore UrbanVLP's superior performance. We also deploy a web platform to verify its practicality.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843">Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanwoo Park, Xiangyu Liu, Asuman Ozdaglar, Kaiqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Qu, Daniel Gomm, Michael F\"arber</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs), crucial for modeling dynamic graphs with time-varying interactions, face a significant challenge in explainability due to their complex model structure. Counterfactual explanations, crucial for understanding model decisions, examine how input graph changes affect outcomes. This paper introduces two novel counterfactual explanation methods for TGNNs: GreeDy (Greedy Explainer for Dynamic Graphs) and CoDy (Counterfactual Explainer for Dynamic Graphs). They treat explanations as a search problem, seeking input graph alterations that alter model predictions. GreeDy uses a simple, greedy approach, while CoDy employs a sophisticated Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. Experiments show both methods effectively generate clear explanations. Notably, CoDy outperforms GreeDy and existing factual methods, with up to 59\% higher success rate in finding significant counterfactual inputs. This highlights CoDy's potential in clarifying TGNN decision-making, increasing their transparency and trustworthiness in practice.</p>

This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to retraction, thereby playing a role in predicting future retraction of problematic articles. A dataset comprising 3,505 retracted articles and their associated Twitter mentions is analyzed, alongside 3,505 non-retracted articles with similar characteristics obtained using the Coarsened Exact Matching method. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retraction is evaluated by four prediction methods, including manual labelling, keyword identification, machine learning models, and ChatGPT. Manual labelling results indicate that there are indeed retracted articles with their Twitter mentions containing recognizable evidence signaling problems before retraction, although they represent only a limited share of all retracted articles with Twitter mention data (approximately 16%). Using the manual labelling results as the baseline, ChatGPT demonstrates superior performance compared to other methods, implying its potential in assisting human judgment for predicting article retraction. This study uncovers both the potential and limitation of social media events as an early warning system for article retraction, shedding light on a potential application of generative artificial intelligence in promoting research integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josef Valvoda, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Current legal outcome prediction models - a staple of legal NLP - do not explain their reasoning. However, to employ these models in the real world, human legal actors need to be able to understand their decisions. In the case of common law, legal practitioners reason towards the outcome of a case by referring to past case law, known as precedent. We contend that precedent is, therefore, a natural way of facilitating explainability for legal NLP models. In this paper, we contribute a novel method for identifying the precedent employed by legal outcome prediction models. Furthermore, by developing a taxonomy of legal precedent, we are able to compare human judges and our models with respect to the different types of precedent they rely on. We find that while the models learn to predict outcomes reasonably well, their use of precedent is unlike that of human judges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Chai, Guoyin Wang, Jing Su, Tianjie Zhang, Xuanwen Huang, Xuwu Wang, Jingjing Xu, Jianbo Yuan, Hongxia Yang, Fei Wu, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoliang He, Eiko Yoneki</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become a significant workload since their appearance. However, they are also computationally expensive as they have billions of parameters and are trained with massive amounts of data. Thus, recent works have developed dedicated CUDA kernels for LLM training and inference instead of relying on compilergenerated ones, so that hardware resources are as fully utilized as possible. In this work, we explore the possibility of GPU native instruction optimization to further push the CUDA kernels to extreme performance. Contrary to prior works, we adopt an automatic optimization approach by defining a search space of possible GPU native instruction schedules, and then we apply stochastic search to perform optimization. Experiments show that SIP can further improve CUDA kernel throughput by automatically discovering better GPU native instruction schedules and the optimized schedules are tested by 10 million test samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien LaRocque, William Guimont-Martin, David-Alexandre Duclos, Philippe Gigu\`ere, Fran\c{c}ois Pomerleau</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works in field robotics highlighted the importance of resiliency against different types of terrains. Boreal forests, in particular, are home to many mobility-impeding terrains that should be considered for off-road autonomous navigation. Also, being one of the largest land biomes on Earth, boreal forests are an area where autonomous vehicles are expected to become increasingly common. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing BorealTC, a publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain classification (TC). Recorded with a Husky A200, our dataset contains 116 min of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), motor current, and wheel odometry data, focusing on typical boreal forest terrains, notably snow, ice, and silty loam. Combining our dataset with another dataset from the state-of-the-art, we evaluate both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the novel state space model (SSM)-based Mamba architecture on a TC task. Interestingly, we show that while CNN outperforms Mamba on each separate dataset, Mamba achieves greater accuracy when trained on a combination of both. In addition, we demonstrate that Mamba's learning capacity is greater than a CNN for increasing amounts of data. We show that the combination of two TC datasets yields a latent space that can be interpreted with the properties of the terrains. We also discuss the implications of merging datasets on classification. Our source code and dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealTC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Auste Simkute, Ewa Luger, Michael Evans, Rhianne Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous in domains such as medicine and natural science research. However, when AI systems are implemented in practice, domain experts often refuse them. Low acceptance hinders effective human-AI collaboration, even when it is essential for progress. In natural science research, scientists' ineffective use of AI-enabled systems can impede them from analysing their data and advancing their research. We conducted an ethnographically informed study of 10 in-depth interviews with AI practitioners and natural scientists at the organisation facing low adoption of algorithmic systems. Results were consolidated into recommendations for better AI adoption: i) actively supporting experts during the initial stages of system use, ii) communicating the capabilities of a system in a user-relevant way, and iii) following predefined collaboration rules. We discuss the broader implications of our findings and expand on how our proposed requirements could support practitioners and experts across domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaynah Dargaye, \"Onder G\"urcan, Florent Kirchner, Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed immutable ledgers, or blockchains, allow the secure digitization of evidential transactions without relying on a trusted third-party. Evidential transactions involve the exchange of any form of physical evidence, such as money, birth certificate, visas, tickets, etc. Most of the time, evidential transactions occur in the context of complex procedures, called evidential protocols, among physical agents. The blockchain provides the mechanisms to transfer evidence, while smart contracts - programs executing within the blockchain in a decentralized and replicated fashion - allow encoding evidential protocols on top of a blockchain.
  As a smart contract foregoes trusted third-parties and runs on several machines anonymously, it constitutes a highly critical program that has to be secure and trusted-by-design. While most of the current smart contract languages focus on easy programmability, they do not directly address the need of guaranteeing trust and accountability, which becomes a significant issue when evidential protocols are encoded as smart contracts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Keyaki, Ribeka Keyaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning in information retrieval systems using pre-trained language models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning. This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation and query-document relations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Ellenberger, Paul Haider, Jakob Jordan, Kevin Max, Ismael Jaras, Laura Kriener, Federico Benitez, Mihai A. Petrovici</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective learning in neuronal networks requires the adaptation of individual synapses given their relative contribution to solving a task. However, physical neuronal systems -- whether biological or artificial -- are constrained by spatio-temporal locality. How such networks can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In Machine Learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space (BP) and time (BPTT). However, BP(TT) is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatiotemporal (non-)locality, while forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) suffer from prohibitive memory constraints. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of BPTT in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, performing an effective spatiotemporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint states necessary for useful parameter updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhong Liu, Han Zhou, Zhijiang Guo, Ehsan Shareghi, Ivan Vulic, Anna Korhonen, Nigel Collier</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities as automatic evaluators in assessing the quality of generated natural language. However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human judgement, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating biases are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PAIRS), an uncertainty-guided search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons and efficiently ranks candidate texts. PAIRS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PAIRS benefits from calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Peiju Liu, Tianxiang Sun, Yunhua Zhou, Jun Zhan, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining data of large language models composes multiple domains (e.g., web texts, academic papers, codes), whose mixture proportions crucially impact the competence of outcome models. While existing endeavors rely on heuristics or qualitative strategies to tune the proportions, we discover the quantitative predictability of model performance regarding the mixture proportions in function forms, which we refer to as the data mixing laws. Fitting such functions on sample mixtures unveils model performance on unseen mixtures before actual runs, thus guiding the selection of an ideal data mixture. Furthermore, we propose nested use of the scaling laws of training steps, model sizes, and our data mixing law to enable predicting the performance of large models trained on massive data under various mixtures with only small-scale training. Moreover, experimental results verify that our method effectively optimizes the training mixture of a 1B model trained for 100B tokens in RedPajama, reaching a performance comparable to the one trained for 48% more steps on the default mixture. Extending the application of data mixing laws to continual training accurately predicts the critical mixture proportion that avoids catastrophic forgetting and outlooks the potential for dynamic data schedules</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Mei, Zelong Li, Shuyuan Xu, Ruosong Ye, Yingqiang Ge, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration and deployment of large language model (LLM)-based intelligent agents have been fraught with challenges that compromise their efficiency and efficacy. Among these issues are sub-optimal scheduling and resource allocation of agent requests over the LLM, the difficulties in maintaining context during interactions between agent and LLM, and the complexities inherent in integrating heterogeneous agents with different capabilities and specializations. The rapid increase of agent quantity and complexity further exacerbates these issues, often leading to bottlenecks and sub-optimal utilization of resources. Inspired by these challenges, this paper presents AIOS, an LLM agent operating system, which embeds large language model into operating systems (OS). Specifically, AIOS is designed to optimize resource allocation, facilitate context switch across agents, enable concurrent execution of agents, provide tool service for agents, and maintain access control for agents. We present the architecture of such an operating system, outline the core challenges it aims to resolve, and provide the basic design and implementation of the AIOS. Our experiments on concurrent execution of multiple agents demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of our AIOS modules. Through this, we aim to not only improve the performance and efficiency of LLM agents but also to pioneer for better development and deployment of the AIOS ecosystem in the future.

<p>Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Dahary, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have an unprecedented ability to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, they often struggle to faithfully capture the intended semantics of complex input prompts that include multiple subjects. Recently, numerous layout-to-image extensions have been introduced to improve user control, aiming to localize subjects represented by specific tokens. Yet, these methods often produce semantically inaccurate images, especially when dealing with multiple semantically or visually similar subjects. In this work, we study and analyze the causes of these limitations. Our exploration reveals that the primary issue stems from inadvertent semantic leakage between subjects in the denoising process. This leakage is attributed to the diffusion model's attention layers, which tend to blend the visual features of different subjects. To address these issues, we introduce Bounded Attention, a training-free method for bounding the information flow in the sampling process. Bounded Attention prevents detrimental leakage among subjects and enables guiding the generation to promote each subject's individuality, even with complex multi-subject conditioning. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method empowers the generation of multiple subjects that better align with given prompts and layouts.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16995">Language Rectified Flow: Advancing Diffusion Language Generation with Probabilistic Flows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shujian Zhang, Lemeng Wu, Chengyue Gong, Xingchao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated success in controlling sentence attributes ($e.g.$, sentiment) and structure ($e.g.$, syntactic structure) based on the diffusion language model. A key component that drives theimpressive performance for generating high-quality samples from noise is iteratively denoise for thousands of steps. While beneficial, the complexity of starting from the noise and the learning steps has limited its implementation to many NLP real-world applications. This paper proposes Language Rectified Flow ({\ours}). Our method is based on the reformulation of the standard probabilistic flow models. Language rectified flow learns (neural) ordinary differential equation models to transport between the source distribution and the target distribution, hence providing a unified and effective solution to generative modeling and domain transfer. From the source distribution, our language rectified flow yields fast simulation and effectively decreases the inference time. Experiments on three challenging fine-grained control tasks and multiple high-quality text editing show that our method consistently outperforms its baselines. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many NLP tasks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12340">mForms : Multimodal Form-Filling with Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Larry Heck, Simon Heck, Anirudh Sundar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to form-filling by reformulating the task as multimodal natural language Question Answering (QA). The reformulation is achieved by first translating the elements on the GUI form (text fields, buttons, icons, etc.) to natural language questions, where these questions capture the element's multimodal semantics. After a match is determined between the form element (Question) and the user utterance (Answer), the form element is filled through a pre-trained extractive QA system. By leveraging pre-trained QA models and not requiring form-specific training, this approach to form-filling is zero-shot. The paper also presents an approach to further refine the form-filling by using multi-task training to incorporate a potentially large number of successive tasks. Finally, the paper introduces a multimodal natural language form-filling dataset Multimodal Forms (mForms), as well as a multimodal extension of the popular ATIS dataset to support future research and experimentation. Results show the new approach not only maintains robust accuracy for sparse training conditions but achieves state-of-the-art F1 of 0.97 on ATIS with approximately 1/10th of the training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hormoz Shahrzad, Babak Hodjat, Risto Miikkulainen</p>
<p>Abstract: Most AI systems are black boxes generating reasonable outputs for given inputs. Some domains, however, have explainability and trustworthiness requirements that cannot be directly met by these approaches. Various methods have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training. This paper advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based on simple logical expressions. The approach is evaluated in several prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule sets that perform similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight into the domain, and make biases hidden in the data explicit. It may also be possible to edit them directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world applications in the future.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11624">Effective Integration of Weighted Cost-to-go and Conflict Heuristic within Suboptimal CBS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Veerapaneni, Tushar Kusnur, Maxim Likhachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solver that employs a low-level single agent planner and a high-level constraint tree to resolve conflicts. The vast majority of modern MAPF solvers focus on improving CBS by reducing the size of this tree through various strategies with few methods modifying the low level planner. Typically low level planners in existing CBS methods use an unweighted cost-to-go heuristic, with suboptimal CBS methods also using a conflict heuristic to help the high level search. In this paper, we show that, contrary to prevailing CBS beliefs, a weighted cost-to-go heuristic can be used effectively alongside the conflict heuristic in two possible variants. In particular, one of these variants can obtain large speedups, 2-100x, across several scenarios and suboptimal CBS methods. Importantly, we discover that performance is related not to the weighted cost-to-go heuristic but rather to the relative conflict heuristic weight's ability to effectively balance low-level and high-level work. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we show the first theoretical relation of prioritized planning and bounded suboptimal CBS and demonstrate that our methods are their natural generalization. Update March 2024: We found that the relative speedup decreases to around 1.2-10x depending on how the conflict heuristic is computed (see appendix for more details).</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11118">Dual Box Embeddings for the Description Logic EL++</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathias Jackermeier, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: OWL ontologies, whose formal semantics are rooted in Description Logic (DL), have been widely used for knowledge representation. Similar to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), ontologies are often incomplete, and maintaining and constructing them has proved challenging. While classical deductive reasoning algorithms use the precise formal semantics of an ontology to predict missing facts, recent years have witnessed growing interest in inductive reasoning techniques that can derive probable facts from an ontology. Similar to KGs, a promising approach is to learn ontology embeddings in a latent vector space, while additionally ensuring they adhere to the semantics of the underlying DL. While a variety of approaches have been proposed, current ontology embedding methods suffer from several shortcomings, especially that they all fail to faithfully model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations and role inclusion axioms. To address this problem and improve ontology completion performance, we propose a novel ontology embedding method named Box$^2$EL for the DL EL++, which represents both concepts and roles as boxes (i.e., axis-aligned hyperrectangles), and models inter-concept relationships using a bumping mechanism. We theoretically prove the soundness of Box$^2$EL and conduct an extensive experimental evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of datasets on the tasks of subsumption prediction, role assertion prediction, and approximating deductive reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is a critical technique in the field of natural language processing that involves designing and optimizing the prompts used to input information into models, aiming to enhance their performance on specific tasks. With the recent advancements in large language models, prompt engineering has shown significant superiority across various domains and has become increasingly important in the healthcare domain. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews specifically focusing on prompt engineering in the medical field. This review will introduce the latest advances in prompt engineering in the field of natural language processing for the medical field. First, we will provide the development of prompt engineering and emphasize its significant contributions to healthcare natural language processing applications such as question-answering systems, text summarization, and machine translation. With the continuous improvement of general large language models, the importance of prompt engineering in the healthcare domain is becoming increasingly prominent. The aim of this article is to provide useful resources and bridges for healthcare natural language processing researchers to better explore the application of prompt engineering in this field. We hope that this review can provide new ideas and inspire for research and application in medical natural language processing.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07942">Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion with GNNs and Rules: An Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Anil, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Yazm\'in Iba\~n\'ez-Garc\'ia, Steven Schockaert</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Chen Ma, Xueyang Feng, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Yang, Jingsen Zhang, Zhiyuan Chen, Jiakai Tang, Xu Chen, Yankai Lin, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhewei Wei, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research focus in both academic and industry communities. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field. To keep track of this field and continuously update our survey, we maintain a repository of relevant references at https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11585">Causal Intersectionality and Dual Form of Gradient Descent for Multimodal Analysis: a Case Study on Hateful Memes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Miyanishi, Minh Le Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Amidst the rapid expansion of Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding the semantics within their mechanisms is vital. Causal analyses define semantics, while gradient-based methods are essential to eXplainable AI (XAI), interpreting the model's 'black box'. Integrating these, we investigate how a model's mechanisms reveal its causal effect on evidence-based decision-making. Research indicates intersectionality - the combined impact of an individual's demographics - can be framed as an Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper demonstrates that hateful meme detection can be viewed as an ATE estimation using intersectionality principles, and summarized gradient-based attention scores highlight distinct behaviors of three Transformer models. We further reveal that LLM Llama-2 can discern the intersectional aspects of the detection through in-context learning and that the learning process could be explained via meta-gradient, a secondary form of gradient. In conclusion, this work furthers the dialogue on Causality and XAI. Our code is available online (see External Resources section).</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11528">Learning Complete Topology-Aware Correlations Between Relations for Inductive Link Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wang, Hanzhu Chen, Qitan Lv, Zhihao Shi, Jiajun Chen, Huarui He, Hongtao Xie, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive link prediction -- where entities during training and inference stages can be different -- has shown great potential for completing evolving knowledge graphs in an entity-independent manner. Many popular methods mainly focus on modeling graph-level features, while the edge-level interactions -- especially the semantic correlations between relations -- have been less explored. However, we notice a desirable property of semantic correlations between relations is that they are inherently edge-level and entity-independent. This implies the great potential of the semantic correlations for the entity-independent inductive link prediction task. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel subgraph-based method, namely TACO, to model Topology-Aware COrrelations between relations that are highly correlated to their topological structures within subgraphs. Specifically, we prove that semantic correlations between any two relations can be categorized into seven topological patterns, and then proposes Relational Correlation Network (RCN) to learn the importance of each pattern. To further exploit the potential of RCN, we propose Complete Common Neighbor induced subgraph that can effectively preserve complete topological patterns within the subgraph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TACO effectively unifies the graph-level information and edge-level interactions to jointly perform reasoning, leading to a superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods for the inductive link prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans are social beings; we pursue social goals in our daily interactions, which is a crucial aspect of social intelligence. Yet, AI systems' abilities in this realm remain elusive. We present SOTOPIA, an open-ended environment to simulate complex social interactions between artificial agents and evaluate their social intelligence. In our environment, agents role-play and interact under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval. With SOTOPIA, we find significant differences between these models in terms of their social intelligence, and we identify a subset of SOTOPIA scenarios, SOTOPIA-hard, that is generally challenging for all models. We find that on this subset, GPT-4 achieves a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans and struggles to exhibit social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. These findings demonstrate SOTOPIA's promise as a general platform for research on evaluating and improving social intelligence in artificial agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Calderonio</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the opacity of algorithms, contextualized in the open debate on responsibility for artificial intelligence causation; with an experimental approach by which, applying the proposed conversational methodology of the Turing Test, we expect to evaluate the performance of one of the best existing NLP model of generative AI (Chat-GPT) to see how far it can go right now and how the shape of a legal regulation of it could be. The analysis of the problem will be supported by a comment of Italian classical law categories such as causality, intent and fault to understand the problem of the usage of AI, focusing in particular on the human-machine interaction. On the computer science side, for a technical point of view of the logic used to craft these algorithms, in the second chapter will be proposed a practical interrogation of Chat-GPT aimed at finding some critical points of the functioning of AI. The end of the paper will concentrate on some existing legal solutions which can be applied to the problem, plus a brief description of the approach proposed by EU Artificial Intelligence act.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02760">Causal Question Answering with Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Bl\"ubaum, Stefan Heindorf</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal questions inquire about causal relationships between different events or phenomena. They are important for a variety of use cases, including virtual assistants and search engines. However, many current approaches to causal question answering cannot provide explanations or evidence for their answers. Hence, in this paper, we aim to answer causal questions with a causality graph, a large-scale dataset of causal relations between noun phrases along with the relations' provenance data. Inspired by recent, successful applications of reinforcement learning to knowledge graph tasks, such as link prediction and fact-checking, we explore the application of reinforcement learning on a causality graph for causal question answering. We introduce an Actor-Critic-based agent which learns to search through the graph to answer causal questions. We bootstrap the agent with a supervised learning procedure to deal with large action spaces and sparse rewards. Our evaluation shows that the agent successfully prunes the search space to answer binary causal questions by visiting less than 30 nodes per question compared to over 3,000 nodes by a naive breadth-first search. Our ablation study indicates that our supervised learning strategy provides a strong foundation upon which our reinforcement learning agent improves. The paths returned by our agent explain the mechanisms by which a cause produces an effect. Moreover, for each edge on a path, our causality graph provides its original source allowing for easy verification of paths.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07954">A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixin Hong, Hongming Zhang, Xinyu Pang, Dong Yu, Changshui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03009">I-PHYRE: Interactive Physical Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqian Li, Kewen Wu, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current evaluation protocols predominantly assess physical reasoning in stationary scenes, creating a gap in evaluating agents' abilities to interact with dynamic events. While contemporary methods allow agents to modify initial scene configurations and observe consequences, they lack the capability to interact with events in real time. To address this, we introduce I-PHYRE, a framework that challenges agents to simultaneously exhibit intuitive physical reasoning, multi-step planning, and in-situ intervention. Here, intuitive physical reasoning refers to a quick, approximate understanding of physics to address complex problems; multi-step denotes the need for extensive sequence planning in I-PHYRE, considering each intervention can significantly alter subsequent choices; and in-situ implies the necessity for timely object manipulation within a scene, where minor timing deviations can result in task failure. We formulate four game splits to scrutinize agents' learning and generalization of essential principles of interactive physical reasoning, fostering learning through interaction with representative scenarios. Our exploration involves three planning strategies and examines several supervised and reinforcement agents' zero-shot generalization proficiency on I-PHYRE. The outcomes highlight a notable gap between existing learning algorithms and human performance, emphasizing the imperative for more research in enhancing agents with interactive physical reasoning capabilities. The environment and baselines will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06203">Offloading and Quality Control for AI Generated Content Services in 6G Mobile Edge Computing Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Wang, Chang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-Generated Content (AIGC), as a novel manner of providing Metaverse services in the forthcoming Internet paradigm, can resolve the obstacles of immersion requirements. Concurrently, edge computing, as an evolutionary paradigm of computing in communication systems, effectively augments real-time interactive services. In pursuit of enhancing the accessibility of AIGC services, the deployment of AIGC models (e.g., diffusion models) to edge servers and local devices has become a prevailing trend. Nevertheless, this approach faces constraints imposed by battery life and computational resources when tasks are offloaded to local devices, limiting the capacity to deliver high-quality content to users while adhering to stringent latency requirements. So there will be a tradeoff between the utility of AIGC models and offloading decisions in the edge computing paradigm. This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for offloading decisions, computation time, and diffusion steps of the diffusion models in the reverse diffusion stage. Moreover, we take the average error into consideration as the metric for evaluating the quality of the generated results. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior joint optimization performance compared to the baselines.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15911">Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heyang Gong, Chaochao Lu, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of causal modeling, potential outcomes (PO) and structural causal models (SCMs) stand as the predominant frameworks. However, these frameworks face notable challenges in practically modeling counterfactuals, formalized as parameters of the joint distribution of potential outcomes. Counterfactual reasoning holds paramount importance in contemporary decision-making processes, especially in scenarios that demand personalized incentives based on the joint values of $(Y(0), Y(1))$. This paper begins with an investigation of the PO and SCM frameworks for modeling counterfactuals. Through the analysis, we identify an inherent model capacity limitation, termed as the ``degenerative counterfactual problem'', emerging from the consistency rule that is the cornerstone of both frameworks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel \textit{distribution-consistency} assumption, and in alignment with it, we propose the Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models (DiscoSCMs) offering enhanced capabilities to model counterfactuals. To concretely reveal the enhanced model capacity, we introduce a new identifiable causal parameter, \textit{the probability of consistency}, which holds practical significance within DiscoSCM alone, showcased with a personalized incentive example. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of theoretical results about the ``Ladder of Causation'' within the DiscoSCM framework. We hope it opens new avenues for future research of counterfactual modeling, ultimately enhancing our understanding of causality and its real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Lazzari, Stefano De Giorgis, Aldo Gangemi, Valentina Presutti</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents sandra, a neuro-symbolic reasoner combining vectorial representations with deductive reasoning. Sandra builds a vector space constrained by an ontology and performs reasoning over it. The geometric nature of the reasoner allows its combination with neural networks, bridging the gap with symbolic knowledge representations. Sandra is based on the Description and Situation (DnS) ontology design pattern, a formalization of frame semantics. Given a set of facts (a situation) it allows to infer all possible perspectives (descriptions) that can provide a plausible interpretation for it, even in presence of incomplete information. We prove that our method is correct with respect to the DnS model. We experiment with two different tasks and their standard benchmarks, demonstrating that, without increasing complexity, sandra (i) outperforms all the baselines (ii) provides interpretability in the classification process, and (iii) allows control over the vector space, which is designed a priori.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644">Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishwarya P S, Pranav Ajit Nair, Yashas Samaga, Toby Boyd, Sanjiv Kumar, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli</p>
<p>Abstract: The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.
  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Struppek, Minh Hieu Le, Dominik Hintersdorf, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has sparked widespread and general interest due to their strong language generation capabilities, offering great potential for both industry and research. While previous research delved into the security and privacy issues of LLMs, the extent to which these models can exhibit adversarial behavior remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp.~attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Li, Qiangchao Chen, Yiquan Wu, Ming Cai, Xiang Zhou, Fei Wu, Kun Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Confusing charge prediction is a challenging task in legal AI, which involves predicting confusing charges based on fact descriptions. While existing charge prediction methods have shown impressive performance, they face significant challenges when dealing with confusing charges, such as Snatch and Robbery. In the legal domain, constituent elements play a pivotal role in distinguishing confusing charges. Constituent elements are fundamental behaviors underlying criminal punishment and have subtle distinctions among charges. In this paper, we introduce a novel From Graph to Word Bag (FWGB) approach, which introduces domain knowledge regarding constituent elements to guide the model in making judgments on confusing charges, much like a judge's reasoning process. Specifically, we first construct a legal knowledge graph containing constituent elements to help select keywords for each charge, forming a word bag. Subsequently, to guide the model's attention towards the differentiating information for each charge within the context, we expand the attention mechanism and introduce a new loss function with attention supervision through words in the word bag. We construct the confusing charges dataset from real-world judicial documents. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially in maintaining exceptional performance in imbalanced label distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The focus of recent research has shifted from merely improving the metrics based performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to DNNs which are more interpretable to humans. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has observed various techniques, including saliency-based and concept-based approaches. These approaches explain the model's decisions in simple human understandable terms called Concepts. Concepts are known to be the thinking ground of humans}. Explanations in terms of concepts enable detecting spurious correlations, inherent biases, or clever-hans. With the advent of concept-based explanations, a range of concept representation methods and automatic concept discovery algorithms have been introduced. Some recent works also use concepts for model improvement in terms of interpretability and generalization. We provide a systematic review and taxonomy of various concept representations and their discovery algorithms in DNNs, specifically in vision. We also provide details on concept-based model improvement literature marking the first comprehensive survey of these methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14589">ReAct Meets ActRe: Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories for Contrastive Self-Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghan Yang, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models. Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotation or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03820">Learning Concepts Definable in First-Order Logic with Counting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen van Bergerem</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04132">A Number Sense as an Emergent Property of the Manipulating Brain</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Neehar Kondapaneni, Pietro Perona</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which humans acquire and develop this ability is still poorly understood. We explore this question through a model, assuming that the learner is able to pick up and place small objects from, and to, locations of its choosing, and will spontaneously engage in such undirected manipulation. We further assume that the learner's visual system will monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn to predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a supervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard deep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent learning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action prediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities that foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity. These include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a strict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate numerosity, i.e. the number of objects in the scene, as well as subitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. Remarkably, subitization and numerosity estimation extrapolate to scenes containing many objects, far beyond the three objects used during training. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned with supervision from a simple pre-training task. Our observations suggest that cross-modal learning is a powerful learning mechanism that may be harnessed in artificial intelligence.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15400">A Theoretical Understanding of Gradient Bias in Meta-Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xidong Feng, Bo Liu, Jie Ren, Luo Mai, Rui Zhu, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based Meta-RL (GMRL) refers to methods that maintain two-level optimisation procedures wherein the outer-loop meta-learner guides the inner-loop gradient-based reinforcement learner to achieve fast adaptations. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that describes variations of GMRL algorithms and points out that existing stochastic meta-gradient estimators adopted by GMRL are actually \textbf{biased}. Such meta-gradient bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias incurred by the two-level problem structure, which has an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}\big(K\alpha^{K}\hat{\sigma}_{\text{In}}|\tau|^{-0.5}\big)$ \emph{w.r.t.} inner-loop update step $K$, learning rate $\alpha$, estimate variance $\hat{\sigma}^{2}_{\text{In}}$ and sample size $|\tau|$, and 2) the multi-step Hessian estimation bias $\hat{\Delta}_{H}$ due to the use of autodiff, which has a polynomial impact $\mathcal{O}\big((K-1)(\hat{\Delta}_{H})^{K-1}\big)$ on the meta-gradient bias. We study tabular MDPs empirically and offer quantitative evidence that testifies our theoretical findings on existing stochastic meta-gradient estimators. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Atari games to show how other methods such as off-policy learning and low-bias estimator can help fix the gradient bias for GMRL algorithms in general.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12074">On The Effectiveness of One-Class Support Vector Machine in Different Defect Prediction Scenarios</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebecca Moussa, Danielle Azar, Federica Sarro</p>
<p>Abstract: Defect prediction aims at identifying software components that are likely to cause faults before a software is made available to the end-user. To date, this task has been modeled as a two-class classification problem, however its nature also allows it to be formulated as a one-class classification task. Previous studies show that One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) can outperform two-class classifiers for within-project defect prediction, however it is not effective when employed at a finer granularity (i.e., commit-level defect prediction). In this paper, we further investigate whether learning from one class only is sufficient to produce effective defect prediction model in two other different scenarios (i.e., granularity), namely cross-version and cross-project defect prediction models, as well as replicate the previous work at within-project granularity for completeness. Our empirical results confirm that OCSVM performance remain low at different granularity levels, that is, it is outperformed by the two-class Random Forest (RF) classifier for both cross-version and cross-project defect prediction. While, we cannot conclude that OCSVM is the best classifier, our results still show interesting findings. While OCSVM does not outperform RF, it still achieves performance superior to its two-class counterpart (i.e., SVM) as well as other two-class classifiers studied herein. We also observe that OCSVM is more suitable for both cross-version and cross-project defect prediction, rather than for within-project defect prediction, thus suggesting it performs better with heterogeneous data. We encourage further research on one-class classifiers for defect prediction as these techniques may serve as an alternative when data about defective modules is scarce or not available.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study focuses on two important problems related to applying offline model-based optimization to real-world industrial control problems. The first problem is how to create a reliable probabilistic model that accurately captures the dynamics present in noisy industrial data. The second problem is how to reliably optimize control parameters without actively collecting feedback from industrial systems. Specifically, we introduce a novel cGAN ensemble-based uncertainty-aware surrogate model for reliable offline model-based optimization in industrial control problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on two representative cases, namely a discrete control case and a continuous control case. The results of these experiments show that our method outperforms several competitive baselines in the field of offline model-based optimization for industrial control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Longitudinal imaging is able to capture both static anatomical structures and dynamic changes in disease progression towards earlier and better patient-specific pathology management. However, conventional approaches for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) rarely take advantage of longitudinal information to improve DR analysis. In this work, we investigate the benefit of exploiting self-supervised learning with a longitudinal nature for DR diagnosis purposes. We compare different longitudinal self-supervised learning (LSSL) methods to model the disease progression from longitudinal retinal color fundus photographs (CFP) to detect early DR severity changes using a pair of consecutive exams. The experiments were conducted on a longitudinal DR screening dataset with or without those trained encoders (LSSL) acting as a longitudinal pretext task. Results achieve an AUC of 0.875 for the baseline (model trained from scratch) and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.9593-0.9655 DeLong test) with a p-value < 2.2e-16 on early fusion using a simple ResNet alike architecture with frozen LSSL weights, suggesting that the LSSL latent space enables to encode the dynamic of DR progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has been a field of increasing interest, aiming to combine various modalities in a single joint representation. Especially in the area of visiolinguistic (VL) learning multiple models and techniques have been developed, targeting a variety of tasks that involve images and text. VL models have reached unprecedented performances by extending the idea of Transformers, so that both modalities can learn from each other. Massive pre-training procedures enable VL models to acquire a certain level of real-world understanding, although many gaps can be identified: the limited comprehension of commonsense, factual, temporal and other everyday knowledge aspects questions the extendability of VL tasks. Knowledge graphs and other knowledge sources can fill those gaps by explicitly providing missing information, unlocking novel capabilities of VL models. In the same time, knowledge graphs enhance explainability, fairness and validity of decision making, issues of outermost importance for such complex implementations. The current survey aims to unify the fields of VL representation learning and knowledge graphs, and provides a taxonomy and analysis of knowledge-enhanced VL models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Mahowald, Anna A. Ivanova, Idan A. Blank, Nancy Kanwisher, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Evelina Fedorenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have come closest among all models to date to mastering human language, yet opinions about their linguistic and cognitive capabilities remain split. Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal linguistic competence - knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns - and functional linguistic competence - understanding and using language in the world. We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of mechanisms specialized for formal linguistic competence, distinct from functional competence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Furutanpey, Philipp Raith, Schahram Dustdar</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of mobile AI accelerators allows latency-sensitive applications to execute lightweight Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on the client side. However, critical applications require powerful models that edge devices cannot host and must therefore offload requests, where the high-dimensional data will compete for limited bandwidth. This work proposes shifting away from focusing on executing shallow layers of partitioned DNNs. Instead, it advocates concentrating the local resources on variational compression optimized for machine interpretability. We introduce a novel framework for resource-conscious compression models and extensively evaluate our method in an environment reflecting the asymmetric resource distribution between edge devices and servers. Our method achieves 60% lower bitrate than a state-of-the-art SC method without decreasing accuracy and is up to 16x faster than offloading with existing codec standards.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06928">CiPR: An Efficient Framework with Cross-instance Positive Relations for Generalized Category Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaozhe Hao, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the issue of generalized category discovery (GCD). GCD considers the open-world problem of automatically clustering a partially labelled dataset, in which the unlabelled data may contain instances from both novel categories and labelled classes. In this paper, we address the GCD problem with an unknown category number for the unlabelled data. We propose a framework, named CiPR, to bootstrap the representation by exploiting Cross-instance Positive Relations in the partially labelled data for contrastive learning, which have been neglected in existing methods. To obtain reliable cross-instance relations to facilitate representation learning, we introduce a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named selective neighbor clustering (SNC), which can produce a clustering hierarchy directly from the connected components of a graph constructed from selective neighbors. We further present a method to estimate the unknown class number using SNC with a joint reference score that considers clustering indexes of both labelled and unlabelled data, and extend SNC to allow label assignment for the unlabelled instances with a given class number. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on public generic image recognition datasets and challenging fine-grained datasets, and establish a new state-of-the-art. Code: https://github.com/haoosz/CiPR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Ma, Xinchi Qiu, Daniel J. Beutel, Nicholas D. Lane</p>
<p>Abstract: The privacy-sensitive nature of decentralized datasets and the robustness of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on tabular data raise the needs to train XGBoost in the context of federated learning (FL). Existing works on federated XGBoost in the horizontal setting rely on the sharing of gradients, which induce per-node level communication frequency and serious privacy concerns. To alleviate these problems, we develop an innovative framework for horizontal federated XGBoost which does not depend on the sharing of gradients and simultaneously boosts privacy and communication efficiency by making the learning rates of the aggregated tree ensembles learnable. We conduct extensive evaluations on various classification and regression datasets, showing our approach achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art method and effectively improves communication efficiency by lowering both communication rounds and communication overhead by factors ranging from 25x to 700x.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11959">A Forward and Backward Compatible Framework for Few-shot Class-incremental Pill Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghua Zhang, Li Liu, Kai Gao, Dewen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Pill Recognition (APR) systems are crucial for enhancing hospital efficiency, assisting visually impaired individuals, and preventing cross-infection. However, most existing deep learning-based pill recognition systems can only perform classification on classes with sufficient training data. In practice, the high cost of data annotation and the continuous increase in new pill classes necessitate the development of a few-shot class-incremental pill recognition system. This paper introduces the first few-shot class-incremental pill recognition framework, named Discriminative and Bidirectional Compatible Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (DBC-FSCIL). It encompasses forward-compatible and backward-compatible learning components. In forward-compatible learning, we propose an innovative virtual class synthesis strategy and a Center-Triplet (CT) loss to enhance discriminative feature learning. These virtual classes serve as placeholders in the feature space for future class updates, providing diverse semantic knowledge for model training. For backward-compatible learning, we develop a strategy to synthesize reliable pseudo-features of old classes using uncertainty quantification, facilitating Data Replay (DR) and Knowledge Distillation (KD). This approach allows for the flexible synthesis of features and effectively reduces additional storage requirements for samples and models. Additionally, we construct a new pill image dataset for FSCIL and assess various mainstream FSCIL methods, establishing new benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhang-jinghua/DBC-FSCIL.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12519">LLM Paternity Test: Generated Text Detection with LLM Genetic Inheritance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Yu, Yuang Qi, Kejiang Chen, Guoqiang Chen, Xi Yang, Pengyuan Zhu, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate texts that carry the risk of various misuses, including plagiarism, planting fake reviews on e-commerce platforms, or creating inflammatory false tweets. Detecting whether a text is machine-generated has thus become increasingly important. While existing detection methods exhibit superior performance, they often lack generalizability due to their heavy dependence on training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a model-related generated text detection method, the LLM Paternity Test (LLM-Pat). Specifically, given any candidate text (\textit{child}), LLM-Pat employs an intermediary LLM (\textit{parent}) to reconstruct a \textit{sibling} text corresponding to the given text and then measures the similarity between candidate texts and their sibling texts. High similarity indicates that the candidate text is machine-generated, akin to genetic traits. We have constructed datasets encompassing four scenarios: student responses in educational settings, news creation, academic paper writing, and social media bots to assess the performance of LLM-Pat. The experiments show that LLM-Pat outperforms the existing detection methods and is more robust against paraphrasing attacks and re-translating attacks. Besides, LLM-Pat can also be used to trace which large language model the text was generated by. The constructed dataset and code will be released to benefit the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yu, Xingxuan Zhang, Renzhe Xu, Jiashuo Liu, Yue He, Peng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization aims to solve the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization by leveraging common knowledge learned from multiple training domains to generalize to unseen test domains. To accurately evaluate the OOD generalization ability, it is required that test data information is unavailable. However, the current domain generalization protocol may still have potential test data information leakage. This paper examines the risks of test data information leakage from two aspects of the current evaluation protocol: supervised pretraining on ImageNet and oracle model selection. We propose modifications to the current protocol that we should employ self-supervised pretraining or train from scratch instead of employing the current supervised pretraining, and we should use multiple test domains. These would result in a more precise evaluation of OOD generalization ability. We also rerun the algorithms with the modified protocol and introduce new leaderboards to encourage future research in domain generalization with a fairer comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenpeng Su, Xing Wu, Wei Zhou, Guangyuan Ma, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialogue response selection aims to select an appropriate response from several candidates based on a given user and system utterance history. Most existing works primarily focus on post-training and fine-tuning tailored for cross-encoders. However, there are no post-training methods tailored for dense encoders in dialogue response selection. We argue that when the current language model, based on dense dialogue systems (such as BERT), is employed as a dense encoder, it separately encodes dialogue context and response, leading to a struggle to achieve the alignment of both representations. Thus, we propose Dial-MAE (Dialogue Contextual Masking Auto-Encoder), a straightforward yet effective post-training technique tailored for dense encoders in dialogue response selection. Dial-MAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to compress the dialogue semantics into dense vectors, which achieves better alignment between the features of the dialogue context and response. Our experiments have demonstrated that Dial-MAE is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two commonly evaluated benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Zimmer, Christoph Spiegel, Sebastian Pokutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks can be significantly compressed by pruning, yielding sparse models with reduced storage and computational demands while preserving predictive performance. Model soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) enhance generalization and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance by averaging the parameters of multiple models into a single one, without increasing inference time. However, achieving both sparsity and parameter averaging is challenging as averaging arbitrary sparse models reduces the overall sparsity due to differing sparse connectivities. This work addresses these challenges by demonstrating that exploring a single retraining phase of Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) with varied hyperparameter configurations such as batch ordering or weight decay yields models suitable for averaging, sharing identical sparse connectivity by design. Averaging these models significantly enhances generalization and OOD performance over their individual counterparts. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Model Soups (SMS), a novel method for merging sparse models by initiating each prune-retrain cycle with the averaged model from the previous phase. SMS preserves sparsity, exploits sparse network benefits, is modular and fully parallelizable, and substantially improves IMP's performance. We further demonstrate that SMS can be adapted to enhance state-of-the-art pruning-during-training approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Opioid related aberrant behaviors (ORABs) present novel risk factors for opioid overdose. This paper introduces a novel biomedical natural language processing benchmark dataset named ODD, for ORAB Detection Dataset. ODD is an expert-annotated dataset designed to identify ORABs from patients' EHR notes and classify them into nine categories; 1) Confirmed Aberrant Behavior, 2) Suggested Aberrant Behavior, 3) Opioids, 4) Indication, 5) Diagnosed opioid dependency, 6) Benzodiazepines, 7) Medication Changes, 8) Central Nervous System-related, and 9) Social Determinants of Health. We explored two state-of-the-art natural language processing models (fine-tuning and prompt-tuning approaches) to identify ORAB. Experimental results show that the prompt-tuning models outperformed the fine-tuning models in most categories and the gains were especially higher among uncommon categories (Suggested Aberrant Behavior, Confirmed Aberrant Behaviors, Diagnosed Opioid Dependence, and Medication Change). Although the best model achieved the highest 88.17% on macro average area under precision recall curve, uncommon classes still have a large room for performance improvement. ODD is publicly available.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09985">Our Model Achieves Excellent Performance on MovieLens: What Does it Mean?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-chen Fan, Yitong Ji, Jie Zhang, Aixin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: A typical benchmark dataset for recommender system (RecSys) evaluation consists of user-item interactions generated on a platform within a time period. The interaction generation mechanism partially explains why a user interacts with (e.g., like, purchase, rate) an item, and the context of when a particular interaction happened. In this study, we conduct a meticulous analysis of the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact of using the dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal recommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive interaction process. We further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction generation mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of typical real-world recommendation scenarios. In summary, the MovieLens platform demonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to address cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation accuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in practice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the contexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user knowledge about the item collections. While results on MovieLens can be useful as a reference, they should not be solely relied upon as the primary justification for the effectiveness of a recommendation system model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have extended the spectrum of Web of Things for intelligent vehicles and have become an important component of the Web ecosystem. Similar to traditional Web-based applications, fairness is an essential aspect for ensuring the high quality of autonomous driving systems, particularly in the context of pedestrian detectors within them. However, there is an absence in the literature of a comprehensive assessment of the fairness of current Deep Learning (DL)-based pedestrian detectors. To fill the gap, we evaluate eight widely-explored DL-based pedestrian detectors across demographic groups on large-scale real-world datasets. To enable a thorough fairness evaluation, we provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in 8,311 images with 16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone labels. Our findings reveal significant fairness issues related to age. The undetected proportions for adults are 20.14% lower compared to children. Furthermore, we explore how various driving scenarios affect the fairness of pedestrian detectors. We find that the bias may exacerbate for children and females towards low brightness and low contrast.</p>

Under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption, our approach has several advantages compared to existing methods. Firstly, it has optimal dependence on $\epsilon$, which stands for the ratio of attacked clients. Secondly, our approach does not need precise knowledge of $\epsilon$. Thirdly, it allows different clients to have unequal data sizes. We then broaden our analysis to include non-i.i.d data, such that clients have slightly different distributions.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15991">DRL-Based Trajectory Tracking for Motion-Related Modules in Autonomous Driving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinda Xu, Lidong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are always built on motion-related modules such as the planner and the controller. An accurate and robust trajectory tracking method is indispensable for these motion-related modules as a primitive routine. Current methods often make strong assumptions about the model such as the context and the dynamics, which are not robust enough to deal with the changing scenarios in a real-world system. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based trajectory tracking method for the motion-related modules in autonomous driving systems. The representation learning ability of DL and the exploration nature of RL bring strong robustness and improve accuracy. Meanwhile, it enhances versatility by running the trajectory tracking in a model-free and data-driven manner. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our method compared to current methods. Code and documentation are released to facilitate both further research and industrial deployment.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01069">Separable Hamiltonian Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Yu Khoo, Dawen Wu, Jonathan Sze Choong Low, St\'ephane Bressan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) are state-of-the-art models that regress the vector field of a dynamical system under the learning bias of Hamilton's equations. A recent observation is that embedding a bias regarding the additive separability of the Hamiltonian reduces the regression complexity and improves regression performance. We propose separable HNNs that embed additive separability within HNNs using observational, learning, and inductive biases. We show that the proposed models are more effective than the HNN at regressing the Hamiltonian and the vector field, and have the capability to interpret the kinetic and potential energy of the system.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01157">Large Language Models for Generative Recommendation: A Survey and Visionary Discussions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Li, Yongfeng Zhang, Dugang Liu, Li Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) not only have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to reshape many other fields, e.g., recommender systems (RS). However, most of the related work treats an LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g., as a feature extractor), which may not be able to fully leverage the generative power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple stages, such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods, and future directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions: 1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for various RS tasks. We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance needed to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juraj Vladika, Phillip Schneider, Florian Matthes</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital age, seeking health advice on the Internet has become a common practice. At the same time, determining the trustworthiness of online medical content is increasingly challenging. Fact-checking has emerged as an approach to assess the veracity of factual claims using evidence from credible knowledge sources. To help advance automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for this task, in this paper we introduce a novel dataset HealthFC. It consists of 750 health-related claims in German and English, labeled for veracity by medical experts and backed with evidence from systematic reviews and clinical trials. We provide an analysis of the dataset, highlighting its characteristics and challenges. The dataset can be used for NLP tasks related to automated fact-checking, such as evidence retrieval, claim verification, or explanation generation. For testing purposes, we provide baseline systems based on different approaches, examine their performance, and discuss the findings. We show that the dataset is a challenging test bed with a high potential for future use.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13339">Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models through Logic</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xufeng Zhao, Mengdi Li, Wenhao Lu, Cornelius Weber, Jae Hee Lee, Kun Chu, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have showcased their remarkable generalizability across various domains. However, their reasoning abilities still have significant room for improvement, especially when confronted with scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning. Although large language models possess extensive knowledge, their reasoning often fails to effectively utilize this knowledge to establish a coherent thinking paradigm. These models sometimes show hallucinations as their reasoning procedures are unconstrained by logical principles. Aiming at improving the zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning ability of large language models, we propose LoT (Logical Thoughts), a self-improvement prompting framework that leverages principles rooted in symbolic logic, particularly Reductio ad Absurdum, to systematically verify and rectify the reasoning processes step by step. Experimental evaluations conducted on language tasks in diverse domains, including arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic, causal inference, and social problems, demonstrate the efficacy of enhanced reasoning by logic. The implementation code for LoT can be accessed at: \url{https://github.com/xf-zhao/LoT}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Ota, Devesh K. Jha, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Asako Kanezaki, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise perception of contact interactions is essential for fine-grained manipulation skills for robots. In this paper, we present the design of feedback skills for robots that must learn to stack complex-shaped objects on top of each other (see Fig.1). To design such a system, a robot should be able to reason about the stability of placement from very gentle contact interactions. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to infer the stability of object placement based on tactile readings during contact formation between the object and its environment. In particular, we estimate the contact patch between a grasped object and its environment using force and tactile observations to estimate the stability of the object during a contact formation. The contact patch could be used to estimate the stability of the object upon release of the grasp. The proposed method is demonstrated in various pairs of objects that are used in a very popular board game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Loconte, Aleksanteri M. Sladek, Stefan Mengel, Martin Trapp, Arno Solin, Nicolas Gillis, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture models are traditionally represented and learned by adding several distributions as components. Allowing mixtures to subtract probability mass or density can drastically reduce the number of components needed to model complex distributions. However, learning such subtractive mixtures while ensuring they still encode a non-negative function is challenging. We investigate how to learn and perform inference on deep subtractive mixtures by squaring them. We do this in the framework of probabilistic circuits, which enable us to represent tensorized mixtures and generalize several other subtractive models. We theoretically prove that the class of squared circuits allowing subtractions can be exponentially more expressive than traditional additive mixtures; and, we empirically show this increased expressiveness on a series of real-world distribution estimation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Ashok, \'Etienne Marcotte, Valentina Zantedeschi, Nicolas Chapados, Alexandre Drouin</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new model for multivariate probabilistic time series prediction, designed to flexibly address a range of tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and their combinations. Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Fidel A. Guerrero Pena, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Thomas Dubail, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: A powerful way to adapt a visual recognition model to a new domain is through image translation. However, common image translation approaches only focus on generating data from the same distribution as the target domain. Given a cross-modal application, such as pedestrian detection from aerial images, with a considerable shift in data distribution between infrared (IR) to visible (RGB) images, a translation focused on generation might lead to poor performance as the loss focuses on irrelevant details for the task. In this paper, we propose HalluciDet, an IR-RGB image translation model for object detection. Instead of focusing on reconstructing the original image on the IR modality, it seeks to reduce the detection loss of an RGB detector, and therefore avoids the need to access RGB data. This model produces a new image representation that enhances objects of interest in the scene and greatly improves detection performance. We empirically compare our approach against state-of-the-art methods for image translation and for fine-tuning on IR, and show that our HalluciDet improves detection accuracy in most cases by exploiting the privileged information encoded in a pre-trained RGB detector.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Jiang, Qiang Zhang, Jingkai Sun, Jiahang Cao, Jingtong Ma, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, legged robots based on deep reinforcement learning have made remarkable progress. Quadruped robots have demonstrated the ability to complete challenging tasks in complex environments and have been deployed in real-world scenarios to assist humans. Simultaneously, bipedal and humanoid robots have achieved breakthroughs in various demanding tasks. Current reinforcement learning methods can utilize diverse robot bodies and historical information to perform actions. However, prior research has not emphasized the speed and energy consumption of network inference, as well as the biological significance of the neural networks themselves. Most of the networks employed are traditional artificial neural networks that utilize multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In this paper, we successfully apply a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to process legged robots, achieving outstanding results across a range of simulated terrains. SNN holds a natural advantage over traditional neural networks in terms of inference speed and energy consumption, and their pulse-form processing of body perception signals offers improved biological interpretability. Applying more biomimetic neural networks to legged robots can further reduce the heat dissipation and structural burden caused by the high power consumption of neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement SNN in legged robots.</p>

Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process within the Transformer. Further, within the inner optimization, we discover and theoretically analyze a special characteristic of the norms of learned token representations within Transformer-based causal language models.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06707">Quality-Aware Translation Models: Efficient Generation and Quality Estimation in a Single Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Tomani, David Vilar, Markus Freitag, Colin Cherry, Subhajit Naskar, Mara Finkelstein, Xavier Garcia, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding is the most widely used decoding strategy for neural machine translation (NMT) models. The underlying assumption is that model probability correlates well with human judgment, with better translations getting assigned a higher score by the model. However, research has shown that this assumption does not always hold, and generation quality can be improved by decoding to optimize a utility function backed by a metric or quality-estimation signal, as is done by Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) or Quality-Aware decoding. The main disadvantage of these approaches is that they require an additional model to calculate the utility function during decoding, significantly increasing the computational cost. In this paper, we propose to make the NMT models themselves quality-aware by training them to estimate the quality of their own output. Using this approach for MBR decoding we can drastically reduce the size of the candidate list, resulting in a speed-up of two-orders of magnitude. When applying our method to MAP decoding we obtain quality gains similar or even superior to quality reranking approaches, but with the efficiency of single pass decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesc Wilhelmi, Nima Afraz, Elia Guerra, Paolo Dini</p>
<p>Abstract: Blockchain promises to enhance distributed machine learning (ML) approaches such as federated learning (FL) by providing further decentralization, security, immutability, and trust, which are key properties for enabling collaborative intelligence in next-generation applications. Nonetheless, the intrinsic decentralized operation of peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes leads to an uncharted setting for FL, whereby the concepts of FL round and global model become meaningless, as devices' synchronization is lost without the figure of a central orchestrating server. In this paper, we study the practical implications of outsourcing the orchestration of FL to a democratic setting such as in a blockchain. In particular, we focus on the effects that model staleness and inconsistencies, endorsed by blockchains' modus operandi, have on the training procedure held by FL devices asynchronously. Using simulation, we evaluate the blockchained FL operation by applying two different ML models (ranging from low to high complexity) on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and focus on the accuracy and timeliness of the solutions. Our results show the high impact of model inconsistencies on the accuracy of the models (up to a ~35% decrease in prediction accuracy), which underscores the importance of properly designing blockchain systems based on the characteristics of the underlying FL application.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08446">Towards Robust Multi-Modal Reasoning via Model Selection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyan Liu, Rongxue Li, Wei Ji, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) are widely acknowledged in recent research, inspiring studies on tool learning and autonomous agents. LLM serves as the "brain" of the agent, orchestrating multiple tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking tools like calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, current multi-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarily focus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefined task-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile, other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with or suboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance of dependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning. To this end, we identify the key challenges therein and propose the $\textit{M}^3$ framework as a plug-in with negligible runtime overhead at test-time. This framework improves model selection and bolsters the robustness of multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning. In the absence of suitable benchmarks, we create MS-GQA, a new dataset specifically designed to investigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents. Our experiments reveal that our framework enables dynamic model selection, considering both user inputs and subtask dependencies, thereby robustifying the overall reasoning process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rose E. Wang, Qingyang Zhang, Carly Robinson, Susanna Loeb, Dorottya Demszky</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling high-quality tutoring remains a major challenge in education. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities. Our work explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to close the novice-expert knowledge gap in remediating math mistakes. We contribute Bridge, a method that uses cognitive task analysis to translate an expert's latent thought process into a decision-making model for remediation. This involves an expert identifying (A) the student's error, (B) a remediation strategy, and (C) their intention before generating a response. We construct a dataset of 700 real tutoring conversations, annotated by experts with their decisions. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset and find that the expert's decision-making model is critical for LLMs to close the gap: responses from GPT4 with expert decisions (e.g., ``simplify the problem'') are +76% more preferred than without. Additionally, context-sensitive decisions are critical to closing pedagogical gaps: random decisions decrease GPT4's response quality by -97% than expert decisions. Our work shows the potential of embedding expert thought processes in LLM generations to enhance their capability to bridge novice-expert knowledge gaps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhan Zhong, Sizhe Song, Weipeng Zhuo, Guanyao Li, Yang Liu, S. -H. Gary Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data, including univariate and multivariate ones, are characterized by unique composition and complex multi-scale temporal variations. They often require special consideration of decomposition and multi-scale modeling to analyze. Existing deep learning methods on this best fit to univariate time series only, and have not sufficiently considered sub-series modeling and decomposition completeness. To address these challenges, we propose MSD-Mixer, a Multi-Scale Decomposition MLP-Mixer, which learns to explicitly decompose and represent the input time series in its different layers. To handle the multi-scale temporal patterns and multivariate dependencies, we propose a novel temporal patching approach to model the time series as multi-scale patches, and employ MLPs to capture intra- and inter-patch variations and channel-wise correlations. In addition, we propose a novel loss function to constrain both the mean and the autocorrelation of the decomposition residual for better decomposition completeness. Through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets for five common time series analysis tasks, we demonstrate that MSD-Mixer consistently and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with better efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Battery degradation remains a pivotal concern in the energy storage domain, with machine learning emerging as a potent tool to drive forward insights and solutions. However, this intersection of electrochemical science and machine learning poses complex challenges. Machine learning experts often grapple with the intricacies of battery science, while battery researchers face hurdles in adapting intricate models tailored to specific datasets.

Recognizing these impediments, we present BatteryML - a one-step, all-encompass, and open-source platform designed to unify data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of both traditional and state-of-the-art models. This streamlined approach promises to enhance the practicality and efficiency of research applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Yan, Haomin Wen, Siru Zhong, Wei Chen, Haodong Chen, Qingsong Wen, Roger Zimmermann, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban region profiling from web-sourced data is of utmost importance for urban planning and sustainable development. We are witnessing a rising trend of LLMs for various fields, especially dealing with multi-modal data research such as vision-language learning, where the text modality serves as a supplement information for the image. Since textual modality has never been introduced into modality combinations in urban region profiling, we aim to answer two fundamental questions in this paper: i) Can textual modality enhance urban region profiling? ii) and if so, in what ways and with regard to which aspects? To answer the questions, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduce the first-ever LLM-enhanced framework that integrates the knowledge of textual modality into urban imagery profiling, named LLM-enhanced Urban Region Profiling with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (UrbanCLIP). Specifically, it first generates a detailed textual description for each satellite image by an open-source Image-to-Text LLM. Then, the model is trained on the image-text pairs, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for urban visual representation learning, jointly with contrastive loss and language modeling loss. Results on predicting three urban indicators in four major Chinese metropolises demonstrate its superior performance, with an average improvement of 6.1% on R^2 compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and the image-language dataset will be released upon paper notification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang You, Bokui Shen, Congyue Deng, Haoran Geng, Songlin Wei, He Wang, Leonidas Guibas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. Our project page: https://qq456cvb.github.io/projects/donut.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03056">LitSumm: Large language models for literature summarisation of non-coding RNAs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Green, Carlos Ribas, Nancy Ontiveros-Palacios, Sam Griffiths-Jones, Anton I. Petrov, Alex Bateman, Blake Sweeney</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: Curation of literature in life sciences is a growing challenge. The continued increase in the rate of publication, coupled with the relatively fixed number of curators worldwide presents a major challenge to developers of biomedical knowledgebases. Very few knowledgebases have resources to scale to the whole relevant literature and all have to prioritise their efforts.
  Results: In this work, we take a first step to alleviating the lack of curator time in RNA science by generating summaries of literature for non-coding RNAs using large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that high-quality, factually accurate summaries with accurate references can be automatically generated from the literature using a commercial LLM and a chain of prompts and checks. Manual assessment was carried out for a subset of summaries, with the majority being rated extremely high quality. We also applied the most commonly used automated evaluation approaches, finding that they do not correlate with human assessment. Finally, we apply our tool to a selection of over 4,600 ncRNAs and make the generated summaries available via the RNAcentral resource. We conclude that automated literature summarization is feasible with the current generation of LLMs, provided careful prompting and automated checking are applied.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Danesh Pazho, Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Vinit Katariya, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing roadway safety has become an essential computer vision focus area for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potentials of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explainability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a new field growing in the last few years. In this publication we address the problem of determining how important is each neighbor for the GNN when classifying a node and how to measure the performance for this specific task. To do this, various known explainability methods are reformulated to get the neighbor importance and four new metrics are presented. Our results show that there is almost no difference between the explanations provided by gradient-based techniques in the GNN domain. In addition, many explainability techniques failed to identify important neighbors when GNNs without self-loops are used.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks in various domains. Despite their impressive performance, they can be unreliable due to factual errors in their generations. Assessing their confidence and calibrating them across different tasks can help mitigate risks and enable LLMs to produce better generations. There has been a lot of recent research aiming to address this, but there has been no comprehensive overview to organize it and outline the main lessons learned. The present survey aims to bridge this gap. In particular, we outline the challenges and we summarize recent technical advancements for LLM confidence estimation and calibration. We further discuss their applications and suggest promising directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaowei Zhu, Jialu Wang, Hao Cheng, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets. We provide an open-source tool, Docta, for data cleaning at https://github.com/Docta-ai/docta.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13231">Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yang, Jian Tao, Jiafei Lyu, Chunjiang Ge, Jiaxin Chen, Qimai Li, Weihan Shen, Xiaolong Zhu, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yk7333/D3PO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifan Yu, Juncheng Li, Longhui Wei, Liang Pang, Wentao Ye, Bosheng Qin, Siliang Tang, Qi Tian, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16515">Word4Per: Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su, Yuan Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%. The code and ITCPR dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/Word4Per.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07527">BaRDa: A Belief and Reasoning Dataset that Separates Factual Accuracy and Reasoning Ability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Clark, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Oyvind Tafjord</p>
<p>Abstract: While there are numerous benchmarks comparing the performance of modern language models (LMs), end-task evaluations often conflate notions of *factual accuracy* ("truth") and *reasoning ability* ("rationality", or "honesty" in the sense of correctly reporting implications of beliefs). Our goal is a dataset that clearly distinguishes these two notions. Our approach is to leverage and extend a collection of human-annotated *entailment trees*, engineered to express both good and bad chains of reasoning, and using a mixture of true and false facts, in particular including counterfactual examples, to avoid belief bias (also known as the "content effect"). The resulting dataset, called BaRDa, contains 3000 entailments (1787 valid, 1213 invalid), using 6681 true and 2319 false statements. Testing on four GPT-series models, GPT3(curie)/GPT3(davinici)/3.5/4, we find factual accuracy (truth) scores of 74.1/80.6/82.6/87.1 and reasoning accuracy scores of 63.1/78.0/71.8/79.2. This shows the clear progression of models towards improved factual accuracy and entailment reasoning, and the dataset provides a new benchmark that more cleanly separates and quantifies these two notions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhang, Zhening Xing, Yanhong Zeng, Youqing Fang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized text-to-image (T2I) models have revolutionized content creation, empowering non-experts to generate stunning images with unique styles. While promising, adding realistic motions into these personalized images by text poses significant challenges in preserving distinct styles, high-fidelity details, and achieving motion controllability by text. In this paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in aligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning. To achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained temporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is the introduction of the condition module, which utilizes the condition frame and inter-frame affinity as input to transfer appearance information guided by the affinity hint for individual frame synthesis in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related image alignment within and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14149">TagAlign: Improving Vision-Language Alignment with Multi-Tag Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinying Liu, Wei Wu, Kecheng Zheng, Zhan Tong, Yu Liu, Wei Chen, Zilei Wang, Yujun Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The crux of learning vision-language models is to extract semantically aligned information from visual and linguistic data. Existing attempts usually face the problem of coarse alignment, e.g., the vision encoder struggles in localizing an attribute-specified object. In this work, we propose an embarrassingly simple approach to better align image and text features with no need of additional data formats other than image-text pairs. Concretely, given an image and its paired text, we manage to parse objects (\textit{e.g.}, cat) and attributes (\textit{e.g.}, black) from the description, which are highly likely to exist in the image. It is noteworthy that the parsing pipeline is fully automatic and thus enjoys good scalability. With these parsed semantics as supervision signals, we can complement the commonly used image-text contrastive loss with the multi-tag classification loss. Extensive experimental results on a broad suite of semantic segmentation datasets substantiate the average 5.2\% improvement of our framework over existing alternatives. Furthermore, the visualization results indicate that attribute supervision makes vision-language models accurately localize attribute-specified objects.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14481">SurgicalPart-SAM: Part-to-Whole Collaborative Prompting for Surgical Instrument Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxi Yue, Jing Zhang, Kun Hu, Qiuxia Wu, Zongyuan Ge, Yong Xia, Jiebo Luo, Zhiyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits promise in generic object segmentation and offers potential for various applications. Existing methods have applied SAM to surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) by tuning SAM-based frameworks with surgical data. However, they fall short in two crucial aspects: (1) Straightforward model tuning with instrument masks treats each instrument as a single entity, neglecting their complex structures and fine-grained details; and (2) Instrument category-based prompts are not flexible and informative enough to describe instrument structures. To address these problems, in this paper, we investigate text promptable SIS and propose SurgicalPart-SAM (SP-SAM), a novel SAM efficient-tuning approach that explicitly integrates instrument structure knowledge with SAM's generic knowledge, guided by expert knowledge on instrument part compositions. Specifically, we achieve this by proposing (1) Collaborative Prompts that describe instrument structures via collaborating category-level and part-level texts; (2) Cross-Modal Prompt Encoder that encodes text prompts jointly with visual embeddings into discriminative part-level representations; and (3) Part-to-Whole Adaptive Fusion and Hierarchical Decoding that adaptively fuse the part-level representations into a whole for accurate instrument segmentation in surgical scenarios. Built upon them, SP-SAM acquires a better capability to comprehend surgical instruments in terms of both overall structure and part-level details. Extensive experiments on both the EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate SP-SAM's state-of-the-art performance with minimal tunable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifan Jiang, Xing Huang, Chao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning is a key technology for aligning language models with human values. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a model-based algorithm to optimize preference learning, which first fits a reward model for preference scores and then optimizes the generating policy with an on-policy PPO algorithm to maximize the reward. The processing of RLHF is complex, time-consuming, and unstable. The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm uses an off-policy algorithm to directly optimize the generating policy and eliminates the need for a reward model. DPO is more data-efficient and stable. However, DPO has a drawback of overfitting to the preference data and ignoring the KL-regularization term when the preference is deterministic. Identity mapping Preference Optimization(IPO) uses a root-finding MSE loss to incorporate KL-regularization. However, both DPO and IPO fail to properly address the KL-regularization term because the support of the preference distribution is not equal to the reference distribution. In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive off-policy preference optimization algorithm from an importance sampling view, which we call Maximum Preference Optimization (MPO). MPO incorporates the off-policy KL-regularization term, making regularization truly effective. MPO achieves the best of both worlds by combining the objectives of RLHF and IPO while being an off-policy algorithm. Furthermore, MPO eliminates the need for a reward model and reference policy, simplifying the learning process and reducing memory usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Haitao Zhou, Chuang Wang, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVGs) synthesis has shown promise in domains such as iconography and sketch. However, existing text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual quality and result diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background, thereby enhancing editability. Specifically, the SIVE process introduce attention-based primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and manipulation of individual elements. Additionally, we propose a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to tackle the challenges of shape over-smoothing, color over-saturation, limited diversity in results, and slow convergence in existing text-to-SVG generation methods. VPSD models SVGs as distributions of control points and colors to counteract over-smoothing and over-saturation. Furthermore, VPSD leverages a reward model to reweight vector particles, which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SVGDreamer, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03695">A Large-Scale Empirical Study on Improving the Fairness of Image Classification Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Yang, Jiajun Jiang, Zeyu Sun, Junjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness has been a critical issue that affects the adoption of deep learning models in real practice. To improve model fairness, many existing methods have been proposed and evaluated to be effective in their own contexts. However, there is still no systematic evaluation among them for a comprehensive comparison under the same context, which makes it hard to understand the performance distinction among them, hindering the research progress and practical adoption of them. To fill this gap, this paper endeavours to conduct the first large-scale empirical study to comprehensively compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art fairness improving techniques. Specifically, we target the widely-used application scenario of image classification, and utilized three different datasets and five commonly-used performance metrics to assess in total 13 methods from diverse categories. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the performance of each method across different datasets and sensitive attributes, indicating over-fitting on specific datasets by many existing methods. Furthermore, different fairness evaluation metrics, due to their distinct focuses, yield significantly different assessment results. Overall, we observe that pre-processing methods and in-processing methods outperform post-processing methods, with pre-processing methods exhibiting the best performance. Our empirical study offers comprehensive recommendations for enhancing fairness in deep learning models. We approach the problem from multiple dimensions, aiming to provide a uniform evaluation platform and inspire researchers to explore more effective fairness solutions via a set of implications.</p>

Recent researchers have sought to leverage the additional textual or linguistic information of these rare categories with a pre-trained language model to facilitate learning, thus partially alleviating the problem of insufficient supervision signals. However, the full potential of the textual information and pre-trained language model have been underestimated in the few-shot learning till now, resulting in limited performance enhancements. To address this, we propose a simple but effective framework for few-shot learning tasks, specifically designed to exploit the textual information and language model. In more detail, we explicitly exploit the zero-shot capability of the pre-trained language model with the learnable prompt. And we just add the visual feature with the textual feature for inference directly without the intricate designed fusion modules in previous works. Additionally, we apply the self-ensemble and distillation to further enhance these components. Our extensive experiments conducted across four widely used few-shot datasets demonstrate that our simple framework achieves impressive results. Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance in the 1-shot learning task, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.0\% in classification accuracy. \footnote{We will make the source codes of the proposed framework publicly available upon acceptance. }.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayug Maniparambil, Raiymbek Akshulakov, Yasser Abdelaziz Dahou Djilali, Sanath Narayan, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Karttikeya Mangalam, Noel E. O'Connor</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligned text-image encoders such as CLIP have become the de facto model for vision-language tasks. Furthermore, modality-specific encoders achieve impressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a central question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP, we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization, and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual, cross-domain caption matching and image classification.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06461">Between Lines of Code: Unraveling the Distinct Patterns of Machine and Human Programmers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuling Shi, Hongyu Zhang, Chengcheng Wan, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have catalyzed an unprecedented wave in code generation. While achieving significant advances, they blur the distinctions between machine- and human-authored source code, causing integrity and authenticity issues of software artifacts. Previous methods such as DetectGPT have proven effective in discerning machine-generated texts, but they do not identify and harness the unique patterns of machine-generated code. Thus, its applicability falters when applied to code. In this paper, we carefully study the specific patterns that characterize machine- and human-authored code. Through a rigorous analysis of code attributes such as lexical diversity, conciseness, and naturalness, we expose unique patterns inherent to each source. We particularly notice that the syntactic segmentation of code is a critical factor in identifying its provenance. Based on our findings, we propose DetectCodeGPT, a novel method for detecting machine-generated code, which improves DetectGPT by capturing the distinct stylized patterns of code. Diverging from conventional techniques that depend on external LLMs for perturbations, DetectCodeGPT perturbs the code corpus by strategically inserting spaces and newlines, ensuring both efficacy and efficiency. Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting machine-generated code.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11504">With Greater Text Comes Greater Necessity: Inference-Time Training Helps Long Text Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Y. Wang, D. Ma, D. Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Man Luo, Xin Xu, Yue Liu, Panupong Pasupat, Mehran Kazemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models, especially pre-trained large language models, have showcased remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward, leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training procedures, and inference algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Chen, Lumei Su, Lihua Chen, Zhiwei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, the LCV2 modular method is proposed for the Grounded Visual Question Answering task in the vision-language multimodal domain. This approach relies on a frozen large language model (LLM) as intermediate mediator between the off-the-shelf VQA model and the off-the-shelf visual grounding (VG) model, where the LLM transforms and conveys textual information between the two modules based on a designed prompt. LCV2 establish an integrated plug-and-play framework without the need for any pre-training process. This framework can be deployed for VQA Grounding tasks under low computational resources. The modularized model within the framework allows application with various state-of-the-art pre-trained models, exhibiting significant potential to be advance with the times. Experimental implementations were conducted under constrained computational and memory resources, evaluating the proposed method's performance on benchmark datasets including GQA, CLEVR, and VizWiz-VQA-Grounding. Comparative analyses with baseline methods demonstrate the robust competitiveness of LCV2.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548">Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanghan Xu, Kang Chen, Tao Han, Hao Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven weather forecast based on machine learning (ML) has experienced rapid development and demonstrated superior performance in the global medium-range forecast compared to traditional physics-based dynamical models. However, most of these ML models struggle with accurately predicting extreme weather, which is closely related to the extreme value prediction. Through mathematical analysis, we prove that the use of symmetric losses, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), leads to biased predictions and underestimation of extreme values. To address this issue, we introduce Exloss, a novel loss function that performs asymmetric optimization and highlights extreme values to obtain accurate extreme weather forecast. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free extreme value enhancement strategy named ExEnsemble, which increases the variance of pixel values and improves the forecast robustness. Combined with an advanced global weather forecast model, extensive experiments show that our solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather prediction, while maintaining the overall forecast accuracy comparable to the top medium-range forecast models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwoo Park, Daehoon Gwak, Jaegul Choo, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term forecasting presents unique challenges due to the time and memory complexity of handling long sequences. Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02423">Uni-RLHF: Universal Platform and Benchmark Suite for Reinforcement Learning with Diverse Human Feedback</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Yuan, Jianye Hao, Yi Ma, Zibin Dong, Hebin Liang, Jinyi Liu, Zhixin Feng, Kai Zhao, Yan Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has received significant attention for performing tasks without the need for costly manual reward design by aligning human preferences. It is crucial to consider diverse human feedback types and various learning methods in different environments. However, quantifying progress in RLHF with diverse feedback is challenging due to the lack of standardized annotation platforms and widely used unified benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-RLHF, a comprehensive system implementation tailored for RLHF. It aims to provide a complete workflow from real human feedback, fostering progress in the development of practical problems. Uni-RLHF contains three packages: 1) a universal multi-feedback annotation platform, 2) large-scale crowdsourced feedback datasets, and 3) modular offline RLHF baseline implementations. Uni-RLHF develops a user-friendly annotation interface tailored to various feedback types, compatible with a wide range of mainstream RL environments. We then establish a systematic pipeline of crowdsourced annotations, resulting in large-scale annotated datasets comprising more than 15 million steps across 30+ popular tasks. Through extensive experiments, the results in the collected datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to those from well-designed manual rewards. We evaluate various design choices and offer insights into their strengths and potential areas of improvement. We wish to build valuable open-source platforms, datasets, and baselines to facilitate the development of more robust and reliable RLHF solutions based on realistic human feedback.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04599">Meet JEANIE: a Similarity Measure for 3D Skeleton Sequences via Temporal-Viewpoint Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Jun Liu, Liang Zheng, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Video sequences exhibit significant nuisance variations (undesired effects) of speed of actions, temporal locations, and subjects' poses, leading to temporal-viewpoint misalignment when comparing two sets of frames or evaluating the similarity of two sequences. Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmera viewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3D skeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulated in 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where matching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of support-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is essential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we create its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support sequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be matched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal index, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint warping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with different temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only performs temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to clustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure. JEANIE achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics-skeleton and UWA3D Multiview Activity II on supervised and unsupervised FSAR, and their meta-learning inspired fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and integrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09494">Can AI and humans genuinely communicate?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Constant Bonard</p>
<p>Abstract: Can AI and humans genuinely communicate? In this article, after giving some background and motivating my proposal (sections 1 to 3), I explore a way to answer this question that I call the "mental-behavioral methodology" (sections 4 and 5). This methodology follows the following three steps: First, spell out what mental capacities are sufficient for human communication (as opposed to communication more generally). Second, spell out the experimental paradigms required to test whether a behavior exhibits these capacities. Third, apply or adapt these paradigms to test whether an AI displays the relevant behaviors. If the first two steps are successfully completed, and if the AI passes the tests with human-like results, this constitutes evidence that this AI and humans can genuinely communicate. This mental-behavioral methodology has the advantage that we don't need to understand the workings of black-box algorithms, such as standard deep neural networks. This is comparable to the fact that we don't need to understand how human brains work to know that humans can genuinely communicate. This methodology also has its disadvantages and I will discuss some of them (section 6).</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10685">LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Lu, Xin Zhou, Wei He, Jun Zhao, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands. Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models. We release our code at https://github.com/LuLuLuyi/LongHeads .</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly replacing help forums like StackOverflow, and are especially helpful for non-professional programmers and end users. These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without including the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data to include in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answering this question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: By consolidating scattered knowledge, the literature review provides a comprehensive understanding of the investigated topic. However, reading, conducting, or peer-reviewing review papers generally demands a significant investment of time and effort from researchers. To improve efficiency, this paper aims to provide a thorough review of reviews in the PAMI field from diverse perspectives. First, this paper proposes several article-level, field-normalized, and large language model-empowered bibliometric indicators to evaluate reviews. To facilitate this, a meta-data database dubbed RiPAMI, and a topic dataset are constructed. Second, based on these indicators, the study presents comparative analyses of representative reviews, unveiling the characteristics of publications across various fields, periods, and journals. The newly emerging AI-generated literature reviews are also appraised, and the observed differences suggest that most AI-generated reviews still lag behind human-authored reviews in multiple aspects. Third, we briefly provide a subjective evaluation of representative PAMI reviews and introduce a paper structure-based typology of literature reviews. This typology may improve the clarity and effectiveness for scholars in reading and writing reviews, while also serving as a guide for AI systems in generating well-organized reviews. Finally, this work offers insights into the current challenges of literature reviews and envisions future directions for their development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritwik Mishra, Pooja Desur, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Coreference resolution involves the task of identifying text spans within a discourse that pertain to the same real-world entity. While this task has been extensively explored in the English language, there has been a notable scarcity of publicly accessible resources and models for coreference resolution in South Asian languages. We introduce a Translated dataset for Multilingual Coreference Resolution (TransMuCoRes) in 31 South Asian languages using off-the-shelf tools for translation and word-alignment. Nearly all of the predicted translations successfully pass a sanity check, and 75% of English references align with their predicted translations. Using multilingual encoders, two off-the-shelf coreference resolution models were trained on a concatenation of TransMuCoRes and a Hindi coreference resolution dataset with manual annotations. The best performing model achieved a score of 64 and 68 for LEA F1 and CoNLL F1, respectively, on our test-split of Hindi golden set. This study is the first to evaluate an end-to-end coreference resolution model on a Hindi golden set. Furthermore, this work underscores the limitations of current coreference evaluation metrics when applied to datasets with split antecedents, advocating for the development of more suitable evaluation metrics.</p>

We present a novel approach to extract distinguishing lexical features of dialects by utilizing interpretable dialect classifiers, even in the absence of human experts.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046">SEED: Customize Large Language Models with Sample-Efficient Adaptation for Code Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Jiang, Yihong Dong, Zhi Jin, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training samples available in practice lead to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training samples is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named SEED, which stands for Sample-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. SEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome its own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, SEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, SEED achieves superior performance with few training samples, showing an average relative improvement of 54.7% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, SEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heegon Jin, Seonil Son, Jemin Park, Youngseok Kim, Hyungjong Noh, Yeonsoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of scalable deep models and large datasets has improved the performance of Neural Machine Translation. Knowledge Distillation (KD) enhances efficiency by transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a more compact student model. However, KD approaches to Transformer architecture often rely on heuristics, particularly when deciding which teacher layers to distill from. In this paper, we introduce the 'Align-to-Distill' (A2D) strategy, designed to address the feature mapping problem by adaptively aligning student attention heads with their teacher counterparts during training. The Attention Alignment Module in A2D performs a dense head-by-head comparison between student and teacher attention heads across layers, turning the combinatorial mapping heuristics into a learning problem. Our experiments show the efficacy of A2D, demonstrating gains of up to +3.61 and +0.63 BLEU points for WMT-2022 De->Dsb and WMT-2014 En->De, respectively, compared to Transformer baselines.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03881">Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian B. Moser, Federico Raue, Sebastian Palacio, Stanislav Frolov, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of machine learning has traditionally relied on the availability of increasingly larger datasets. However, large datasets pose storage challenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during training without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to these limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into a condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged. One crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed model architecture differs from the model used during distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images, e.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with dataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel diffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the gradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several ImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256). As a result, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation techniques by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning tools are remarkably effective in addressing intricate problems. However, their operation as black-box models introduces increased uncertainty in predictions. Additionally, they contend with various challenges, including the need for substantial storage space in large networks, issues of overfitting, underfitting, vanishing gradients, and more. This study explores the concept of Bayesian Neural Networks, presenting a novel architecture designed to significantly alleviate the storage space complexity of a network. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm adept at efficiently handling uncertainties, ensuring robust convergence values without becoming trapped in local optima, particularly when the objective function lacks perfect convexity.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05030">Defending Against Unforeseen Failure Modes with Latent Adversarial Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Casper, Lennart Schulze, Oam Patel, Dylan Hadfield-Menell</p>
<p>Abstract: AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors post-deployment. This is often despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers. Minimizing risks from models is challenging because the attack surface is so large. It is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may cause a model to fail. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to make AI systems more robust. However, they have not been sufficient to avoid many real-world failure modes that differ from the ones adversarially trained on. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without generating inputs that elicit them. LAT leverages the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. We use LAT to remove trojans and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054">Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Soo Min Kwon, Ismail R. Alkhouri, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06725">Improving Low-Resource Knowledge Tracing Tasks by Supervised Pre-training and Importance Mechanism Fine-tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyuan Zhang, Zitao Liu, Shuyan Huang, Chenming Shang, Bojun Zhan, Yong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate student's knowledge mastery based on their historical interactions. Recently, the deep learning based KT (DLKT) approaches have achieved impressive performance in the KT task. These DLKT models heavily rely on the large number of available student interactions. However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy concerns, observed interactions are very limited in many real-world scenarios, a.k.a, low-resource KT datasets. Directly training a DLKT model on a low-resource KT dataset may lead to overfitting and it is difficult to choose the appropriate deep neural architecture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a low-resource KT framework called LoReKT to address above challenges. Inspired by the prevalent "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, we aim to learn transferable parameters and representations from rich-resource KT datasets during the pre-training stage and subsequently facilitate effective adaptation to low-resource KT datasets. Specifically, we simplify existing sophisticated DLKT model architectures with purely a stack of transformer decoders. We design an encoding mechanism to incorporate student interactions from multiple KT data sources and develop an importance mechanism to prioritize updating parameters with high importance while constraining less important ones during the fine-tuning stage. We evaluate LoReKT on six public KT datasets and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of AUC and Accuracy. To encourage reproducible research, we make our data and code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LoReKT-C619.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Tianyu Liu, Shuai Bai, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/FastV.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09506">Don&#x27;t Judge by the Look: Towards Motion Coherent Video Representation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Zhang, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current training pipelines in object recognition neglect Hue Jittering when doing data augmentation as it not only brings appearance changes that are detrimental to classification, but also the implementation is inefficient in practice. In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11259">A learning-based solution approach to the application placement problem in mobile edge computing under uncertainty</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha-Hossein Hejazi, Zahra Ghadimkhani, Arezoo Borji</p>
<p>Abstract: Placing applications in mobile edge computing servers presents a complex challenge involving many servers, users, and their requests. Existing algorithms take a long time to solve high-dimensional problems with significant uncertainty scenarios. Therefore, an efficient approach is required to maximize the quality of service while considering all technical constraints. One of these approaches is machine learning, which emulates optimal solutions for application placement in edge servers. Machine learning models are expected to learn how to allocate user requests to servers based on the spatial positions of users and servers. In this study, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming. A sufficient amount of training records is generated by varying parameters such as user locations, their request rates, and solving the optimization model. Then, based on the distance features of each user from the available servers and their request rates, machine learning models generate decision variables for the first stage of the stochastic optimization model, which is the user-to-server request allocation, and are employed as independent decision agents that reliably mimic the optimization model. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this research to achieve practical decisions from the stochastic optimization models. The performance of each model has shown an execution effectiveness of over 80%. This research aims to provide a more efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional problems and scenarios with uncertainties in mobile edge computing by leveraging machine learning models for optimal decision-making in request allocation to edge servers. These results suggest that machine-learning models can significantly improve solution times compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rao Fu, Jingyu Liu, Xilun Chen, Yixin Nie, Wenhan Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Scene-LLM, a 3D-visual-language model that enhances embodied agents' abilities in interactive 3D indoor environments by integrating the reasoning strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs). Scene-LLM adopts a hybrid 3D visual feature representation, that incorporates dense spatial information and supports scene state updates. The model employs a projection layer to efficiently project these features in the pre-trained textual embedding space, enabling effective interpretation of 3D visual information. Unique to our approach is the integration of both scene-level and ego-centric 3D information. This combination is pivotal for interactive planning, where scene-level data supports global planning and ego-centric data is important for localization. Notably, we use ego-centric 3D frame features for feature alignment, an efficient technique that enhances the model's ability to align features of small objects within the scene. Our experiments with Scene-LLM demonstrate its strong capabilities in dense captioning, question answering, and interactive planning. We believe Scene-LLM advances the field of 3D visual understanding and reasoning, offering new possibilities for sophisticated agent interactions in indoor settings.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11838">Ensuring Safe and High-Quality Outputs: A Guideline Library Approach for Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Luo, Zhenghao Lin, Yuhao Zhang, Jiashuo Sun, Chen Lin, Chengjin Xu, Xiangdong Su, Yelong Shen, Jian Guo, Yeyun Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but also present risks such as biased content generation and privacy issues. One of the current alignment techniques includes principle-driven integration, but it faces challenges arising from the imprecision of manually crafted rules and inadequate risk perception in models without safety training. To address these, we introduce Guide-Align, a two-stage approach. Initially, a safety-trained model identifies potential risks and formulates specific guidelines for various inputs, establishing a comprehensive library of guidelines and a model for input-guidelines retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval model correlates new inputs with relevant guidelines, which guide LLMs in response generation to ensure safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. An additional optional stage involves fine-tuning a model with well-aligned datasets generated through the process implemented in the second stage. Our method customizes guidelines to accommodate diverse inputs, thereby enhancing the fine-grainedness and comprehensiveness of the guideline library. Furthermore, it incorporates safety expertise from a safety-trained LLM through a lightweight retrieval model. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM security and quality. Notably, our fine-tuned model, Labrador, even at 13 billion parameters, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses GPT-4 in alignment capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision-making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13597">No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query optimizer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Haodi Ma, Daisy Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of machine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries. However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should not be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda, a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort are saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization can be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods consistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those by the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved innovative advancements in various fields, including the analysis of human emotions and behaviors. Initiatives such as the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition have been particularly instrumental in driving research in this area by providing diverse and challenging datasets that enable precise evaluation of complex emotional states. This study leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transformer models to focus on the estimation of Valence-Arousal (VA), which signifies the positivity and intensity of emotions, recognition of various facial expressions, and detection of Action Units (AU) representing fundamental muscle movements. This approach transcends traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based methods, proposing a new Transformer-based framework that maximizes the understanding of temporal and spatial features. The core contributions of this research include the introduction of a learning technique through random frame masking and the application of Focal loss adapted for imbalanced data, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of emotion and behavior analysis in real-world settings. This approach is expected to contribute to the advancement of emotional computing and deep learning methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongqi Yang, Yuning Wang, Ken S. Yamashita, Maryam Sabah, Elahe Khatibi, Iman Azimi, Nikil Dutt, Jessica L. Borelli, Amir M. Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional states, as indicators of affect, are pivotal to overall health, making their accurate prediction before onset crucial. Current studies are primarily centered on immediate short-term affect detection using data from wearable and mobile devices. These studies typically focus on objective sensory measures, often neglecting other forms of self-reported information like diaries and notes. In this paper, we propose a multimodal deep learning model for affect status forecasting. This model combines a transformer encoder with a pre-trained language model, facilitating the integrated analysis of objective metrics and self-reported diaries. To validate our model, we conduct a longitudinal study, enrolling college students and monitoring them over a year, to collect an extensive dataset including physiological, environmental, sleep, metabolic, and physical activity parameters, alongside open-ended textual diaries provided by the participants. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves predictive accuracy of 82.50% for positive affect and 82.76% for negative affect, a full week in advance. The effectiveness of our model is further elevated by its explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyendu Sarkar, Avisek Naug, Ricardo Luna, Antonio Guillen, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Sajad Mousavi, Dejan Markovikj, Ashwin Ramesh Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption, sustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority for governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in optimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads based on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging battery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using collaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization strategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and the power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a real-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic real-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint Reduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that optimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the DC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in optimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various locations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity conditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE controller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy usage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across multiple geographical regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee Suk Yoon, Eunseop Yoon, Joshua Tian Jin Tee, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, Yingzhen Li, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14689">Developing and Deploying Industry Standards for Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED): Challenges, Strategies, and Future Directions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Tong, Haoyang Li, Joleen Liang, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) holds the promise of revolutionizing educational practices by offering personalized learning experiences, automating administrative and pedagogical tasks, and reducing the cost of content creation. However, the lack of standardized practices in the development and deployment of AIED solutions has led to fragmented ecosystems, which presents challenges in interoperability, scalability, and ethical governance. This article aims to address the critical need to develop and implement industry standards in AIED, offering a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape, challenges, and strategic approaches to overcome these obstacles. We begin by examining the various applications of AIED in various educational settings and identify key areas lacking in standardization, including system interoperability, ontology mapping, data integration, evaluation, and ethical governance. Then, we propose a multi-tiered framework for establishing robust industry standards for AIED. In addition, we discuss methodologies for the iterative development and deployment of standards, incorporating feedback loops from real-world applications to refine and adapt standards over time. The paper also highlights the role of emerging technologies and pedagogical theories in shaping future standards for AIED. Finally, we outline a strategic roadmap for stakeholders to implement these standards, fostering a cohesive and ethical AIED ecosystem. By establishing comprehensive industry standards, such as those by IEEE Artificial Intelligence Standards Committee (AISC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), we can accelerate and scale AIED solutions to improve educational outcomes, ensuring that technological advances align with the principles of inclusivity, fairness, and educational excellence.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14692">The AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) in action: A pilot implementation of GenAI supported assessment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Furze, Mike Perkins, Jasper Roe, Jason MacVaugh</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies in higher education has raised concerns about academic integrity, assessment practices, and student learning. Banning or blocking GenAI tools has proven ineffective, and punitive approaches ignore the potential benefits of these technologies. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study conducted at British University Vietnam (BUV) exploring the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), a flexible framework for incorporating GenAI into educational assessments. The AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from 'No AI' to 'Full AI', enabling educators to design assessments that focus on areas requiring human input and critical thinking.
  Following the implementation of the AIAS, the pilot study results indicate a significant reduction in academic misconduct cases related to GenAI, a 5.9% increase in student attainment across the university, and a 33.3% increase in module passing rates. The AIAS facilitated a shift in pedagogical practices, with faculty members incorporating GenAI tools into their modules and students producing innovative multimodal submissions. The findings suggest that the AIAS can support the effective integration of GenAI in HE, promoting academic integrity while leveraging the technology's potential to enhance learning experiences.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15048">Cartoon Hallucinations Detection: Pose-aware In Context Visual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bumsoo Kim, Wonseop Shin, Kyuchul Lee, Sanghyun Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern, especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15317">Point-DETR3D: Leveraging Imagery Data with Spatial Point Prior for Weakly Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhi Gao, Zheng Chen, Zehui Chen, Lin Chen, Jiaming Liu, Shanghang Zhang, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Training high-accuracy 3D detectors necessitates massive labeled 3D annotations with 7 degree-of-freedom, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for object localization. In this paper, we empirically discover that it is non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional prior. Considering the low quality of pseudo labels at distant regions produced by the teacher model, we enhance the detector's perception by incorporating dense imagery data through a novel Cross-Modal Deformable RoI Fusion (D-RoI).Moreover, an innovative point-guided self-supervised learning technique is proposed to allow for fully exploiting point priors, even in student models.Extensive experiments on representative nuScenes dataset demonstrate our Point-DETR3D obtains significant improvements compared to previous works. Notably, with only 5% of labeled data, Point-DETR3D achieves over 90% performance of its fully supervised counterpart.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15388">LLaVA-PruMerge: Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Large Multimodal Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Mu Cai, Bingxin Xu, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 18 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.
