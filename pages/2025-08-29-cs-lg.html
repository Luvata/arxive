<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruobing Wang, Qiaoyu Tan, Yili Wang, Ying Wang, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation. Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method, which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs. We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional and unconditional generation tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20206">Filter then Attend: Improving attention-based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Filtering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisha Dayag, Nhat Thanh Van Tran, Jack Xin</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting (LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters, which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the full spectrum for forecasting.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20211">What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay, we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern inference architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyoung Kim, Seonguk Park, Junhoo Lee, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore, we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving superior performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230">Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Nagaraj, Deepak Ravikumar, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features) in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities, under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments that confirm such a synergy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ralph Bulanadi, Jawad Chowdhury, Funakubo Hiroshi, Maxim Ziatdinov, Rama Vasudevan, Arpan Biswas, Yongtao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework, INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration), to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery; in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatriz R. Brum, Luiza Lober, Isolde Previdelli, Francisco A. Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression have automated this process. As several methods are available in the literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tetsuro Morimura, Tatsushi Oka, Yugo Suzuki, Daisuke Moriwaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios: one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20275">A Systematic Review on the Generative AI Applications in Human Medical Genomics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Changalidis, Yury Barbitoff, Yulia Nasykhova, Andrey Glotov</p>
<p>Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Xie, Zihao Zhou, Zijian Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC (value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation. Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293">Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Zhang, Rayan Saab</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid. Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank R\"oder, Jan Benad, Manfred Eppe, Pradeep Kr. Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatema Siddika, Md Anwar Hossen, J. Pablo Mu\~noz, Tanya Roosta, Anuj Sharma, Ali Jannesari</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL) remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me (ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> RexCharles Donatus, Kumater Ter, Ore-Ofe Ajayi, Daniel Udekwe</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient, sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soo Hyun Kim, Jang-Hyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations, often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data: WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW) data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zohair Shafi, Serdar Kadioglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abdullah Al Mamun, Ihsen Alouani, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang Su Lee, Vineeth Loganathan, Vijay Raghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20336">Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnson Zhou, Joseph West, Krista A. Ehinger, Zhenming Ren, Sam E. John, David B. Grayden</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals. We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hancheng Min, Ren\'e Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper, we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix. By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to asymmetric matrix factorization problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibang Yang, Xinke Jiang, Rihong Qiu, Ruiqing Li, Yihang Zhang, Yue Fang, Yongxin Xu, Hongxin Ding, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Indupally, Satchit Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase. The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural development and accelerate the design cycle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillaume Guy, Mihajlo Grbovic, Chun How Tan, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images, various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews, making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production, achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Wang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins, enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongpan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency}, \textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Cou\'eraud, Vikram Sunkara, Christof Sch\"utte</p>
<p>Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Widener, Kausik Lakkaraju, John Aydin, Biplav Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences. Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy, transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power, car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben Solozabal, Velibor Bojkovic, Hilal AlQuabeh, Kentaro Inui, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on very large datasets as PathX-256.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Liu, Jian Lou, Yuke Hu, Xiaochen Li, Tailun Chen, Yitian Chen, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering a scalable and robust unlearning solution.</p>

Our benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets, revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their evaluation in realistic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyan Wang, Ye Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihai Zhi, Jiayan Guo, Shangyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Luo, Zangwei Zheng, Ziheng Qin, Zirui Zhu, Yong Liu, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights. Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures. Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2 models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens. This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling faster development and iteration of large language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neta Shoham, Haim Avron</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes (GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tu\u{g}rul Hasan Karabulut, \.Inci M. Bayta\c{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However, gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus, the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on graph and node classification tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debabrota Basu, Sourav Chakraborty, Debarshi Chanda, Buddha Dev Das, Arijit Ghosh, Arnab Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally, this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Immanuel Ro{\ss}teutscher, Klaus S. Drese, Thorsten Uphues</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF) classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borun Shi, Ioannis Panagiotas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinli Shi, Xingxing Yuan, Longkang Zhu, Guanghui Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically, TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyang Wang, Mingtian Zhang, Zijing Ou, David Barber</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced /va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncai He, Xinliang Liu, Jinchao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable, accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Hagmann, Michael Staniek, Stefan Riezler</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles. Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to training on original data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitao Feng, Lixu Wang, Tianyi Wei, Jie Zhang, Chongyang Gao, Sinong Zhan, Peizhuo Lv, Wei Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaocong Wang, Tong Liu, Ming Li, Minjing Yu, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Houliston, Ambroise Odonnat, Charles Arnal, Vivien Cabannes</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored. In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization) for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones. We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Satheesh, Keenan Powell, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.

<p>Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem, converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps: transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and (b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyue Zhang, Lin Song, Erkang Bao, Xiaoling Lv, Xinyue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results, our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06 compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Ramlaoui, Martin Siron, Inel Djafar, Joseph Musielewicz, Amandine Rossello, Victor Schmidt, Alexandre Duval</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Eremeev, Gleb Bazhenov, Oleg Platonov, Artem Babenko, Liudmila Prokhorenkova</p>
<p>Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine B. Adams, Justin J. Boutilier, Qinyang He, Yonatan Mintz</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically. Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral change interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Hassidof, Tom Jurgenson, Kiril Solovey</p>
<p>Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs. DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/ditree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradeep Nanda, Anay Majee, Rishabh Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI) enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21016">Inference-Time Alignment Control for Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luozhijie Jin, Zijie Qiu, Jie Liu, Zijie Diao, Lifeng Qiao, Ning Ding, Alex Lamb, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences, compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering. Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG is publicly available at the Github: https://github.com/jinluo12345/Reinforcement-learning-guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gil Goldshlager, Jiang Hu, Lin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting. Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Yang, Syrine Belakaria, Biresh Kumar Joardar, Huanrui Yang, Janardhan Rao Doppa, Partha Pratim Pande, Krishnendu Chakrabarty, Hai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing. However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance, area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method, referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead, execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost. CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from NSGA-II.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hashim Ali, Surya Subramani, Shefali Sudhir, Raksha Varahamurthy, Hafiz Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy. However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases, such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongwei Liu, Jin Zheng, John Cartlidge</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets. Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Lee, Jihyeong Jeon, Jaemin Hong, U Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol (Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale, (2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3) reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases, achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR across various settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel M. Yellin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs (like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Jiang, Malyaban Bal, Brian Matejek, Susmit Jha, Adam Cobb, Abhronil Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS) mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: CRISPR-based genome editing has revolutionized biotechnology, yet optimizing guide RNA (gRNA) design for efficiency and safety remains a critical challenge. Recent advances (2020--2025, updated to reflect current year if needed) demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, can markedly improve the prediction of gRNA on-target activity and identify off-target risks. In parallel, emerging explainable AI (XAI) techniques are beginning to illuminate the black-box nature of these models, offering insights into sequence features and genomic contexts that drive Cas enzyme performance. Here we review how state-of-the-art machine learning models are enhancing gRNA design for CRISPR systems, highlight strategies for interpreting model predictions, and discuss new developments in off-target prediction and safety assessment. We emphasize breakthroughs from top-tier journals that underscore an interdisciplinary convergence of AI and genome editing to enable more efficient, specific, and clinically viable CRISPR applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation.

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice. To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g., lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more selectively within classical inversion algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phu-Vinh Nguyen, Tan-Hanh Pham, Chris Ngo, Truong Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20236">The Mathematician&#x27;s Assistant: Integrating AI into Research Practice</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Henkel</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting, critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use these powerful tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutahar Safdar, Gentry Wood, Max Zimmermann, Guy Lamouche, Priti Wanjara, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiang Chi, Yanan Wu, Li Gu, Huan Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Yang Zhang, Yang Wang, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyuan Wang, Raffaele Romagnoli, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Yorie Nakahira</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements, which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk quantification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay. We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sopam Dasgupta, Sadaf MD Halim, Joaqu\'in Arias, Elmer Salazar, Gopal Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency -- clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome. Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and `how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost (effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user, resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can generate illegal actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyao Wang, Bowen Liu, Jianheng Tang, Nuo Chen, Yuhan Li, Qifan Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20375">CoFormer: Collaborating with Heterogeneous Edge Devices for Scalable Transformer Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanyu Xu, Zhiwei Hao, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Fuhui Sun, Xiaoyan Wang, Han Hu, Yonggang Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayaka Tsutsumi, Guang Li, Ren Togo, Takahiro Ogawa, Satoshi Kondo, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23 years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9 baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control.

<p>Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattias Cross, Anton Ragni</p>
<p>Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jyoti Narwariya, Priyanka Gupta, Muskan Gupta, Jyotsana Khatri, Lovekesh Vig</p>
<p>Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation: (i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and (iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms of both Recall and MRR metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Caselle, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization, certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the Nambu-Got\"o EST.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \v{S}imon Kucharsk\'y, Aayush Mishra, Daniel Habermann, Stefan T. Radev, Paul-Christian B\"urkner</p>
<p>Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fartash Faghri, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Cem Koc, Vaishaal Shankar, Alexander Toshev, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Piao, Yuan Lu, Hareld Kemps, Tong Xia, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological, respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features, eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89), particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97). Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Bujak, Rafal Kucharski</p>
<p>Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fachri Najm Noer Kartiman,  Rasim, Yaya Wihardi, Nurul Hasanah, Oskar Natan, Bambang Wahono, Taufik Ibnu Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harethah Abu Shairah, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, George Turkiyyah, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Huang, Zhibo Ren, Yipeng Yu, Ying Zhou, Zulong Chen, Zeyi Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3.

<p>Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M (tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a 12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count). OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained. The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch sound'' beginning in 2019.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Himanshu Sharma, Luk\'a\v{s} Nov\'ak, Michael D. Shields</p>
<p>Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore, the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal processing methods.</p>

Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel V. Loureiro, Steven Derby, Aleksei Medvedev, Alejandro Ariza-Casabona, Gonzalo Fiz Pontiveros, Tri Kurniawan Wijaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1) Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains. 2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Li, Boyang Sun, Luca Di Giammarino, Hermann Blum, Marc Pollefeys</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction, and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary 3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints. ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured, semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally, ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing methods on both classification and regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paritosh Parmar, Eric Peh, Basura Fernando</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

<p>Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huynh Tong Dang Khoa, Dang Hoai Nam, Vo Nguyen Le Duy</p>
<p>Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples. Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations. First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second, they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Coscia, Shunan Guo, Eunyee Koh, Alex Endert</p>
<p>Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20 participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable feedback to improve LLM performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Chang, Sk Miraj Ahmed, Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy, Basak Guler, Ananthram Swami, Samet Oymak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: The key premise of federated learning (FL) is to train ML models across a diverse set of data-owners (clients), without exchanging local data. An overarching challenge to this date is client heterogeneity, which may arise not only from variations in data distribution, but also in data quality, as well as compute/communication latency. An integrated view of these diverse and concurrent sources of heterogeneity is critical; for instance, low-latency clients may have poor data quality, and vice versa. In this work, we propose FLASH(Federated Learning Across Simultaneous Heterogeneities), a lightweight and flexible client selection algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art FL frameworks under extensive sources of heterogeneity, by trading-off the statistical information associated with the client's data quality, data distribution, and latency. FLASH is the first method, to our knowledge, for handling all these heterogeneities in a unified manner. To do so, FLASH models the learning dynamics through contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) and dynamically selects the most promising clients. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLASH achieves substantial and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines -- as much as 10% in absolute accuracy -- thanks to its unified approach. Importantly, FLASH also outperforms federated aggregation methods that are designed to handle highly heterogeneous settings and even enjoys a performance boost when integrated with them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Futa Waseda, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training often suffers from a robustness-accuracy trade-off, where achieving high robustness comes at the cost of accuracy. One approach to mitigate this trade-off is leveraging invariance regularization, which encourages model invariance under adversarial perturbations; however, it still leads to accuracy loss. In this work, we closely analyze the challenges of using invariance regularization in adversarial training and understand how to address them. Our analysis identifies two key issues: (1) a ``gradient conflict" between invariance and classification objectives, leading to suboptimal convergence, and (2) the mixture distribution problem arising from diverged distributions between clean and adversarial inputs. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric Representation-regularized Adversarial Training (ARAT), which incorporates asymmetric invariance loss with stop-gradient operation and a predictor to avoid gradient conflict, and a split-BatchNorm (BN) structure to resolve the mixture distribution problem. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that each component effectively addresses the identified issues, offering novel insights into adversarial defense. ARAT shows superiority over existing methods across various settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings to knowledge distillation-based defenses, providing a new perspective on their relative successes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechun Niu, Zhilin Zhang, Jiaxin Mao, Qingyao Ai, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely available, large-scale, real click logs. However, many previous simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited because they may have one or more of the following deficiencies: 1) using a weak production ranker to generate initial ranked lists, 2) relying on a simplified user simulation model to simulate user clicks, and 3) generating a fixed number of synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.
  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use production rankers with different ranking performance, (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions, and (3) generate different numbers of synthetic sessions for the training queries. We find that the IPS-DCM, DLA-PBM, and UPE models show better robustness under various simulation settings than other CLTR models. Moreover, existing CLTR models often fail to outperform naive click baselines when the production ranker is strong and the number of training sessions is limited, indicating a pressing need for new CLTR algorithms tailored to these conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshitaka Inoue, Hunmin Lee, Tianfan Fu, Augustin Luna</p>
<p>Abstract: A challenge in drug response prediction is result interpretation compared to established knowledge. drGT is a graph deep learning model that predicts sensitivity and aids in biomarker identification using attention coefficients (ACs). drGT leverages a heterogeneous graph composed of relationships drawn from drugs, genes, and cell line responses. The model is trained and evaluated using major benchmark datasets: Sanger GDSC, NCI60, and Broad CTRP, which cover a wide range of drugs and cancer cell lines. drGT demonstrates AUROC of up to 94.5% under random splitting, 84.4% for unseen drugs, and 70.6% for unseen cell lines, comparable to existing benchmark methods while also providing interpretability. Regarding interpretability, we review drug-gene co-occurrences by text-mining PubMed abstracts for high-coefficient genes mentioning particular drugs. Across 976 drugs from NCI60 with known drug-target interactions (DTIs), model predictions utilized both known DTIs (36.9%) as well as additional predictive associations, many supported by literature. In addition, we compare the drug-gene associations identified by drGT with those from an established DTI prediction model and find that 63.67% are supported by either PubMed literature or predictions from the DTI model. Further, we describe the utilization of ACs to identify affected biological processes by each drug via enrichment analyses, thereby enhancing biological interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Liu, Yihua Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction have introduced sophisticated training techniques and model architectures. However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods. Our study emphasizes the critical need to update baselines for a more accurate assessment of progress in GNNs for link prediction.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15189">Categorical Data Clustering via Value Order Estimated Distance Metric Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Zhang, Mingjie Zhao, Hong Jia, Yang Lu, Mengke Li, Yiu-ming Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is a popular machine learning technique for data mining that can process and analyze datasets to automatically reveal sample distribution patterns. Since the ubiquitous categorical data naturally lack a well-defined metric space such as the Euclidean distance space of numerical data, the distribution of categorical data is usually under-represented, and thus valuable information can be easily twisted in clustering. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel order distance metric learning approach to intuitively represent categorical attribute values by learning their optimal order relationship and quantifying their distance in a line similar to that of the numerical attributes. Since subjectively created qualitative categorical values involve ambiguity and fuzziness, the order distance metric is learned in the context of clustering. Accordingly, a new joint learning paradigm is developed to alternatively perform clustering and order distance metric learning with low time complexity and a guarantee of convergence. Due to the clustering-friendly order learning mechanism and the homogeneous ordinal nature of the order distance and Euclidean distance, the proposed method achieves superior clustering accuracy on categorical and mixed datasets. More importantly, the learned order distance metric greatly reduces the difficulty of understanding and managing the non-intuitive categorical data. Experiments with ablation studies, significance tests, case studies, etc., have validated the efficacy of the proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yewon Byun, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Saurabh Garg, Emma Strubell, Michael Oberst, Bryan Wilder, Zachary C. Lipton</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world settings, regulations and economic incentives permit the sharing of models but not data across institutional boundaries. In such scenarios, practitioners might hope to adapt models to new domains, without losing performance on previous domains (so-called catastrophic forgetting). While any single model may struggle to achieve this goal, learning an ensemble of domain-specific experts offers the potential to adapt more closely to each individual institution. However, a core challenge in this context is determining which expert to deploy at test time. In this paper, we propose Generate to Discriminate (G2D), a domain-incremental continual learning method that leverages synthetic data to train a domain-discriminator that routes samples at inference time to the appropriate expert. Surprisingly, we find that leveraging synthetic data in this capacity is more effective than using the samples to \textit{directly} train the downstream classifier (the more common approach to leveraging synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature). We observe that G2D outperforms competitive domain-incremental learning methods on tasks in both vision and language modalities, providing a new perspective on the use of synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sof\'ia P\'erez Casulo, Marcelo Fiori, Federico Larroca, Gonzalo Mateos</p>
<p>Abstract: We put forth a principled design of a neural architecture to learn nodal Adjacency Spectral Embeddings (ASE) from graph inputs. By bringing to bear the gradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm unrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph neural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we call the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE), which is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved edges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network (GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations alone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose several refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention in the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable approximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming heavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing libraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its parameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a trainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation learning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns ``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link prediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the latter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral positional encodings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan Lu, Menghao Huo, Yuxiao Li, Qiang Zhu, Zhenrui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is fundamental to enhancing the dynamic performance of modern power grids, especially under high renewable penetration. This paper presents Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), a novel deep learning model designed to provide long-term, high-fidelity forecasts of wind and solar power. Unlike conventional time-series models, CT-PatchTST captures both temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations-features that are critical for effective energy storage planning, control, and dispatch. Reliable forecasting enables proactive deployment of energy storage systems (ESSs), helping to mitigate uncertainties in renewable output, reduce system response time, and optimize storage operation based on location-specific flow and voltage conditions. Evaluated on real-world datasets from Denmark's offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar generation, CT-PatchTST outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness. By enabling predictive, data-driven coordination of ESSs across integrated source-grid-load-storage systems, this work contributes to the design of more stable, responsive, and cost-efficient power networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing machine learning literature lacks graph-based domain adaptation techniques capable of handling large distribution shifts, primarily due to the difficulty in simulating a coherent evolutionary path from source to target graph. To meet this challenge, we present a graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework, which constructs a compact domain sequence that minimizes information loss during adaptation. Our approach starts with an efficient generation of knowledge-preserving intermediate graphs over the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric. A GGDA domain sequence is then constructed upon this bridging data pool through a novel vertex-based progression, which involves selecting "close" vertices and performing adaptive domain advancement to enhance inter-domain transferability. Theoretically, our framework provides implementable upper and lower bounds for the intractable inter-domain Wasserstein distance, $W_p(\mu_t,\mu_{t+1})$, enabling its flexible adjustment for optimal domain formation. Extensive experiments across diverse transfer scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our GGDA framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Duchemin, Guillaume Obozinski</p>
<p>Abstract: The perspective of developing trustworthy AI for critical applications in science and engineering requires machine learning techniques that are capable of estimating their own uncertainty. In the context of regression, instead of estimating a conditional mean, this can be achieved by producing a predictive interval for the output, or to even learn a model of the conditional probability $p(y|x)$ of an output $y$ given input features $x$. While this can be done under parametric assumptions with, e.g. generalized linear model, these are typically too strong, and non-parametric models offer flexible alternatives. In particular, for scalar outputs, learning directly a model of the conditional cumulative distribution function of $y$ given $x$ can lead to more precise probabilistic estimates, and the use of proper scoring rules such as the weighted interval score (WIS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) lead to better coverage and calibration properties.
  This paper introduces novel algorithms for learning probabilistic regression trees for the WIS or CRPS loss functions. These algorithms are made computationally efficient thanks to an appropriate use of known data structures - namely min-max heaps, weight-balanced binary trees and Fenwick trees. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of our methods is competitive with alternative approaches. Additionally, our methods benefit from the inherent interpretability and explainability of trees. As a by-product, we show how our trees can be used in the context of conformal prediction and explain why they are particularly well-suited for achieving group-conditional coverage guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Han Huang, Ni Zhan, Elif Ertekin, Peter Orbanz, Ryan P. Adams</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ans\"atze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rikuto Kotoge, Ziwei Yang, Zheng Chen, Yushun Dong, Yasuko Matsubara, Jimeng Sun, Yasushi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving targeted pathways in biological knowledge bases, particularly when incorporating wet-lab experimental data, remains a challenging task and often requires downstream analyses and specialized expertise. In this paper, we frame this challenge as a solvable graph learning and explaining task and propose a novel subgraph inference framework, ExPAth, that explicitly integrates experimental data to classify various graphs (bio-networks) in biological databases. The links (representing pathways) that contribute more to classification can be considered as targeted pathways. Our framework can seamlessly integrate biological foundation models to encode the experimental molecular data. We propose ML-oriented biological evaluations and a new metric. The experiments involving 301 bio-networks evaluations demonstrate that pathways inferred by ExPath are biologically meaningful, achieving up to 4.5x higher Fidelity+ (necessity) and 14x lower Fidelity- (sufficiency) than explainer baselines, while preserving signaling chains up to 4x longer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengfan Cao, Eunhyek Joa, Francesco Borrelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Guaranteeing constraint satisfaction is challenging in imitation learning (IL), particularly in tasks that require operating near a system's handling limits. Traditional IL methods, such as Behavior Cloning (BC), often struggle to enforce constraints, leading to suboptimal performance in high-precision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach to incorporating safety into the IL objective. Through simulations, we empirically validate our approach on an autonomous racing task with both full-state and image feedback, demonstrating improved constraint satisfaction and greater consistency in task performance compared to BC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Franco, Pablo Monteagudo-Lago, Ian Colbert, Nicholas Fraser, Michaela Blott</p>
<p>Abstract: The size of a model has been a strong predictor of its quality, as well as its cost. As such, the trade-off between model cost and quality has been well-studied. Post-training optimizations like quantization and pruning have typically focused on reducing the overall volume of pre-trained models to reduce inference costs while maintaining model quality. However, recent advancements have introduced optimization techniques that, interestingly, expand models post-training, increasing model size to improve quality when reducing volume. For instance, to enable 4-bit weight and activation quantization, incoherence processing often necessitates inserting online Hadamard rotations in the compute graph, and preserving highly sensitive weights often calls for additional higher precision computations. However, if application requirements cannot be met, the prevailing solution is to relax quantization constraints. In contrast, we demonstrate post-training model expansion is a viable strategy to improve model quality within a quantization co-design space, and provide theoretical justification. We show it is possible to progressively and selectively expand the size of a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to improve model quality without end-to-end retraining. In particular, when quantizing the weights and activations to 4 bits for Llama3 1B, we reduce the gap to full-precision perplexity by an average of 9% relative to both QuaRot and SpinQuant with only 5% more parameters, which is still a 3.8% reduction in volume relative to a BF16 reference model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumar Manas, Christian Schlauch, Adrian Paschke, Christian Wirth, Nadja Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Valerio Miceli-Barone, Vaishak Belle, Ali Payani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging.
  In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.
  We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.
  We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Talha Ersoy, Karoline Wiesner</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing the L2 regularization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causes a first-order phase transition into the under-parametrized phase -- the so-called onset-of learning. We explain this transition via the scalar (Ricci) curvature of the error landscape. We predict new transition points as the data complexity is increased and, in accordance with the theory of phase transitions, the existence of hysteresis effects. We confirm both predictions numerically. Our results provide a natural explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon of '\emph{grokking}' as DNN models getting stuck in a local minimum of the error surface, corresponding to a lower accuracy phase. Our work paves the way for new probing methods of the intrinsic structure of DNNs in and beyond the L2 context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Feng, Chaopeng Wei, Tenghai Qiu, Tianyi Hu, Zhiqiang Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE), a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and promote modularization among the experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of spatial experiments to optimize the amount of information derived from the experimental data and enhance the accuracy of the resulting causal effect estimator. We propose a surrogate function for the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator, which facilitates the use of classical graph cut algorithms to learn the optimal design.

Theoretical results and numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness of our design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuchen Jiao, Yu Huang, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability to perform new tasks at test time using a handful of input-output examples, without parameter updates. We develop a universal approximation theory to elucidate how transformers enable in-context learning. For a general class of functions (each representing a distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any further weight updates, can predict based on a few noisy in-context examples with vanishingly small risk. Unlike prior work that frames transformers as approximators of optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) for statistical learning tasks, we integrate Barron's universal function approximation theory with the algorithm approximator viewpoint. Our approach yields approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness of the optimization algorithms being mimicked, extending far beyond convex problems like linear regression. The key is to show that (i) any target function can be nearly linearly represented, with small $\ell_1$-norm, over a set of universal features, and (ii) a transformer can be constructed to find the linear representation -- akin to solving Lasso -- at test time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqing Liu, Wenqi Fan, Xiaoyong Wei, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights. GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Nam, Jinsung Yoon, Jiefeng Chen, Jinwoo Shin, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 64% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lauren Hyoseo Yoon, Yisong Yue, Been Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) suggests these models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc detection of such alignment and explicitly optimize for it? We argue this challenge is most critical in fine-grained contextual distinctions-where multiple descriptions share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details. We address this with the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. We systematically evaluate JAM across three design axes: (i) alignment objectives, introducing our multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods; (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective; and (iii) the role of foundation model scale in representational convergence. Our findings show that JAM reliably induces alignment even across independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight into the structure of shared semantics and practical guidance for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs. Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijiang Li, Liuya Zhang, Jieting Wang, Tao Yan, Yuhua Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model. Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS) method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling (RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method. Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS, respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.</p>

<p>Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial, task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$, respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinquan Chen, Bangwei Liu, Xuhong Wang, Yingchun Wang, Chaochao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and 50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for PRM training with more efficient data utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Charles A. Emogor, Vincent B\"orsch-Supan, Lily Xu, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL evaluated on real-world, human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals across different domains (i.e., datasets), often leading to poor generalization. This work proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a thorough ablation analysis of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renxuan Tan, Rongpeng Li, Xiaoxue Yu, Xianfu Chen, Xing Xu, Zhifeng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicong Wu, Guangyue Lu, Yuan Zuo, Huarong Zhang, Junjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Ning, Tai Yue Li, Nan Yow Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gary Simethy, Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo, Petar Durdevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Attali, Thomas Papastergiou, Nathalie Pernelle, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afrar Jahin, Yi Pan, Yingfeng Wang, Tianming Liu, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications, striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence models for molecular and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Adam optimizer remains one of the most widely used optimizers in deep learning, and effectively tuning its hyperparameters is key to optimizing performance. However, tuning can be tedious and costly. Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a recent promising approach for low-budget hyperparameter tuning, but is limited by generic surrogates without prior knowledge of how hyperparameters affect learning. We propose Adam-PFN, a new surrogate model for Freeze-thaw BO of Adam's hyperparameters, pre-trained on learning curves from TaskSet, together with a new learning curve augmentation method, CDF-augment, which artificially increases the number of available training examples. Our approach improves both learning curve extrapolation and accelerates hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, with strong performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyue Kong, Yinglong Zhang, Chengda Xu, Xuewen Xia, Xing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning.

<p>Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by humans comprehending speech in a multi-modal manner, various audio-visual datasets have been constructed. However, most existing datasets focus on English, induce dependencies with various prediction models during dataset preparation, and have only a small number of multi-view videos. To mitigate the limitations, we recently developed the Open Large-scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech (OLKAVS) dataset, which is the largest among publicly available audio-visual speech datasets. The dataset contains 1,150 hours of transcribed audio from 1,107 Korean speakers in a studio setup with nine different viewpoints and various noise situations. We also provide the pre-trained baseline models for two tasks, audio-visual speech recognition and lip reading. We conducted experiments based on the models to verify the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-view training over uni-modal and frontal-view-only training. We expect the OLKAVS dataset to facilitate multi-modal research in broader areas such as Korean speech recognition, speaker recognition, pronunciation level classification, and mouth motion analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuying Meng, Chungang Lin, Yequan Wang, Yujun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: All data on the Internet are transferred by network traffic, thus accurately modeling network traffic can help improve network services quality and protect data privacy. Pretrained models for network traffic can utilize large-scale raw data to learn the essential characteristics of network traffic, and generate distinguishable results for input traffic without considering specific downstream tasks. Effective pretrained models can significantly optimize the training efficiency and effectiveness of downstream tasks, such as application classification, attack detection and traffic generation. Despite the great success of pretraining in natural language processing, there is no work in the network field. Considering the diverse demands and characteristics of network traffic and network tasks, it is non-trivial to build a pretrained model for network traffic and we face various challenges, especially the heterogeneous headers and payloads in the multi-pattern network traffic and the different dependencies for contexts of diverse downstream network tasks.
  To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a generative pretrained model NetGPT for both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We propose the multi-pattern network traffic modeling to construct unified text inputs and support both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We further optimize the adaptation effect of the pretrained model to diversified tasks by shuffling header fields, segmenting packets in flows, and incorporating diverse task labels with prompts. With diverse traffic datasets from encrypted software, DNS, private industrial protocols and cryptocurrency mining, expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our NetGPT in a range of traffic understanding and generation tasks on traffic datasets, and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: This study aimed to predict lesion-specific outcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma (MBM), using clinical, dosimetric, and pretherapeutic MRI data. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 517 MBM from 130 patients treated with single-fraction or hypofractionated SRT at three centers were analyzed. From contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, 1576 radiomic features (RF) were extracted per lesion - 788 from the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 788 from a 3 mm peritumoral margin. Clinical, dosimetric and RF data from one center were used for feature selection and model development via nested cross-validation employing an ensemble learning approach; external validation used data from the other two centers. Results: Local failure occurred in 72/517 lesions (13.9%). Predictive models based on clinical data, RF, or a combination of both achieved c-indices of 0.60 +/- 0.15, 0.65 +/- 0.11, and 0.65 +/- 0.12, respectively. RF-based models outperformed the clinical models; dosimetric data alone were not predictive. Most predictive RF originated from the peritumoral margin (92%) versus GTV (76%). On the first external dataset, all models performed similarly (c-index: 0.60-0.63), but generalization was poor on the second (c-index < 0.50), likely due to differences in patient characteristics and imaging protocols. Conclusions: Pretherapeutic MRI features, particularly from the peritumoral region, show promise for predicting lesion-specific outcomes in MBM after SRT. Their consistent contribution suggests biologically relevant information that may support individualized treatment planning. Combined with clinical data, these markers offer prognostic insight, though generalizability remains limited by data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Feng, Jianxiang Feng, Zhaopeng Chen, Rudolph Triebel, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conghan Yue, Zhengwei Peng, Shiyan Du, Zhi Ji, Chuangjian Cai, Le Wan, Dongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm, independent of denoising network architectures, for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate particular features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs.

SoftKI approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from a smaller number of interpolation points learned by optimizing a combination of the SoftKI marginal log-likelihood (MLL), and when needed, an approximate MLL for improved numerical stability. Consequently, it can overcome the dimensionality scaling challenges that SKI faces when interpolating from a dense and static lattice while retaining the flexibility of variational methods to adapt inducing points to the dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftKI across various examples and show that it is competitive with other approximated GP methods when the data dimensionality is modest (around 10).</p>

<p>Abstract: Context: With artificial intelligence (AI) being well established within the daily lives of research communities, we turn our gaze toward formal methods (FM). FM aim to provide sound and verifiable reasoning about problems in computer science. Objective: We conduct a systematic mapping study to overview the current landscape of research publications that apply AI to FM. We aim to identify how FM can benefit from AI techniques and highlight areas for further research. Our focus lies on the previous five years (2019-2023) of research. Method: Following the proposed guidelines for systematic mapping studies, we searched for relevant publications in four major databases, defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and applied extensive snowballing to uncover potential additional sources. Results: This investigation results in 189 entries which we explored to find current trends and highlight research gaps. We find a strong focus on AI in the area of theorem proving while other subfields of FM are less represented. Conclusions: The mapping study provides a quantitative overview of the modern state of AI application in FM. The current trend of the field is yet to mature. Many primary studies focus on practical application, yet we identify a lack of theoretical groundwork, standard benchmarks, or case studies. Further, we identify issues regarding shared training data sets and standard benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Zozoulenko, Thomas Cass, Lukas Gonon</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Superstate Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system itself, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Two options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits are introduced to transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving a quantum inverse problem in a single measurement act (analogous to how an eigenvalue arises from a measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Nazari, Michael Weiss</p>
<p>Abstract: Organizations face growing challenges in deriving meaningful insights from vast amounts of specialized text data. Conventional topic modeling techniques are typically static and unsupervised, making them ill-suited for fast-evolving fields like quantum cryptography. These models lack contextual awareness and cannot easily incorporate emerging expert knowledge or subtle shifts in subdomains. Moreover, they often overlook rare but meaningful terms, limiting their ability to surface early signals or align with expert-driven insights essential for strategic understanding. To tackle these gaps, we employ design science research methodology to create a framework that enhances topic modeling by weighting aspects based on expert-informed input. It combines expert-curated keywords with topic distributions iteratively to improve topic relevance and document alignment accuracy in specialized research areas. The framework comprises four phases, including (1) initial topic modeling, (2) expert aspect definition, (3) supervised document alignment using cosine similarity, and (4) iterative refinement until convergence. Applied to quantum communication research, this method improved the visibility of critical but low-frequency terms. It also enhanced topic coherence and aligned topics with the cryptographic priorities identified by experts. Compared to the baseline model, this framework increased intra-cluster similarity. It reclassified a substantial portion of documents into more thematically accurate clusters. Evaluating QCrypt 2023 and 2024 conference papers showed that the model adapts well to changing discussions, marking a shift from theoretical foundations to implementation challenges. This study illustrates that expert-guided, aspect-weighted topic modeling boosts interpretability and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the observation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse queries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this query diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage grows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wang, Zhipeng Zhang, Baao Xie, Xin Jin, Yunbo Wang, Shiyu Wang, Liaomo Zheng, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, $\textit{i.e.,}$ RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentangled representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruining Li, Chuanxia Zheng, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Most 3D object generators prioritize aesthetic quality, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for practical applications. One such constraint is that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under gravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator directly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset enables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO) - a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is significantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework functions even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek</p>
<p>Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Huang, Ruibin Li, Tong Jia, Wei Zheng, Ya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance. AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/nynu-BDAI/AHNPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoon Hwang, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo, Dongmin Park, Jongho Park</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess-a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kureha Yamaguchi, Benjamin Etheridge, Andy Arditi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Caprio</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model. Its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool, though, has remained conceptually opaque: While Conformal Prediction Regions (CPRs) give an ordinal representation of uncertainty (larger regions typically indicate higher uncertainty), they lack the capability to cardinally quantify it (twice as large regions do not imply twice the uncertainty). We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrey Bryutkin, Matthew E. Levine, I\~nigo Urteaga, Youssef Marzouk</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19861">Quantum-informed machine learning for the prediction of chaotic dynamical systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maida Wang, Xiao Xue, Mingyang Gao, Peter V. Coveney</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning (QIML) framework for the long-term dynamical behavior of high-dimensional chaotic systems. The method combines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical autoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model learns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale interactions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed three-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition. Compared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in predictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of the predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior is essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML produces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine learning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov Neural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a memory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale Q-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical model, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction. Our findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the advantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering modeling and simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Pichler, Yannek K\"aber</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms. Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of the growth process, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojan Deraji\'c, Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi, Sebastian Bernhard, Wolfgang H\"onig</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time. We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties. The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.
