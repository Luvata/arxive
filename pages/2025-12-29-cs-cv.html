<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Gupta, Gurekas Singh Sahney, Hardik Rathi, Abhishek Chandwani, Ishaan Gupta, Pratik Narang, Dhruv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414">A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christina Liu, Alan Q. Wang, Joy Hsu, Jiajun Wu, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nairouz Mrabah, Mohamed Bouguessa, Sihem Sami</p>
<p>Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Lv, Yuhui Zhang, Jiangbo Dai, Hanli Wu, Jiaji Wang, Dawei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Jin, Liang Diao, Qixin Xiao, Yifan Hu, Ziqi Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Haisong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumar Abhishek, Jeremy Kawahara, Ghassan Hamarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suncheng Xiang, Xiaoyang Wang, Junjie Jiang, Hejia Wang, Dahong Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495">Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhe Xie, Buyu Guo, Bolin Li, Shuangyan He, Yanzhen Gu, Qingyan Jiang, Peiliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenshuo Peng, Gongxuan Wang, Tianmeng Yang, Chuanhao Li, Xiaojie Xu, Hui He, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508">Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ashik Khan, Md Nahid Siddique</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512">Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ashik Khan, Arafat Alam Jion</p>
<p>Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puyun Wang, Kaimin Yu, Huayang He, Xianyu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henglin Liu, Huijuan Huang, Jing Wang, Chang Liu, Xiu Li, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Li, Rajesh Gangireddy, Samet Akcay, Wei Cheng, Juhua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21542">Vision Transformers are Circulant Attention Learners</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongchen Han, Tianyu Li, Ziyi Wang, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyun Jo, Donghwan Lee, Eunji Jung, Seong Je Oh, Kyungsu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Unnati Saraswat, Tarun Rao, Namah Gupta, Shweta Swami, Shikhar Sharma, Prateek Narang, Dhruv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Zhou, Shuo Li, Tianyu Chen, Qi Song, Chonghan Gao, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinnosuke Hirano, Yuiga Wada, Kazuki Matsuda, Seitaro Otsuki, Komei Sugiura</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

<p>Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Lang, Rongpei Hong, Ting Zhong, Leiting Chen, Qiang Gao, Fan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bintao He, Yiran Cheng, Hongjia Li, Xiang Gao, Xin Gao, Fa Zhang, Renmin Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongpei Hong, Jian Lang, Ting Zhong, Yong Wang, Fan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21617">CausalFSFG: Rethinking Few-Shot Fine-Grained Visual Categorization from Causal Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen Yang, Jinglin Xu, Yuxin Pen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

<p>Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutiara Shabrina, Nova Kurnia Putri, Jefri Satria Ferdiansyah, Sabita Khansa Dewi, Novanto Yudistira</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks such as visual grounding, segmentation, and captioning. However, their ability to perceive perceptual-level image features remains limited. In this work, we present UniPercept-Bench, a unified framework for perceptual-level image understanding across three key domains: Aesthetics, Quality, Structure and Texture. We establish a hierarchical definition system and construct large-scale datasets to evaluate perceptual-level image understanding. Based on this foundation, we develop a strong baseline UniPercept trained via Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training and Task-Aligned RL, enabling robust generalization across both Visual Rating (VR) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UniPercept outperforms existing MLLMs on perceptual-level image understanding and can serve as a plug-and-play reward model for text-to-image generation. This work defines Perceptual-Level Image Understanding in the era of MLLMs and, through the introduction of a comprehensive benchmark together with a strong baseline, provides a solid foundation for advancing perceptual-level multimodal image understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntian Bo, Tao Zhou, Zechao Li, Haofeng Zhang, Ling Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Motaleb Hossen Manik, Md Zabirul Islam, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Li, Longjun Luo, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Barreiro, Roger Mar\'i, Rafael Redondo, Gloria Haro, Carles Bosch</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Yang, Yuting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Rakibul Islam, Md. Kamrozzaman Bhuiyan, Safwan Muntasir, Arifur Rahman Jawad, Most. Sharmin Sultana Samu</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Zahid Hossain, Most. Sharmin Sultana Samu, Md. Kamrozzaman Bhuiyan, Farhad Uz Zaman, Md. Rakibul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Yin, Chengjian Li, Xiangbo Shu, Meiqi Cao, Rui Yan, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21710">RAPTOR: Real-Time High-Resolution UAV Video Prediction with Efficient Video Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Chen, Zile Guo, Enze Zhu, Peirong Zhang, Xiaoxuan Liu, Lei Wang, Yidan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Xiao, XIndi Zhang, Dechao Meng, Qi Wang, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xindi Zhang, Dechao Meng, Steven Xiao, Qi Wang, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arunkumar V, Firos V M, Senthilkumar S, Gangadharan G R</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21769">BertsWin: Resolving Topological Sparsity in 3D Masked Autoencoders via Component-Balanced Structural Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeny Alves Limarenko, Anastasiia Studenikina</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Yang, Adrian G. Bors</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by fungi or bacteria leading to severe tissue damage and disabilities. It affects poor and rural communities and presents medical challenges and socioeconomic burdens on patients and healthcare systems in endemic regions worldwide. Mycetoma diagnosis is a major challenge in mycetoma management, particularly in low-resource settings where expert pathologists are limited. To address this challenge, this paper presents an overview of the Mycetoma MicroImage: Detect and Classify Challenge (mAIcetoma) which was organized to advance mycetoma diagnosis through AI solutions. mAIcetoma focused on developing automated models for segmenting mycetoma grains and classifying mycetoma types from histopathological images. The challenge attracted the attention of several teams worldwide to participate and five finalist teams fulfilled the challenge objectives. The teams proposed various deep learning architectures for the ultimate goal of this challenge. Mycetoma database (MyData) was provided to participants as a standardized dataset to run the proposed models. Those models were evaluated using evaluation metrics. Results showed that all the models achieved high segmentation accuracy, emphasizing the necessitate of grain detection as a critical step in mycetoma diagnosis. In addition, the top-performing models show a significant performance in classifying mycetoma types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany</p>
<p>Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $\sigma=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengqi He, Xinyu Tian, Xin Shen, Jinhong Ni, Shu Zou, Zhaoyuan Yang, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei Yang, Yibo Ai, Weidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuangxin Zhang, Guangfeng Lin, Enhui Zhao, Kaiyang Liao, Yajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lupiao Hu, Fasheng Wang, Fangmei Chen, Fuming Sun, Haojie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Lei, Hongsong Wang, Xin Geng, Liang Wang, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masayuki Kawarada, Kosuke Yamada, Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos, Naoto Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21861">Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency: CNN Fusion Models for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rafid Islam, Rafsan Jany, Akib Ahmed, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Hu, Xuelin Chen, Xiaodong Cun</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although na\"ively finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansh Srivastava, Akshay Mehra, Pranav Maneriker, Debopam Sanyal, Vishnu Raj, Vijay Kamarshi, Fan Du, Joshua Kimball</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mo Wang, Junfeng Xia, Wenhao Ye, Enyu Liu, Kaining Peng, Jianfeng Feng, Quanying Liu, Hongkai Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchen Deng, Wenhua Wu, Kunzhen Wu, Guangming Wang, Siting Zhu, Shenghai Yuan, Xun Chen, Guole Shen, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments.

Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows.

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Liang, Hailun Xia, Naichuan Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yang, Xiuying Wang, Hao Liu, Guanzhong Gong, Lian-Ming Wu, Yu-Ping Wang, Lisheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.</p>

<p>Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Lotfi, Adam Carter, Thuan Ha, Mohammad Meysami, Kwabena Nketia, Steve Shirtliffe</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dunyuan XU, Xikai Yang, Yaoqian Li, Juzheng Miao, Jinpeng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Lai, JunYan Li, Qiang Cai, Lei Wang, Tao Yan, XiaoKun Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Koebler, Lukas Kuhn, Ingo Thon, Florian Buettner</p>
<p>Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21999">Look Closer! An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Hu, Beibei Li, Jiangwei Xia, Yanjun Qin, Bing Ji, Zhongshi He</p>
<p>Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Mehrotra, Sairam V C Rebbapragada, Mani Hemanth Reddy Bonthu, Vineeth N Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Jiang, Li Wang, Kangyao Huang, Wei Fan, Jinyuan Liu, Shaoyu Liu, Hongwei Duan, Bin Xu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanhuan Yuan, Yang Ping, Zhengqin Xu, Junyi Cao, Shuai Jia, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongmin Zhang, Zhen Sun, Yifan Liao, Wenhan Dong, Xinlei He, Xingshuo Han, Shengmin Xu, Xinyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momir Ad\v{z}emovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Ouyang, Dian Zheng, Xiao-Ming Wu, Jian-Jian Jiang, Kun-Yu Lin, Jingke Meng, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuoshuo Zhang, Yizhen Zhang, Jingjing Fu, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Yujiu Yang, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Assaduzzaman, Nushrat Jahan Oyshi, Eram Mahamud</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate classification of gastrointestinal diseases from endoscopic and histopathological imagery remains a significant challenge in medical diagnostics, mainly due to the vast data volume and subtle variation in inter-class visuals. This study presents a hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model integrates the global contextual reasoning of a Swin Transformer with the local fine-grained feature extraction of a Vision Transformer. The student network was implemented as a compact Tiny-ViT structure that inherits the teacher's semantic and morphological knowledge via soft-label distillation, achieving a balance between efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Two carefully curated Wireless Capsule Endoscopy datasets, encompassing major GI disease classes, were employed to ensure balanced representation and prevent inter-sample bias. The proposed framework achieved remarkable performance with accuracies of 0.9978 and 0.9928 on Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively, and an average AUC of 1.0000, signifying near-perfect discriminative capability. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM, LIME, and Score-CAM confirmed that the model's predictions were grounded in clinically significant tissue regions and pathologically relevant morphological cues, validating the framework's transparency and reliability. The Tiny-ViT demonstrated diagnostic performance with reduced computational complexity comparable to its transformer-based teacher while delivering faster inference, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Overall, the proposed framework provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for AI-assisted GI disease diagnosis, paving the way toward future intelligent endoscopic screening that is compatible with clinical practicality.</p>

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqing He, Jie Xu, Wenyuan Yang, Yonghua Zhu, Guoqiu Wen, Xiaofeng Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become a central tool in deep generative modeling, but standard formulations rely on a single network and a single diffusion schedule to transform a simple prior, typically a standard normal distribution, into the target data distribution. As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuf Brima, Marcellin Atemkeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyi Wu, Zhenyi Wang, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gourav Siddhad, Anurag Singh, Rajkumar Saini, Partha Pratim Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a primary cause of traffic accidents, necessitating the development of real-time, reliable detection systems to ensure road safety. This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload.</p>

<p>Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera or object movement severely degrades image quality and poses challenges for real-time applications such as autonomous driving, UAV perception, and medical imaging. In this paper, a lightweight U-shaped network tailored for real-time deblurring is presented and named RT-Focuser. To balance speed and accuracy, we design three key components: Lightweight Deblurring Block (LD) for edge-aware feature extraction, Multi-Level Integrated Aggregation module (MLIA) for encoder integration, and Cross-source Fusion Block (X-Fuse) for progressive decoder refinement. Trained on a single blurred input, RT-Focuser achieves 30.67 dB PSNR with only 5.85M parameters and 15.76 GMACs. It runs 6ms per frame on GPU and mobile, exceeds 140 FPS on both, showing strong potential for deployment on the edge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungwoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangwen Zhang, Xiaowei Dai, Runnan Chen, Xiaoming Chen, Zeke Zexi Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating physically realistic content in VR often requires complex modeling tools or predefined 3D models, textures, and animations, which present significant barriers for non-expert users. In this paper, we propose SketchPlay, a novel VR interaction framework that transforms humans' air-drawn sketches and gestures into dynamic, physically realistic scenes, making content creation intuitive and playful like drawing. Specifically, sketches capture the structure and spatial arrangement of objects and scenes, while gestures convey physical cues such as velocity, direction, and force that define movement and behavior. By combining these complementary forms of input, SketchPlay captures both the structure and dynamics of user-created content, enabling the generation of a wide range of complex physical phenomena, such as rigid body motion, elastic deformation, and cloth dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional text-driven methods, SketchPlay offers significant advantages in expressiveness, and user experience. By providing an intuitive and engaging creation process, SketchPlay lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailan Lin, Qijie Wei, Kaibin Tian, Ruixiang Zhao, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) essentially trades a model's performance on a source domain for improving its performance on a target domain. To overcome this, Unsupervised Domain Expansion (UDE) has been introduced, which adapts the model to the target domain while preserving its performance in the source domain. In both UDA and UDE, a model tailored to a given domain is assumed to well handle samples from the given domain. We question the assumption by reporting the existence of cross-domain visual ambiguity: Due to the unclear boundary between the two domains, samples from one domain can be visually close to the other domain. Such sorts of samples are typically in the minority in their host domain, so they tend to be overlooked by the domain-specific model, but can be better handled by a model from the other domain. We exploit this finding by proposing Co-Teaching (CT), which is instantiated with knowledge distillation based CT (kdCT) plus mixup based CT (miCT). Specifically, kdCT leverages a dual-teacher architecture to enhance the student network's ability to handle cross-domain ambiguity. Meanwhile, miCT further enhances the generalization ability of the student. Extensive experiments on image classification and driving-scene segmentation show the viability of CT for UDE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirokatsu Kataoka, Sora Takashima, Ryo Hayamizu, Ryosuke Yamada, Kodai Nakashima, Xinyu Zhang, Edgar Josafat Martinez-Noriega, Nakamasa Inoue, Rio Yokota</p>
<p>Abstract: In the present work, we show that the performance of formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) can match or even exceed that of ImageNet-21k and can approach that of the JFT-300M dataset without the use of real images, human supervision, or self-supervision during the pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs). For example, ViT-Base pre-trained on ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M showed 83.0 and 84.1% top-1 accuracy when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, and FDSL showed 83.8% top-1 accuracy when pre-trained under comparable conditions (hyperparameters and number of epochs). Especially, the ExFractalDB-21k pre-training was calculated with x14.2 fewer images compared with JFT-300M. Images generated by formulas avoid privacy and copyright issues, labeling costs and errors, and biases that real images suffer from, and thus have tremendous potential for pre-training general models. To understand the performance of the synthetic images, we tested two hypotheses, namely (i) object contours are what matter in FDSL datasets and (ii) an increased number of parameters for label creation improves performance in FDSL pre-training. To test the former hypothesis, we constructed a dataset that consisted of simple object contour combinations. We found that this dataset matched the performance of fractal databases. For the latter hypothesis, we found that increasing the difficulty of the pre-training task generally leads to better fine-tuning accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Zhang, Lilang Lin, Shuai Yang, Jiaying Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn meaningful prior representations from unlabeled data, has been proven effective for skeleton-based action understanding. Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension, presenting new challenges for spatial-temporal motion pretext task design. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL, achieving remarkable progress. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Remarkably, our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates versatile representation learning objectives of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for multiple skeleton downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate our method achieves superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motor imitation impairments are commonly reported in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs), suggesting that motor imitation could be used as a phenotype for addressing autism heterogeneity. Traditional methods for assessing motor imitation are subjective, labor-intensive, and require extensive human training. Modern Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) methods, such as CAMI-3D for motion capture data and CAMI-2D for video data, are less subjective. However, they rely on labor-intensive data normalization and cleaning techniques, and human annotations for algorithm training. To address these challenges, we propose CAMI-2DNet, a scalable and interpretable deep learning-based approach to motor imitation assessment in video data, which eliminates the need for data normalization, cleaning and annotation. CAMI-2DNet uses an encoder-decoder architecture to map a video to a motion encoding that is disentangled from nuisance factors such as body shape and camera views. To learn a disentangled representation, we employ synthetic data generated by motion retargeting of virtual characters through the reshuffling of motion, body shape, and camera views, as well as real participant data. To automatically assess how well an individual imitates an actor, we compute a similarity score between their motion encodings, and use it to discriminate individuals with ASCs from neurotypical (NT) individuals. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that CAMI-2DNet has a strong correlation with human scores while outperforming CAMI-2D in discriminating ASC vs NT children. Moreover, CAMI-2DNet performs comparably to CAMI-3D while offering greater practicality by operating directly on video data and without the need for ad-hoc data normalization and human annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The spread of deepfakes poses significant security concerns, demanding reliable detection methods. However, diverse generation techniques and class imbalance in datasets create challenges. We propose CAE-Net, a Convolution- and Attention-based weighted Ensemble network combining spatial and frequency-domain features for effective deepfake detection. The architecture integrates EfficientNet, Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and ConvNeXt with wavelet features to learn complementary representations. We evaluated CAE-Net on the diverse IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2025 (DF-Wild Cup) dataset, which has a 5:1 fake-to-real class imbalance. To address this, we introduce a multistage disjoint-subset training strategy, sequentially training the model on non-overlapping subsets of the fake class while retaining knowledge across stages. Our approach achieved $94.46\%$ accuracy and a $97.60\%$ AUC, outperforming conventional class-balancing methods. Visualizations confirm the network focuses on meaningful facial regions, and our ensemble design demonstrates robustness against adversarial attacks, positioning CAE-Net as a dependable and generalized deepfake detection framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengshi Qi, Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Xianlin Zhang, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the action localization task. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Evidence multimodal reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level, we design a Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoE text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3, THUMOS14 and our newly collected Human-related Anomaly Localization Dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wang, Xuanyu Yi, Qingshan Xu, Yuan Zhou, Long Chen, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However, these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liao, Ugochukwu Ejike Akpudo, Jue Zhang, Yongsheng Gao, Jun Zhou, Wenyi Zeng, Weichuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g., Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JianChao Zhao, Chenhao Ding, Songlin Dong, Jiangyang Li, Qiang Wang, Yuhang He, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task, aiming to enable an agent to continuously adapt to evolving target domains while retaining previously acquired domain knowledge for effective reuse when those domains reappear. Existing shared-parameter paradigms struggle to balance adaptation and forgetting, leading to decreased efficiency and stability. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware shared and self-adaptive expert framework, consisting of two key components: (i) a dual-branch expert architecture that extracts general features and dynamically models domain-specific representations, effectively reducing cross-domain interference and repetitive learning cost; and (ii) an online Frequency-aware Domain Discriminator (FDD), which leverages the robustness of low-frequency image signals for online domain shift detection, guiding dynamic allocation of expert resources for more stable and realistic adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a Continual Repeated Shifts (CRS) benchmark to simulate periodic domain changes for more realistic evaluation. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks under standard and CRS settings, with ablations and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Liu, Zikun Chen, Ruowei Jiang, Ziyi Wu, Kejia Yin, Han Zhao, Parham Aarabi, Igor Gilitschenski</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Wang, Isabella Bennett, Henry Scott, Liang Zhang, Mei Chen, Hao Li, Rui Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating its practical utility for digital content creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> L'ea Dubois, Klaus Schmidt, Chengyu Wang, Ji-Hoon Park, Lin Wang, Santiago Munoz</p>
<p>Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingkun Zhu, Haote Zhang, Lipeng Gu, Wuzhou Quan, Fu Lee Wang, Honghui Fan, Jiali Tang, Haoran Xie, Xiaoping Zhang, Mingqiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal misalignments, such as spatial offsets, resolution discrepancies, and semantic deficiencies, frequently occur in visible-infrared object detection (VI-OD). To mitigate this, existing methods are typically adapted into an alignment-based fusion paradigm, in which an explicit pixel- or feature-level alignment module is inserted before cross-modal fusion. However, pixel-level alignment struggles to cope with severe or mixed misalignments, whereas feature-level alignment often introduces undesirable noise into fused representations under such conditions, ultimately limiting detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free network (AlignFreeNet) for VI-OD. Differing from prior methods, AlignFreeNet abandons any explicit alignment and instead adopts an alignment-free fusion paradigm. Specifically, AlignFreeNet comprises two core modules: variation-guided cross-modal compensation (VCC) and frequency-guided cross-modal fusion (FCF). VCC adaptively feeds the compensated information derived from cross-modal discrepancies back into each modality, enhancing visible and infrared representations without the noise caused by explicit alignment. FCF achieves robust cross-modal fusion by suppressing task-irrelevant redundancy via frequency-domain gating, effectively mitigating noise introduced in the process. Moreover, VCC and FCF jointly exploit low- and high-frequency cues to preserve foreground contours in fused representations, effectively mitigating cross-modal blending caused by severe mixed misalignments. Extensive evaluations on DVTOD, M3FD, and DroneVehicle demonstrate that our AlignFreeNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under severe mixed misalignment conditions, highlighting its robustness and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangquan Chen, Ruihui Zhao, Chuwei Luo, Mingze Sun, Xinlei Yu, Yangyang Kang, Ruqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hosam Elgendy, Ahmed Sharshar, Ahmed Aboeitta, Mohsen Guizani</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from remote sensing imagery is vital for climate resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across 62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g., temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 for stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERTF1 0.902) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenfan Qu, Yiwu Zhong, Huiguo He, Bin Li, Lianwen Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Images manipulated by image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing manipulated image regions remains challenging due to the severe scarcity of high-quality annotated data, which is laborious to create. To address this, we propose a novel approach that mitigates data scarcity by leveraging readily available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.Specifically, we introduce CAAAv2, a novel auto-annotation framework that operates on a category-aware, prior-feature-denoising paradigm that notably reduces task complexity. To further ensure annotation reliability, we propose QES, a novel metric that filters out low-quality annotations. Combining CAAAv2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120 times larger than existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop Web-IML, a new model designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for the task of image manipulation localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, our Web-IML achieves a striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art SparseViT by 21.6 average IoU points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Cheng, Bing Ma, Xuhua Ren, Hongyi Henry Jin, Kai Yu, Peng Zhang, Wenyue Li, Yuan Zhou, Tianxiang Zheng, Qinglin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video diffusion generation suffers from critical sampling efficiency bottlenecks, particularly for large-scale models and long contexts. Existing video acceleration methods, adapted from image-based techniques, lack a single-step distillation ability for large-scale video models and task generalization for conditional downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose the Video Phased Adversarial Equilibrium (V-PAE), a distillation framework that enables high-quality, single-step video generation from large-scale video models. Our approach employs a two-phase process. (i) Stability priming is a warm-up process to align the distributions of real and generated videos. It improves the stability of single-step adversarial distillation in the following process. (ii) Unified adversarial equilibrium is a flexible self-adversarial process that reuses generator parameters for the discriminator backbone. It achieves a co-evolutionary adversarial equilibrium in the Gaussian noise space. For the conditional tasks, we primarily preserve video-image subject consistency, which is caused by semantic degradation and conditional frame collapse during the distillation training in image-to-video (I2V) generation. Comprehensive experiments on VBench-I2V demonstrate that V-PAE outperforms existing acceleration methods by an average of 5.8% in the overall quality score, including semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality. In addition, our approach reduces the diffusion latency of the large-scale video model (e.g., Wan2.1-I2V-14B) by 100 times, while preserving competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Xu, Xiang Wang, Yifei Yu, Wentian Gan, Luca Morelli, Giulio Perda, Xin Wang, Zongqian Zhan, Fabio Remondino</p>
<p>Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM), a 2D objective representation of the Earth's surface, is an essential geospatial product widely used in urban management, city planning, land surveying, and related applications. However, traditional TDOM generation typically relies on a complex offline photogrammetric pipeline, leading to substantial latency and making it unsuitable for time-critical or real-time scenarios. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may deteriorate due to inaccurate camera poses, imperfect Digital Surface Model (DSM), and incorrect occlusions detection. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a near real-time TDOM generation method built upon On-the-Fly 3DGS (3D Gaussian Splatting) optimization. As each incoming image arrives, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via On-the-Fly SfM. Newly observed regions are then incrementally reconstructed as additional 3D Gaussians are inserted using a Delaunay triangulated Gaussian sampling and integration and are further optimized via adaptive training iterations and learning rate, especially in previously unseen or coarsely modeled areas. With orthogonal splatting integrated into the rendering pipeline, A-TDOM can actively produce updated TDOM outputs immediately after each 3DGS update. Code is now available at https://github.com/xywjohn/A-TDOM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijin Zeng, Xuan Lu, Yurong Zhang, Qiangqiang Shen, Guoqing Chao, Li Jiang, Yongyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S M A Sharif, Abdur Rehman, Fayaz Ali Dharejo, Radu Timofte, Rizwan Ali Naqvi</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiafeng Man, Zhipeng Wei, Jingjing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain imaging analysis is crucial for diagnosing and treating brain disorders, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly supporting it. However, current brain imaging visual question-answering (VQA) benchmarks either cover a limited number of imaging modalities or are restricted to coarse-grained pathological descriptions, hindering a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs across the full clinical continuum. To address these, we introduce OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal VQA benchmark specifically designed to assess the multimodal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs in brain imaging analysis with closed- and open-ended evaluations. OmniBrainBench comprises 15 distinct brain imaging modalities collected from 30 verified medical sources, yielding 9,527 validated VQA pairs and 31,706 images. It simulates clinical workflows and encompasses 15 multi-stage clinical tasks rigorously validated by a professional radiologist. Evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source general-purpose, medical, and proprietary MLLMs, highlight the substantial challenges posed by OmniBrainBench. Experiments reveal that proprietary MLLMs like GPT-5 (63.37%) outperform others yet lag far behind physicians (91.35%), while medical ones show wide variance in closed- and open-ended VQA. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs generally trail but excel in specific tasks, and all ones fall short in complex preoperative reasoning, revealing a critical visual-to-clinical gap. OmniBrainBench establishes a new standard to assess MLLMs in brain imaging analysis, highlighting the gaps against physicians. We publicly release our benchmark at link.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daisuke Yasui, Toshitaka Matsuki, Hiroshi Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet are widely used as feature extractors to construct high-accuracy classification models from scarce data for specific tasks. In such scenarios, fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN is difficult due to data scarcity, necessitating the use of fixed weights. However, when the weights are kept fixed, many filters that do not contribute to the target task remain in the model, leading to unnecessary redundancy and reduced efficiency. Therefore, effective methods are needed to reduce model size by pruning filters that are unnecessary for inference. To address this, approaches utilizing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) have been proposed. LRP quantifies the contribution of each filter to the inference result, enabling the pruning of filters with low relevance. However, existing LRP-based pruning methods have been observed to cause cascading accuracy degradation. In this study, we propose an LRP-based dynamic pruning method that suppresses this cascading accuracy degradation and compresses the pre-trained model while preserving task-specific performance in a small-data environment. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the cascading accuracy degradation and achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing LRP-based pruning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timur Mamedov, Anton Konushin, Vadim Konushin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Zheng, Nan Pu, Wenjing Li, Teng Long, Nicu Sebe, Zhun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of synthetic facial imagery has intensified the need for robust Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to attribute both known and unknown forgeries using labeled data for known types and unlabeled data containing a mixture of known and novel types. However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Huang, Hang Hua, Zhuoran Yu, Trevor Darrell, Rogerio Feris, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: While Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks, their choice of vision encoders presents a fundamental weakness: their low-level features lack the robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Foo, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering object-centric representations from images can significantly enhance the robustness, sample efficiency and generalizability of vision models. Works on images with multi-part objects typically follow an implicit object representation approach, which fail to recognize these learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts. This is due to the assumption that object part-whole relations are implicitly encoded into the representations through indirect training objectives. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts. We also show that the discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in a downstream task, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the field of object-centric representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for curvature regularization by penalizing normal curvatures from multiple directions. This total normal curvature regularization is capable of producing solutions with sharp edges and precise isotropic properties. To tackle the resulting high-order nonlinear optimization problem, we reformulate it as the task of finding the steady-state solution of a time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) system. Time discretization is achieved through operator splitting, where each subproblem at the fractional steps either has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved using advanced algorithms. Our method circumvents the need for complex parameter tuning and demonstrates robustness to parameter choices. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach have been rigorously validated in the context of surface and image smoothing problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Zhang, Chunli Li, Jiacheng Hao, Yuan Gao, Danyang Tu, Jianyi Qiao, Xiaoli Yin, Le Lu, Ling Zhang, Ke Yan, Yang Hou, Yu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Esophageal varices (EV) represent a critical complication of portal hypertension, affecting approximately 60% of cirrhosis patients with a significant bleeding risk of ~30%. While traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopy, non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) presents a potential non-invasive alternative that has yet to be fully utilized in clinical practice. We present Multi-Organ-COhesion Network++ (MOON++), a novel multimodal framework that enhances EV assessment through comprehensive analysis of NCCT scans. Inspired by clinical evidence correlating organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity, MOON++ synthesizes imaging characteristics of the esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning. We evaluated our approach using 1,631 patients, those with endoscopically confirmed EV were classified into four severity grades. Validation in 239 patient cases and independent testing in 289 cases demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional single organ methods, achieving an AUC of 0.894 versus 0.803 for the severe grade EV classification (G3 versus <G3) and 0.921 versus 0.793 for the differentiation of moderate to severe grades (>=G2 versus <G2). We conducted a reader study involving experienced radiologists to further validate the performance of MOON++. To our knowledge, MOON++ represents the first comprehensive multi-organ NCCT analysis framework incorporating clinical knowledge priors for EV assessment, potentially offering a promising non-invasive diagnostic alternative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evelyn Zhang, Fufu Yu, Aoqi Wu, Zichen Wen, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Biqing Qi, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing long visual token sequences poses a significant computational burden on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2Pruner has exceptional efficiency and fidelity. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding tasks, it reduces FLOPs by 74.2\% while retaining 99.2\% of its original performance. Furthermore, in challenging localization benchmarks with InternVL-2.5-8B, it maintains 85.7\% performance at a 90\% token reduction rate, marking a significant advancement with up to 63. 53\% improvement over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binfeng Wang, Di Wang, Haonan Guo, Ying Fu, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhong Bai, Xiaoshi Wu, Xintao Wang, Xiao Fu, Yuanxing Zhang, Qinghe Wang, Xiaoyu Shi, Menghan Xia, Zuozhu Liu, Haoji Hu, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reeshad Khan, John Gauch</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengnan Sun, Zhaotai Shi, Jiayin Chen, Qingtao Liu, Yu Cui, Qi Ye, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual dexterous manipulation remains significant challenges in robotics due to the high DoFs of each hand and their coordination. Existing single-hand manipulation techniques often leverage human demonstrations to guide RL methods but fail to generalize to complex bimanual tasks involving multiple sub-skills. In this paper, we introduce VTAO-BiManip, a novel framework that combines visual-tactile-action pretraining with object understanding to facilitate curriculum RL to enable human-like bimanual manipulation. We improve prior learning by incorporating hand motion data, providing more effective guidance for dual-hand coordination than binary tactile feedback. Our pretraining model predicts future actions as well as object pose and size using masked multimodal inputs, facilitating cross-modal regularization. To address the multi-skill learning challenge, we introduce a two-stage curriculum RL approach to stabilize training. We evaluate our method on a bottle-cap unscrewing task, demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach achieves a success rate that surpasses existing visual-tactile pretraining methods by over 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Bonilla-Ormachea, Horacio Cuizaga, Edwin Salcedo, Sebastian Castro, Sergio Fernandez-Testa, Misael Mamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of forest fires is crucial to minimizing the environmental and socioeconomic damage they cause. Indeed, a fire's duration directly correlates with the difficulty and cost of extinguishing it. For instance, a fire burning for 1 minute might require 1 liter of water to extinguish, while a 2-minute fire could demand 100 liters, and a 10-minute fire might necessitate 1,000 liters. On the other hand, existing fire detection systems based on novel technologies (e.g., remote sensing, PTZ cameras, UAVs) are often expensive and require human intervention, making continuous monitoring of large areas impractical. To address this challenge, this work proposes a low-cost forest fire detection system that utilizes a central gateway device with computer vision capabilities to monitor a 360{\deg} field of view for smoke at long distances. A deep reinforcement learning agent enhances surveillance by dynamically controlling the camera's orientation, leveraging real-time sensor data (smoke levels, ambient temperature, and humidity) from distributed IoT devices. This approach enables automated wildfire monitoring across expansive areas while reducing false positives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoya Lu, Dongrui Liu, Yi Yu, Luxin Xu, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations. Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones. Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability. Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training. Please see our code at: https://github.com/AI45Lab/X-Boundary.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamyar Barakati, Yu Liu, Utkarsh Pratiush, Boris N. Slautin, Sergei V. Kalinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nesryne Mejri, Enjie Ghorbel, Anis Kacem, Pavel Chernakov, Niki Foteinopoulou, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Bimber, Karl Dietrich von Ellenrieder, Michael Haller, Rakesh John Amala Arokia Nathan, Gianni Lunardi, Mohamed Youssef, Marco Camurri, Santos Miguel Orozco Soto, Jeremy E. Niven</p>
<p>Abstract: Occlusion from obstacles, such as foliage, can severely obstruct a robot's sensors, impairing scene understanding. We show that "peering", a characteristic side-to-side movement used by insects to overcome their visual limitations, can also allow robots to markedly improve visual reasoning under partial occlusion. This is accomplished by applying core signal processing principles, specifically optical synthetic aperture sensing, together with the vision reasoning capabilities of modern large multimodal models. Peering enables real-time, high-resolution, and wavelength-independent perception, which is crucial for vision-based scene understanding across a wide range of applications. The approach is low-cost and immediately deployable on any camera-equipped robot. We investigated different peering motions and occlusion masking strategies, demonstrating that, unlike peering, state-of-the-art multi-view 3D vision techniques fail in these conditions due to their high susceptibility to occlusion. Robots that see through occlusion will gain superior perception abilities - including enhanced scene understanding, situational awareness, camouflage breaking, and advanced navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyrus Vachha, Yixiao Kang, Zach Dive, Ashwat Chidambaram, Anik Gupta, Eunice Jun, Bjoern Hartmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Authoring 3D scenes is a central task for spatial computing applications. Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YuChe Hsu, AnJui Wang, TsaiChing Ni, YuanFu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21220">RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Xiao Yang, Quanchen Zou, Zhenfei Yin, Tianlin Li, Jian Yang, Yaodong Yang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>
