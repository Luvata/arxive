<p><b>Authors:</b> Younghwan Lee, Tung M. Luu, Donghoon Lee, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), learning from fixed datasets presents a promising solution for domains where real-time interaction with the environment is expensive or risky. However, designing dense reward signals for offline dataset requires significant human effort and domain expertise. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an alternative, but it remains costly due to the human-in-the-loop process, prompting interest in automated reward generation models. To address this, we propose Reward Generation via Large Vision-Language Models (RG-VLM), which leverages the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs to generate rewards from offline data without human involvement. RG-VLM improves generalization in long-horizon tasks and can be seamlessly integrated with the sparse reward signals to enhance task performance, demonstrating its potential as an auxiliary reward signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Beerens, Desmond J. Higham</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new attack paradigm that embeds hidden adversarial capabilities directly into diffusion models via fine-tuning, without altering their observable behavior or requiring modifications during inference. Unlike prior approaches that target specific images or adjust the generation process to produce adversarial outputs, our method integrates adversarial functionality into the model itself. The resulting tampered model generates high-quality images indistinguishable from those of the original, yet these images cause misclassification in downstream classifiers at a high rate. The misclassification can be targeted to specific output classes. Users can employ this compromised model unaware of its embedded adversarial nature, as it functions identically to a standard diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our approach, uncovering a covert attack vector that raises new security concerns. These findings expose a risk arising from the use of externally-supplied models and highlight the urgent need for robust model verification and defense mechanisms against hidden threats in generative models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08801">Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer: A Novel Alternative to Self-Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kiruluta, Priscilla Burity, Samantha Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer architectures, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art results across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks by effectively modeling long-range dependencies. However, the computational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input sequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long sequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale Haar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution properties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and global context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including scale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing the model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present the detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and its integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an architectural diagram. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a standard machine translation benchmark (WMT16 En-De), comparing the LMWT against a baseline self-attention transformer using metrics like BLEU score, perplexity, and token accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity, highlighting the linear scaling of our approach, discuss its novelty in the context of related work, and explore the interpretability offered by visualizing the learned Haar coefficients. Our results indicate that the LMWT achieves competitive performance while offering substantial computational advantages, positioning it as a promising and novel alternative for efficient sequence modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R. Johnson, Smita Krishnaswamy, Michael Perlmutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion wavelets extract information from graph signals at different scales of resolution by utilizing graph diffusion operators raised to various powers, known as diffusion scales. Traditionally, the diffusion scales are chosen to be dyadic integers, $\mathbf{2^j}$. Here, we propose a novel, unsupervised method for selecting the diffusion scales based on ideas from information theory. We then show that our method can be incorporated into wavelet-based GNNs via graph classification experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08803">A temporal scale transformer framework for precise remaining useful life prediction in fuel cells</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezhi Tang, Xiaoyu Chen, Xin Jin, Benyuan Zhang, Wenyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In exploring Predictive Health Management (PHM) strategies for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), the Transformer model, widely used in data-driven approaches, excels in many fields but struggles with time series analysis due to its self-attention mechanism, which yields a complexity of the input sequence squared and low computational efficiency. It also faces challenges in capturing both global long-term dependencies and local details effectively. To tackle this, we propose the Temporal Scale Transformer (TSTransformer), an enhanced version of the inverted Transformer (iTransformer). Unlike traditional Transformers that treat each timestep as an input token, TSTransformer maps sequences of varying lengths into tokens at different stages for inter-sequence modeling, using attention to capture multivariate correlations and feed-forward networks (FFN) to encode sequence representations. By integrating a one-dimensional convolutional layer into the multivariate attention for multi-level scaling of K and V matrices, it improves local feature extraction, captures temporal scale characteristics, and reduces token count and computational costs. Experiments comparing TSTransformer with models like Long Short-Term Memory, iTransformer, and Transformer demonstrate its potential as a powerful tool for advancing PHM in renewable energy, effectively addressing the limitations of pure Transformer models in data-driven time series tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08809">Decoupling Contrastive Decoding: Robust Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Xin Yan, Bin Wen, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex multimodal understanding tasks, they still suffer from the notorious hallucination issue: generating outputs misaligned with obvious visual or factual evidence. Currently, training-based solutions, like direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to suppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning capabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free solutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the estimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted perturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic hallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and realize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning performance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding (DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative samples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image projections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real hallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the contrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood displacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without handcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks and general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it matches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities and outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyuan Lai, Yingming Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex chemical space and limited knowledge scope with biases holds immense challenge for human scientists, yet in automated materials discovery. Existing intelligent methods relies more on numerical computation, leading to inefficient exploration and results with hard-interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principles-guided material discovery system powered by language inferential multi-agent system (MAS), namely PriM. Our framework integrates automated hypothesis generation with experimental validation in a roundtable system of MAS, enabling systematic exploration while maintaining scientific rigor. Based on our framework, the case study of nano helix demonstrates higher materials exploration rate and property value while providing transparent reasoning pathways. This approach develops an automated-and-transparent paradigm for material discovery, with broad implications for rational design of functional materials.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08811">Analogical Learning for Cross-Scenario Generalization: Framework and Application to Intelligent Localization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ziqing Xing, Ridong Li, Zhaohui Yang, Richeng Jin, Chongwen Huang, Yuzhi Yang, M\'erouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is mainly due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite the data of each scenario has its distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows the same underlying physical rule. Based on these findings, this article proposes a brand-new universal deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which provides a highly efficient way to implicitly retrieve the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy across scenarios. Specifically, an elegant bipartite neural network architecture called Mateformer is designed, the first part of which calculates the relativity within multiple feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the current scenario, while the second part uses these relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments show that AL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, stable transferability and robust adaptation to new scenarios without any tuning, and outperforming conventional methods with a precision improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David O. Johnston, Arkajyoti Chakraborty, Nora Belrose</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs grow in capability, the task of supervising LLMs becomes more challenging. Supervision failures can occur if LLMs are sensitive to factors that supervisors are unaware of. We investigate Mechanistic Anomaly Detection (MAD) as a technique to augment supervision of capable models; we use internal model features to identify anomalous training signals so they can be investigated or discarded. We train detectors to flag points from the test environment that differ substantially from the training environment, and experiment with a large variety of detector features and scoring rules to detect anomalies in a set of ``quirky'' language models. We find that detectors can achieve high discrimination on some tasks, but no detector is effective across all models and tasks. MAD techniques may be effective in low-stakes applications, but advances in both detection and evaluation are likely needed if they are to be used in high stakes settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Fang, Yukai Wang, Ruipeng Wang, Zijun Yao, Kun Wang, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) -- enhanced versions of multimodal language models (MLLMs) equipped with reasoning capabilities -- has revolutionized diverse applications. However, their safety implications remain underexplored. While prior work has exposed critical vulnerabilities in unimodal reasoning models, MLRMs introduce distinct risks from cross-modal reasoning pathways. This work presents the first systematic safety analysis of MLRMs through large-scale empirical studies comparing MLRMs with their base MLLMs. Our experiments reveal three critical findings: (1) The Reasoning Tax: Acquiring reasoning capabilities catastrophically degrades inherited safety alignment. MLRMs exhibit 37.44% higher jailbreaking success rates than base MLLMs under adversarial attacks. (2) Safety Blind Spots: While safety degradation is pervasive, certain scenarios (e.g., Illegal Activity) suffer 25 times higher attack rates -- far exceeding the average 3.4 times increase, revealing scenario-specific vulnerabilities with alarming cross-model and datasets consistency. (3) Emergent Self-Correction: Despite tight reasoning-answer safety coupling, MLRMs demonstrate nascent self-correction -- 16.9% of jailbroken reasoning steps are overridden by safe answers, hinting at intrinsic safeguards. These findings underscore the urgency of scenario-aware safety auditing and mechanisms to amplify MLRMs' self-correction potential. To catalyze research, we open-source OpenSafeMLRM, the first toolkit for MLRM safety evaluation, providing unified interface for mainstream models, datasets, and jailbreaking methods. Our work calls for immediate efforts to harden reasoning-augmented AI, ensuring its transformative potential aligns with ethical safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Liu, Hongchang Huang, Bo Yang, Mingxuan Cai, Xu Yang, Xinping Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Blending green hydrogen into natural gas presents a promising approach for renewable energy integration and fuel decarbonization. Accurate estimation of hydrogen fraction in hydrogen-enriched natural gas (HENG) pipeline networks is crucial for operational safety and efficiency, yet it remains challenging due to complex dynamics. While existing data-driven approaches adopt end-to-end architectures for HENG flow state estimation, their limited adaptability to varying operational conditions hinders practical applications. To this end, this study proposes a graph-enhanced DeepONet framework for the real-time estimation of HENG flow, especially hydrogen fractions. First, a dual-network architecture, called branch network and trunk network, is employed to characterize operational conditions and sparse sensor measurements to estimate the HENG state at targeted locations and time points. Second, a graph-enhance branch network is proposed to incorporate pipeline topology, improving the estimation accuracy in large-scale pipeline networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior estimation accuracy for HCNG flow under varying operational conditions compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08818">From Text to Time? Rethinking the Effectiveness of the Large Language Model for Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Shanshan Feng, Xutao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as the backbone for time series prediction has recently gained significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of LLM backbones in this domain remains a topic of debate. Based on thorough empirical analyses, we observe that training and testing LLM-based models on small datasets often leads to the Encoder and Decoder becoming overly adapted to the dataset, thereby obscuring the true predictive capabilities of the LLM backbone. To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs in time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with identical architectures but different pre-training strategies. Thereby, large-scale pre-training allows us to create unbiased Encoder and Decoder components tailored to the LLM backbone. Through controlled experiments, we evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot prediction performance of the LLM, offering insights into its capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that although the LLM backbone demonstrates some promise, its forecasting performance is limited.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821">Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Enming Zhang, Zheng Liu, Yu Xiang, Yanwen Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobing Yu, Jin Yang, Xiao Wu, Peijie Qiu, Xiaofeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: How to adapt a pre-trained model continuously for sequential tasks with different prediction class labels and domains and finally learn a generalizable model across diverse tasks is a long-lasting challenge. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models (e.g., Transformers) for sequential tasks. While many existing CL methods incrementally store additional learned structures, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters or prompts and sometimes even preserve features from previous samples to maintain performance. This leads to unsustainable parameter growth and escalating storage costs as the number of tasks increases. Moreover, current approaches often lack task similarity awareness, which further hinders the models ability to effectively adapt to new tasks without interfering with previously acquired knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose FM-LoRA, a novel and efficient low-rank adaptation method that integrates both a dynamic rank selector (DRS) and dynamic meta-prompting (DMP). This framework allocates model capacity more effectively across tasks by leveraging a shared low-rank subspace critical for preserving knowledge, thereby avoiding continual parameter expansion. Extensive experiments on various CL benchmarks, including ImageNet-R, CIFAR100, and CUB200 for class-incremental learning (CIL), and DomainNet for domain-incremental learning (DIL), with Transformers backbone demonstrate that FM-LoRA effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while delivering robust performance across a diverse range of tasks and domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08824">ColonScopeX: Leveraging Explainable Expert Systems with Multimodal Data for Improved Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalia Sikora, Robert L. Manschke, Alethea M. Tang, Peter Dunstan, Dean A. Harris, Su Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most prevalent malignant tumour worldwide. Early detection of CRC remains problematic due to its non-specific and often embarrassing symptoms, which patients frequently overlook or hesitate to report to clinicians. Crucially, the stage at which CRC is diagnosed significantly impacts survivability, with a survival rate of 80-95\% for Stage I and a stark decline to 10\% for Stage IV. Unfortunately, in the UK, only 14.4\% of cases are diagnosed at the earliest stage (Stage I).
  In this study, we propose ColonScopeX, a machine learning framework utilizing explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to enhance the early detection of CRC and pre-cancerous lesions. Our approach employs a multimodal model that integrates signals from blood sample measurements, processed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm for fingerprint smoothing, alongside comprehensive patient metadata, including medication history, comorbidities, age, weight, and BMI. By leveraging XAI techniques, we aim to render the model's decision-making process transparent and interpretable, thereby fostering greater trust and understanding in its predictions. The proposed framework could be utilised as a triage tool or a screening tool of the general population.
  This research highlights the potential of combining diverse patient data sources and explainable machine learning to tackle critical challenges in medical diagnostics.</p>

Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection.

<p>Abstract: The growing power of generative models raises major concerns about the authenticity of published content. To address this problem, several synthetic content detection methods have been proposed for uniformly structured media such as image or text. However, little work has been done on the detection of synthetic tabular data, despite its importance in industry and government. This form of data is complex to handle due to the diversity of its structures: the number and types of the columns may vary wildly from one table to another. We tackle the tough problem of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the model is deployed on table structures it has never seen before.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Wang, Chao Qu, Zuming Huang, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a textual rethinking trigger to the end of initial rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision to achieve 80.3%, 61.8%, and 43.9% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with GPT-o1.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08840">Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation For Personalized Deep Kernel Regression In Modeling Brain Trajectories</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasiliki Tassopoulou, Haochang Shou, Christos Davatzikos</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal biomedical studies monitor individuals over time to capture dynamics in brain development, disease progression, and treatment effects. However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842">Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Micah Adler, Dan Alistarh, Nir Shavit</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchu Jiang, Jiale Fu, Chenduo Hao, Xinting Hu, Yingzhe Peng, Xin Geng, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, In-context Learning (ICL) has become a significant inference paradigm in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), utilizing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) to prompt LMMs for new tasks. However, the synergistic effects in multimodal data increase the sensitivity of ICL performance to the configurations of ICDs, stimulating the need for a more stable and general mapping function. Mathematically, in Transformer-based models, ICDs act as ``shift vectors'' added to the hidden states of query tokens. Inspired by this, we introduce Mimic In-Context Learning (MimIC) to learn stable and generalizable shift effects from ICDs. Specifically, compared with some previous shift vector-based methods, MimIC more strictly approximates the shift effects by integrating lightweight learnable modules into LMMs with four key enhancements: 1) inserting shift vectors after attention layers, 2) assigning a shift vector to each attention head, 3) making shift magnitude query-dependent, and 4) employing a layer-wise alignment loss. Extensive experiments on two LMMs (Idefics-9b and Idefics2-8b-base) across three multimodal tasks (VQAv2, OK-VQA, Captioning) demonstrate that MimIC outperforms existing shift vector-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Baartmans, Andrew Ensinger, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of machine learning (ML) models have driven the growing need for custom hardware accelerators capable of efficiently supporting ML workloads. However, the design of such accelerators remains a time-consuming process, heavily relying on engineers to manually ensure design interpretability through clear documentation and effective communication. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising opportunity to automate these design interpretability tasks, particularly the generation of natural language descriptions for register-transfer level (RTL) code, what we refer to as "RTL-to-NL tasks." In this paper, we examine how design interpretability, particularly in RTL-to-NL tasks, influences the efficiency of the hardware design process. We review existing work adapting LLMs for these tasks, highlight key challenges that remain unaddressed, including those related to data, computation, and model development, and identify opportunities to address them. By doing so, we aim to guide future research in leveraging ML to automate RTL-to-NL tasks and improve hardware design interpretability, thereby accelerating the hardware design process and meeting the increasing demand for custom hardware accelerators in machine learning and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad A. A. K. Jalwana, Naveed Akhtar, Ajmal Mian, Nazanin Rahnavard, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, deep visual models are susceptible to transferable black-box adversarial attacks. Principally, these attacks craft perturbations in a target model-agnostic manner. However, surprisingly, we find that existing methods in this domain inadvertently take help from various priors that violate the black-box assumption such as the availability of the dataset used to train the target model, and the knowledge of the number of classes in the target model. Consequently, the literature fails to articulate the true potency of transferable black-box attacks. We provide an empirical study of these biases and propose a framework that aids in a prior-free transparent study of this paradigm. Using our framework, we analyze the role of prior knowledge of the target model data and number of classes in attack performance. We also provide several interesting insights based on our analysis, and demonstrate that priors cause overestimation in transferability scores. Finally, we extend our framework to query-based attacks. This extension inspires a novel image-blending technique to prepare data for effective surrogate model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Benning, Steffen Dereich</p>
<p>Abstract: Whether or not a local minimum of a cost function has a strongly convex neighborhood greatly influences the asymptotic convergence rate of optimizers. In this article, we rigorously analyze the prevalence of this property for the mean squared error induced by shallow, 1-hidden layer neural networks with analytic activation functions when applied to regression problems. The parameter space is divided into two domains: the 'efficient domain' (all parameters for which the respective realization function cannot be generated by a network having a smaller number of neurons) and the 'redundant domain' (the remaining parameters). In almost all regression problems on the efficient domain the optimization landscape only features local minima that are strongly convex. Formally, we will show that for certain randomly picked regression problems the optimization landscape is almost surely a Morse function on the efficient domain. The redundant domain has significantly smaller dimension than the efficient domain and on this domain, potential local minima are never isolated.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08872">Personalizing Federated Learning for Hierarchical Edge Networks with Non-IID Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghyun Lee, Omid Tavallaie, Shuaijun Chen, Kanchana Thilakarathna, Suranga Seneviratne, Adel Nadjaran Toosi, Albert Y. Zomaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Accommodating edge networks between IoT devices and the cloud server in Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) enhances communication efficiency without compromising data privacy. However, devices connected to the same edge often share geographic or contextual similarities, leading to varying edge-level data heterogeneity with different subsets of labels per edge, on top of device-level heterogeneity. This hierarchical non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature, which implies that each edge has its own optimization goal, has been overlooked in HFL research. Therefore, existing edge-accommodated HFL demonstrates inconsistent performance across edges in various hierarchical non-IID scenarios. To ensure robust performance with diverse edge-level non-IID data, we propose a Personalized Hierarchical Edge-enabled Federated Learning (PHE-FL), which personalizes each edge model to perform well on the unique class distributions specific to each edge. We evaluated PHE-FL across 4 scenarios with varying levels of edge-level non-IIDness, with extreme IoT device level non-IIDness. To accurately assess the effectiveness of our personalization approach, we deployed test sets on each edge server instead of the cloud server, and used both balanced and imbalanced test sets. Extensive experiments show that PHE-FL achieves up to 83 percent higher accuracy compared to existing federated learning approaches that incorporate edge networks, given the same number of training rounds. Moreover, PHE-FL exhibits improved stability, as evidenced by reduced accuracy fluctuations relative to the state-of-the-art FedAvg with two-level (edge and cloud) aggregation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08874">Distilling and exploiting quantitative insights from Large Language Models for enhanced Bayesian optimization of chemical reactions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Roshan Patel, Saeed Moayedpour, Louis De Lescure, Lorenzo Kogler-Anele, Alan Cherney, Sven Jager, Yasser Jangjou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms can significantly accelerate the optimization of chemical reactions. Transfer learning can bolster the effectiveness of BO algorithms in low-data regimes by leveraging pre-existing chemical information or data outside the direct optimization task (i.e., source data). Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that chemical information present in foundation training data can give them utility for processing chemical data. Furthermore, they can be augmented with and help synthesize potentially multiple modalities of source chemical data germane to the optimization task. In this work, we examine how chemical information from LLMs can be elicited and used for transfer learning to accelerate the BO of reaction conditions to maximize yield. Specifically, we show that a survey-like prompting scheme and preference learning can be used to infer a utility function which models prior chemical information embedded in LLMs over a chemical parameter space; we find that the utility function shows modest correlation to true experimental measurements (yield) over the parameter space despite operating in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we show that the utility function can be leveraged to focus BO efforts in promising regions of the parameter space, improving the yield of the initial BO query and enhancing optimization in 4 of the 6 datasets studied. Overall, we view this work as a step towards bridging the gap between the chemistry knowledge embedded in LLMs and the capabilities of principled BO methods to accelerate reaction optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Civitarese, Michele Fiori, Andrea Arighi, Daniela Galimberti, Graziana Florio, Claudio Bettini</p>
<p>Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) affects 12-18% of individuals over 60. MCI patients exhibit cognitive dysfunctions without significant daily functional loss. While MCI may progress to dementia, predicting this transition remains a clinical challenge due to limited and unreliable indicators. Behavioral changes, like in the execution of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), can signal such progression. Sensorized smart homes and wearable devices offer an innovative solution for continuous, non-intrusive monitoring ADLs for MCI patients. However, current machine learning models for detecting behavioral changes lack transparency, hindering clinicians' trust. This paper introduces the SERENADE project, a European Union-funded initiative that aims to detect and explain behavioral changes associated with cognitive decline using explainable AI methods. SERENADE aims at collecting one year of data from 30 MCI patients living alone, leveraging AI to support clinical decision-making and offering a new approach to early dementia detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper Linders, Jakub M. Tomczak</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising approach to robust and explainable Question Answering (QA). While LLMs excel at natural language understanding, they suffer from knowledge gaps and hallucinations. KGs provide structured knowledge but lack natural language interaction. Ideally, an AI system should be both robust to missing facts as well as easy to communicate with. This paper proposes such a system that integrates LLMs and KGs without requiring training, ensuring adaptability across different KGs with minimal human effort. The resulting approach can be classified as a specific form of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a KG, thus, it is dubbed Knowledge Graph-extended Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG). It includes a question decomposition module to enhance multi-hop information retrieval and answer explainability. Using In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, it generates explicit reasoning chains processed separately to improve truthfulness. Experiments on the MetaQA benchmark show increased accuracy for multi-hop questions, though with a slight trade-off in single-hop performance compared to LLM with KG baselines. These findings demonstrate KG-RAG's potential to improve transparency in QA by bridging unstructured language understanding with structured knowledge retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil He, Jiahong Liu, Buze Zhang, Ngoc Bui, Ali Maatouk, Menglin Yang, Irwin King, Melanie Weber, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space has been the de facto geometric setting for machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains, such as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to effectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not merely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for the next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries, foundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned structures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to match the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency and expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and empirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a roadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models, including strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning, training from scratch, and hybrid approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Lin, Abhronil Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling hierarchical data across diverse modalities. Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Tan, Song Wang, Yifan Li, Yu Kong, Jundong Li, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods provide interpretation by attributing predictions to input features. Natural explanations are expected to interpret how the inputs lead to the predictions. Thus, a fundamental question arises: Do these explanations unintentionally reverse the natural relationship between inputs and outputs? Specifically, are the explanations rationalizing predictions from the output rather than reflecting the true decision process? To investigate such explanatory inversion, we propose Inversion Quantification (IQ), a framework that quantifies the degree to which explanations rely on outputs and deviate from faithful input-output relationships. Using the framework, we demonstrate on synthetic datasets that widely used methods such as LIME and SHAP are prone to such inversion, particularly in the presence of spurious correlations, across tabular, image, and text domains. Finally, we propose Reproduce-by-Poking (RBP), a simple and model-agnostic enhancement to post-hoc explanation methods that integrates forward perturbation checks. We further show that under the IQ framework, RBP theoretically guarantees the mitigation of explanatory inversion. Empirically, for example, on the synthesized data, RBP can reduce the inversion by 1.8% on average across iconic post-hoc explanation approaches and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkyum Kim, Divya Mahajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long context processing is critical for the adoption of LLMs, but existing methods often introduce architectural complexity that hinders their practical adoption. Gisting, an in-context compression method with no architectural modification to the decoder transformer, is a promising approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing frameworks. While effective for short instructions, we demonstrate that gisting struggles with longer contexts, with significant performance drops even at minimal compression rates. Surprisingly, a simple average pooling baseline consistently outperforms gisting. We analyze the limitations of gisting, including information flow interruptions, capacity limitations and the inability to restrict its attention to subsets of the context. Motivated by theoretical insights into the performance gap between gisting and average pooling, and supported by extensive experimentation, we propose GistPool, a new in-context compression method. GistPool preserves the simplicity of gisting, while significantly boosting its performance on long context compression tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chace Ashcraft, Kiran Karra, Josh Carney, Nathan Drenkow</p>
<p>Abstract: The Treacherous Turn refers to the scenario where an artificial intelligence (AI) agent subtly, and perhaps covertly, learns to perform a behavior that benefits itself but is deemed undesirable and potentially harmful to a human supervisor. During training, the agent learns to behave as expected by the human supervisor, but when deployed to perform its task, it performs an alternate behavior without the supervisor there to prevent it. Initial experiments applying DRL to an implementation of the A Link to the Past example do not produce the treacherous turn effect naturally, despite various modifications to the environment intended to produce it. However, in this work, we find the treacherous behavior to be reproducible in a DRL agent when using other trojan injection strategies. This approach deviates from the prototypical treacherous turn behavior since the behavior is explicitly trained into the agent, rather than occurring as an emergent consequence of environmental complexity or poor objective specification. Nonetheless, these experiments provide new insights into the challenges of producing agents capable of true treacherous turn behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Slawek Smyl, Grzegorz Dudek, Pawe{\l} Pe{\l}ka</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to multivariate forecasting cryptocurrency prices using a hybrid contextual model combining exponential smoothing (ES) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The model consists of two tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track provides additional information to the main track, extracted from representative series. This information as well as information extracted from exogenous variables is dynamically adjusted to the individual series forecasted by the main track. The RNN stacked architecture with hierarchical dilations, incorporating recently developed attentive dilated recurrent cells, allows the model to capture short and long-term dependencies across time series and dynamically weight input information. The model generates both point daily forecasts and predictive intervals for one-day, one-week and four-week horizons. We apply our model to forecast prices of 15 cryptocurrencies based on 17 input variables and compare its performance with that of comparative models, including both statistical and ML ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qisai Liu, Zhanhong Jiang, Joshua R. Waite, Chao Liu, Aditya Balu, Soumik Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling is a critical yet challenging task with wide-ranging applications, especially in time series forecasting for domains like weather prediction, temperature monitoring, and energy load forecasting. Transformers, with their attention mechanism, have emerged as state-of-the-art due to their efficient parallel training, but they suffer from quadratic time complexity, limiting their scalability for long sequences. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer linear time complexity, spurring renewed interest in linear RNNs for more computationally efficient sequence modeling. In this work, we introduce BLUR (Bidirectional Linear Unit for Recurrent network), which uses forward and backward linear recurrent units (LRUs) to capture both past and future dependencies with high computational efficiency. BLUR maintains the linear time complexity of traditional RNNs, while enabling fast parallel training through LRUs. Furthermore, it offers provably stable training and strong approximation capabilities, making it highly effective for modeling long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments on sequential image and time series datasets reveal that BLUR not only surpasses transformers and traditional RNNs in accuracy but also significantly reduces computational costs, making it particularly suitable for real-world forecasting tasks. Our code is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi, Farahnaz Akrami, Chengkai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Samplawski, Adam D. Cobb, Susmit Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is a promising application area for emerging artificial intelligence methods. Traditional workflows for cyberphysical systems create detailed digital models which can be evaluated by physics simulators in order to narrow the search space before creating physical prototypes. A major bottleneck of this approach is that the simulators are often computationally expensive and slow. Recent advancements in AI methods offer the possibility to accelerate these pipelines. We use the recently released AircraftVerse dataset, which is especially suited for developing and evaluating large language models for designs. AircraftVerse contains a diverse set of UAV designs represented via textual design trees together with detailed physics simulation results. Following the recent success of large language models (LLMs), we propose AGENT (Aircraft GENeraTor). AGENT is a comprehensive design tool built on the CodeT5+ LLM which learns powerful representations of aircraft textual designs directly from JSON files. We develop a curriculum of training tasks which imbues a single model with a suite of useful features. AGENT is able to generate designs conditioned on properties of flight dynamics (hover time, maximum speed, etc.). Additionally, AGENT can issue evaluations of designs allowing it to act as a surrogate model of the physics simulation that underlies the AircraftVerse dataset. We present a series of experiments which demonstrate our system's abilities. We are able to achieve strong performance using the smallest member of the CodeT5+ family (220M parameters). This allows for a flexible and powerful system which can be executed on a single GPU enabling a clear path toward future deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojoon Lee, Takuma Seno, Jun Jet Tai, Kaushik Subramanian, Kenta Kawamoto, Peter Stone, Peter R. Wurman</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has achieved superhuman racing performance in high-fidelity simulators like Gran Turismo 7 (GT7). It typically utilizes global features that require instrumentation external to a car, such as precise localization of agents and opponents, limiting real-world applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a vision-based autonomous racing agent that relies solely on ego-centric camera views and onboard sensor data, eliminating the need for precise localization during inference. This agent employs an asymmetric actor-critic framework: the actor uses a recurrent neural network with the sensor data local to the car to retain track layouts and opponent positions, while the critic accesses the global features during training. Evaluated in GT7, our agent consistently outperforms GT7's built-drivers. To our knowledge, this work presents the first vision-based autonomous racing agent to demonstrate champion-level performance in competitive racing scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09026">Detecting Instruction Fine-tuning Attack on Language Models with Influence Function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning attacks pose a significant threat to large language models (LLMs) by subtly embedding poisoned data in fine-tuning datasets, which can trigger harmful or unintended responses across a range of tasks. This undermines model alignment and poses security risks in real-world deployment. In this work, we present a simple and effective approach to detect and mitigate such attacks using influence functions, a classical statistical tool adapted for machine learning interpretation. Traditionally, the high computational costs of influence functions have limited their application to large models and datasets. The recent Eigenvalue-Corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation method enables efficient influence score computation, making it feasible for large-scale analysis.
  We are the first to apply influence functions for detecting language model instruction fine-tuning attacks on large-scale datasets, as both the instruction fine-tuning attack on language models and the influence calculation approximation technique are relatively new. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of influence functions on 50,000 fine-tuning examples and 32 tasks reveals a strong association between influence scores and sentiment. Building on this, we introduce a novel sentiment transformation combined with influence functions to detect and remove critical poisons -- poisoned data points that skew model predictions. Removing these poisons (only 1% of total data) recovers model performance to near-clean levels, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradeep Chattopadhyay, Guillermo Basulto-Elias, Jun Ha Chang, Matthew Rizzo, Shauna Hallmark, Anuj Sharma, Soumik Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the relationship between mild cognitive impairment and driving behavior is essential to improve road safety, especially among older adults. In this study, we computed certain variables that reflect daily driving habits, such as trips to specific locations (e.g., home, work, medical, social, and errands) of older drivers in Nebraska using geohashing. The computed variables were then analyzed using a two-fold approach involving data visualization and machine learning models (C5.0, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to investigate the efficiency of the computed variables in predicting whether a driver is cognitively impaired or unimpaired. The C5.0 model demonstrated robust and stable performance with a median recall of 74\%, indicating that our methodology was able to identify cognitive impairment in drivers 74\% of the time correctly. This highlights our model's effectiveness in minimizing false negatives which is an important consideration given the cost of missing impaired drivers could be potentially high. Our findings highlight the potential of life space variables in understanding and predicting cognitive decline, offering avenues for early intervention and tailored support for affected individuals.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09028">Towards On-Device Learning and Reconfigurable Hardware Implementation for Encoded Single-Photon Signal Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenya Zang, Xingda Li, David Day Uei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reconstructing key parameters from time-resolved photon arrival signals recorded by single-photon detectors. However, the performance of conventional backpropagation-based DNNs is highly dependent on various parameters of the optical setup and biological samples under examination, necessitating frequent network retraining, either through transfer learning or from scratch. Newly collected data must also be stored and transferred to a high-performance GPU server for retraining, introducing latency and storage overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an online training algorithm based on a One-Sided Jacobi rotation-based Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSOS-ELM). We fully exploit parallelism in executing OSOS-ELM on a heterogeneous FPGA with integrated ARM cores. Extensive evaluations of OSOS-ELM and OSELM demonstrate that both achieve comparable accuracy across different network dimensions (i.e., input, hidden, and output layers), while OSOS-ELM proves to be more hardware-efficient. By leveraging the parallelism of OSOS-ELM, we implement a holistic computing prototype on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, which integrates a multi-core CPU and programmable logic fabric. We validate our approach through three case studies involving single-photon signal analysis: sensing through fog using commercial single-photon LiDAR, fluorescence lifetime estimation in FLIM, and blood flow index reconstruction in DCS, all utilizing one-dimensional data encoded from photonic signals. From a hardware perspective, we optimize the OSOS-ELM workload by employing multi-tasked processing on ARM CPU cores and pipelined execution on the FPGA's logic fabric. We also implement our OSOS-ELM on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX GPU to comprehensively investigate its computing performance on another type of heterogeneous computing platform.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have driven significant progress in various analytical tasks within 3D genomics in computational biology. However, a holistic understanding of 3D genomics knowledge remains underexplored. Here, we propose MIX-HIC, the first multimodal foundation model of 3D genome that integrates both 3D genome structure and epigenomic tracks, which obtains unified and comprehensive semantics. For accurate heterogeneous semantic fusion, we design the cross-modal interaction and mapping blocks for robust unified representation, yielding the accurate aggregation of 3D genome knowledge. Besides, we introduce the first large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million pairwise samples of Hi-C contact maps and epigenomic tracks for high-quality pre-training, enabling the exploration of functional implications in 3D genomics. Extensive experiments show that MIX-HIC can significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse downstream tasks. This work provides a valuable resource for advancing 3D genomics research.</p>

Our implementation currently deployed as a ML web application is trained on a labelled dataset derived from publicly available aviation investigation reports. A selection of five supervised learning models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbors) were evaluated. This paper showed the best performing ML algorithm was the Random Forest Classifier with accuracy = 0.77, F1 Score = 0.78 and MCC = 0.51 (average of 100 sample runs). The study had also explored the effect of applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the imbalanced dataset, and the overall observation ranged from no significant effect to substantial degradation in performance for some of the models after the SMOTE adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikas Natesh, H. T. Kung</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PQS, which uses three techniques together - Prune, Quantize, and Sort - to achieve low-bitwidth accumulation of dot products in neural network computations. In conventional quantized (e.g., 8-bit) dot products, partial results are accumulated into wide (e.g., 32-bit) accumulators to avoid overflows when accumulating intermediate partial sums. However, such wide accumulators increase memory bandwidth usage and reduce energy efficiency. We show that iterative N:M pruning in floating point followed by quantization to 8 (or fewer) bits, and accumulation of partial products in a sorted order ("small to large") allows for accurate, compressed models with short dot product lengths that do not require wide accumulators. We design, analyze, and implement the PQS algorithm to eliminate accumulation overflows at inference time for several neural networks. Our method offers a 2.5x reduction in accumulator bitwidth while achieving model accuracy on par with floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Herde, Lukas L\"uhrs, Denis Huseljic, Bernhard Sick</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdworking is a cost-efficient solution to acquire class labels. Since these labels are subject to noise, various approaches to learning from crowds have been proposed. Typically, these approaches are evaluated with default hyperparameters, resulting in suboptimal performance, or with hyperparameters tuned using a validation set with ground truth class labels, representing an often unrealistic scenario. Moreover, both experimental setups can produce different rankings of approaches, complicating comparisons between studies. Therefore, we introduce crowd-hpo as a realistic benchmark and experimentation protocol including hyperparameter optimization under noisy crowd-labeled data. At its core, crowd-hpo investigates model selection criteria to identify well-performing hyperparameter configurations only with access to noisy crowd-labeled validation data. Extensive experimental evaluations with neural networks show that these criteria are effective for optimizing hyperparameters in learning from crowds approaches. Accordingly, incorporating such criteria into experimentation protocols is essential for enabling more realistic and fair benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binghui Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In online (sequential) calibration, a forecaster predicts probability distributions over a finite outcome space $[d]$ over a sequence of $T$ days, with the goal of being calibrated. While asymptotically calibrated strategies are known to exist, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the best known algorithms require $\exp(d)$ days to achieve non-trivial calibration.
  In this work, we present the first asymptotically calibrated strategy that guarantees non-trivial calibration after a polynomial number of rounds. Specifically, for any desired accuracy $\epsilon > 0$, our forecaster becomes $\epsilon$-calibrated after $T = d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ days. We complement this result with a lower bound, proving that at least $T = d^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$ rounds are necessary to achieve $\epsilon$-calibration. Our results resolve the open questions posed by [Abernethy-Mannor'11, Hazan-Kakade'12].
  Our algorithm is inspired by recent breakthroughs in swap regret minimization [Peng-Rubinstein'24, Dagan et al.'24]. Despite its strong theoretical guarantees, the approach is remarkably simple and intuitive: it randomly selects among a set of sub-forecasters, each of which predicts the empirical outcome frequency over recent time windows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulmajid Murad, Massimiliano Ruocco</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern air traffic management, generating synthetic flight trajectories has emerged as a promising solution for addressing data scarcity, protecting sensitive information, and supporting large-scale analyses. In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: The successes of intelligent systems have quite relied on the artificial learning of information, which lead to the broad applications of neural learning solutions. As a common sense, the training of neural networks can be largely improved by specifically defined initialization, neuron layers as well as the activation functions. Though there are sequential layer based initialization available, the generalized solution to initial stages is still desired. In this work, an improved approach to initialization of neural learning is presented, which adopts the shrinkage approach to initialize the transformation of each layer of networks. It can be universally adapted for the structures of any networks with random layers, while stable performance can be attained. Furthermore, the smooth learning of networks is adopted in this work, due to the diverse influence on neural learning. Experimental results on several artificial data sets demonstrate that, the proposed method is able to present robust results with the shrinkage initialization, and competent for smooth learning of neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) powered by massive datasets, extensive parameter scales, and extensive computational resources, leading to significant transformations across various industries. Yet, their practical deployment on resource-limited mobile edge devices is hindered by critical challenges such as data privacy, constrained resources, and high overhead costs. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework, named Quantized Split Federated Fine-Tuning Large AI Model (SFLAM). By partitioning the training load between edge devices and servers using a split learning paradigm, SFLAM can facilitate the operation of large models on devices and significantly lowers the memory requirements on edge devices. Additionally, SFLAM incorporates quantization management, power control, and bandwidth allocation strategies to enhance training efficiency while concurrently reducing energy consumption and communication latency. A theoretical analysis exploring the latency-energy trade-off is presented, and the framework's efficacy is validated via comprehensive simulations. The findings indicate that SFLAM achieves superior performance in terms of learning efficiency and scalability compared to conventional methods, thereby providing a valuable approach for enabling advanced AI services in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew B. Webster, Dongheon Lee, Joonnyong Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of BSS in biosignal analysis.</p>

We explore two scenarios: fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning. Using CGCNN for property prediction and Con-CDVAE as the conditional generative model, experiments on two data-scarce material property datasets from Matminer database are conducted. Results show that synthetic data has potential in extreme data-scarce scenarios, achieving performance close to or exceeding that of real samples in all two tasks. We also find that pseudo-labels have little impact on generated data quality. Future work will integrate advanced models and optimize generation conditions to boost the effectiveness of the materials data flywheel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wen, Shijie Guo, Wenbo Ning, Rui Cao, Yan Niu, Bin Wan, Peng Wei, Xiaobo Liu, Jie Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In open data sets of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the heterogeneity of the data is typically attributed to a combination of factors, including differences in scanning procedures, the presence of confounding effects, and population diversities between multiple sites. These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the "black box" of deep learning to a certain extent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Yan, Hanzhong Cao, Ying Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09192">Towards More Efficient, Robust, Instance-adaptive, and Generalizable Online Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven online sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Online learning methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable online learning algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Norah Alballa, Wenxuan Zhang, Ziquan Liu, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Marco Canini</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized collaborative learning under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints has rapidly advanced. However, existing solutions like federated learning, ensembles, and transfer learning, often fail to adequately serve the unique needs of clients, especially when local data representation is limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Query-based Knowledge Transfer (QKT) that enables tailored knowledge acquisition to fulfill specific client needs without direct data exchange. QKT employs a data-free masking strategy to facilitate communication-efficient query-focused knowledge transfer while refining task-specific parameters to mitigate knowledge interference and forgetting. Our experiments, conducted on both standard and clinical benchmarks, show that QKT significantly outperforms existing collaborative learning methods by an average of 20.91\% points in single-class query settings and an average of 14.32\% points in multi-class query scenarios. Further analysis and ablation studies reveal that QKT effectively balances the learning of new and existing knowledge, showing strong potential for its application in decentralized learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Cheng, Yipeng Pang, Guoqiang Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised time series prediction relies on directly measured target variables, but real-world use cases such as predicting remaining useful life (RUL) involve indirect supervision, where the target variable is labeled as a function of another dependent variable. Trending temporal regression techniques rely on sequential time series inputs to capture temporal patterns, requiring interpolation when dealing with sparsely and irregularly sampled covariates along the timeline. However, interpolation can introduce significant biases, particularly with highly scarce data. In this paper, we address the RUL prediction problem with data scarcity as time series regression under indirect supervision. We introduce a unified framework called parameterized static regression, which takes single data points as inputs for regression of target values, inherently handling data scarcity without requiring interpolation. The time dependency under indirect supervision is captured via a parametrical rectification (PR) process, approximating a parametric function during inference with historical posteriori estimates, following the same underlying distribution used for labeling during training. Additionally, we propose a novel batch training technique for tasks in indirect supervision to prevent overfitting and enhance efficiency. We evaluate our model on public benchmarks for RUL prediction with simulated data scarcity. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in prediction accuracy when dealing with highly scarce time series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Liu, Xiaoqian Jiang, Cangqi Zhou, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs) since degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes with varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Zhang, Zhouzhuo Tang, Yingmei Feng, Xia Yu, Qi Jie Wang, Zhiping Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) is critical for outbreak control and public health. This study presents a diagnostic system that combines Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) from nasopharyngeal secretions with an explainable Rotary Position Embedding-Sparse Attention Transformer (RoPE-SAT) model to accurately identify multiple RVs within 10 minutes. Spectral data (4000-00 cm-1) were collected, and the bio-fingerprint region (1800-900 cm-1) was employed for analysis. Standard normal variate (SNV) normalization and second-order derivation were applied to reduce scattering and baseline drift. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to generate saliency maps, highlighting spectral regions most relevant to classification and enhancing the interpretability of model outputs. Two independent cohorts from Beijing Youan Hospital, processed with different viral transport media (VTMs) and drying methods, were evaluated, with one including influenza B, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls, and the other including mycoplasma, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls. The model achieved sensitivity and specificity above 94.40% across both cohorts. By correlating model-selected infrared regions with known biomolecular signatures, we verified that the system effectively recognizes virus-specific spectral fingerprints, including lipids, Amide I, Amide II, Amide III, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, and leverages their weighted contributions for accurate classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niels M\"undler, Jingxuan He, Hao Wang, Koushik Sen, Dawn Song, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic language features. This leaves typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. We develop novel prefix automata for this purpose and introduce a sound approach to enforce well-typedness based on type inference and a search over inhabitable types. We formalize our approach on a simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including SOTA open-weight models with more than 30B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohom Ghosh, Arnab Maji, Sudip Kumar Naskar</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting stock market prices following corporate earnings calls remains a significant challenge for investors and researchers alike, requiring innovative approaches that can process diverse information sources. This study investigates the impact of corporate earnings calls on stock prices by introducing a multi-modal predictive model. We leverage textual data from earnings call transcripts, along with images and tables from accompanying presentations, to forecast stock price movements on the trading day immediately following these calls. To facilitate this research, we developed the MiMIC (Multi-Modal Indian Earnings Calls) dataset, encompassing companies representing the Nifty 50, Nifty MidCap 50, and Nifty Small 50 indices. The dataset includes earnings call transcripts, presentations, fundamentals, technical indicators, and subsequent stock prices. We present a multimodal analytical framework that integrates quantitative variables with predictive signals derived from textual and visual modalities, thereby enabling a holistic approach to feature representation and analysis. This multi-modal approach demonstrates the potential for integrating diverse information sources to enhance financial forecasting accuracy. To promote further research in computational economics, we have made the MiMIC dataset publicly available under the CC-NC-SA-4.0 licence. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature on market reactions to corporate communications and highlights the efficacy of multi-modal machine learning techniques in financial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Kang, Jia Li, Mi Tian, Hua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate hybrid linear-morphological networks. Recent studies highlight the inherent affinity of morphological layers to pruning, but also their difficulty in training. We propose a hybrid network structure, wherein morphological layers are inserted between the linear layers of the network, in place of activation functions. We experiment with the following morphological layers: 1) maxout pooling layers (as a special case of a morphological layer), 2) fully connected dense morphological layers, and 3) a novel, sparsely initialized variant of (2). We conduct experiments on the Magna-Tag-A-Tune (music auto-tagging) and CIFAR-10 (image classification) datasets, replacing the linear classification heads of state-of-the-art convolutional network architectures with our proposed network structure for the various morphological layers. We demonstrate that these networks induce sparsity to their linear layers, making them more prunable under L1 unstructured pruning. We also show that on MTAT our proposed sparsely initialized layer achieves slightly better performance than ReLU, maxout, and densely initialized max-plus layers, and exhibits faster initial convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The dead-in-bed syndrome describes the sudden and unexplained death of young individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) without prior long-term complications. One leading hypothesis attributes this phenomenon to nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH), a dangerous drop in blood glucose during sleep. This study aims to improve NH prediction in children with T1D by leveraging physiological data and machine learning (ML) techniques. We analyze an in-house dataset collected from 16 children with T1D, integrating physiological metrics from wearable sensors. We explore predictive performance through feature engineering, model selection, architectures, and oversampling. To address data limitations, we apply transfer learning from a publicly available adult dataset. Our results achieve an AUROC of 0.75 +- 0.21 on the in-house dataset, further improving to 0.78 +- 0.05 with transfer learning. This research moves beyond glucose-only predictions by incorporating physiological parameters, showcasing the potential of ML to enhance NH detection and improve clinical decision-making for pediatric diabetes management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely used to support decisions that affect individuals -- be it to screen a patient for a serious illness or to gauge their response to treatment. In these tasks, we are limited to learning models from datasets with noisy labels. In this paper, we study the instance-level impact of learning under label noise. We introduce a notion of regret for this regime which measures the number of unforeseen mistakes due to noisy labels. We show that standard approaches to learning under label noise can return models that perform well at a population level while subjecting individuals to a lottery of mistakes. We present a versatile approach to estimate the likelihood of mistakes at the individual level from a noisy dataset by training models over plausible realizations of datasets without label noise. This is supported by a comprehensive empirical study of label noise in clinical prediction tasks. Our results reveal how failure to anticipate mistakes can compromise model reliability and adoption, and demonstrate how we can address these challenges by anticipating and avoiding regretful decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate encrypted control policy synthesis over the cloud. While encrypted control implementations have been studied previously, we focus on the less explored paradigm of privacy-preserving control synthesis, which can involve heavier computations ideal for cloud outsourcing. We classify control policy synthesis into model-based, simulator-driven, and data-driven approaches and examine their implementation over fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for privacy enhancements. A key challenge arises from comparison operations (min or max) in standard reinforcement learning algorithms, which are difficult to execute over encrypted data. This observation motivates our focus on Relative-Entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) problems, which simplifies encrypted evaluation of synthesis algorithms due to their comparison-free structures. We demonstrate how linearly solvable value iteration, path integral control, and Z-learning can be readily implemented over FHE. We conduct a case study of our approach through numerical simulations of encrypted Z-learning in a grid world environment using the CKKS encryption scheme, showing convergence with acceptable approximation error. Our work suggests the potential for secure and efficient cloud-based reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study regret minimization under privacy constraints in episodic inhomogeneous linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), motivated by the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized decision-making systems that rely on sensitive user data. In this setting, both transition probabilities and reward functions are assumed to be linear in a feature mapping $\phi(s, a)$, and we aim to ensure privacy through joint differential privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy suited to online learning. Prior work has established suboptimal regret bounds by privatizing the LSVI-UCB algorithm, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^4 K})$ regret in the non-private setting. Building on recent advances that improve this to minimax optimal regret $\widetilde{O}(HD\sqrt{K})$ via LSVI-UCB++ with Bernstein-style bonuses, we design a new differentially private algorithm by privatizing LSVI-UCB++ and adapting techniques for variance-aware analysis from offline RL. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + H^{4.5} d^{7/6} K^{1/2} / \epsilon)$, improving over previous private methods. Empirical results show that our algorithm retains near-optimal utility compared to non-private baselines, indicating that privacy can be achieved with minimal performance degradation in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsuan Wei Liao, Christopher Klugmann, Daniel Kondermann, Rafid Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality data annotation is an essential but laborious and costly aspect of developing machine learning-based software. We explore the inherent tradeoff between annotation accuracy and cost by detecting and removing minority reports -- instances where annotators provide incorrect responses -- that indicate unnecessary redundancy in task assignments. We propose an approach to prune potentially redundant annotation task assignments before they are executed by estimating the likelihood of an annotator disagreeing with the majority vote for a given task. Our approach is informed by an empirical analysis over computer vision datasets annotated by a professional data annotation platform, which reveals that the likelihood of a minority report event is dependent primarily on image ambiguity, worker variability, and worker fatigue. Simulations over these datasets show that we can reduce the number of annotations required by over 60% with a small compromise in label quality, saving approximately 6.6 days-equivalent of labor. Our approach provides annotation service platforms with a method to balance cost and dataset quality. Machine learning practitioners can tailor annotation accuracy levels according to specific application needs, thereby optimizing budget allocation while maintaining the data quality necessary for critical settings like autonomous driving technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqiang Huang, Juecen Zhan, Yumeng Sun, Xu Han, Tai An, Nan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-sensor systems are widely used in the Internet of Things, environmental monitoring, and intelligent manufacturing. However, traditional fixed-frequency sampling strategies often lead to severe data redundancy, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability, failing to meet the dynamic sensing needs of complex environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes a DQN-based multi-sensor adaptive sampling optimization method. By leveraging a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal sampling strategy, the method balances data quality, energy consumption, and redundancy. We first model the multi-sensor sampling task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), then employ a Deep Q-Network to optimize the sampling policy. Experiments on the Intel Lab Data dataset confirm that, compared with fixed-frequency sampling, threshold-triggered sampling, and other reinforcement learning approaches, DQN significantly improves data quality while lowering average energy consumption and redundancy rates. Moreover, in heterogeneous multi-sensor environments, DQN-based adaptive sampling shows enhanced robustness, maintaining superior data collection performance even in the presence of interference factors. These findings demonstrate that DQN-based adaptive sampling can enhance overall data acquisition efficiency in multi-sensor systems, providing a new solution for efficient and intelligent sensing.</p>

The simple dynamics of this model form demonstrates how expressivity can be derived primarily from iteratively composing many basic elementary operations, versus from the complexity of those elementary operations themselves. Like the analog differential analyzer and universal polynomial DAEs, the expressivity is derived instead primarily from the "depth" of the model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stella C. Dong, James R. Finlay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for insurance reserving that integrates tail-risk sensitivity, macroeconomic regime modeling, and regulatory compliance. The reserving problem is formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which reserve adjustments are optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) subject to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints. To enhance policy robustness across varying economic conditions, the agent is trained using a regime-aware curriculum that progressively increases volatility exposure.
  The reward structure penalizes reserve shortfall, capital inefficiency, and solvency floor violations, with design elements informed by Solvency II and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) frameworks. Empirical evaluations on two industry datasets--Workers' Compensation, and Other Liability--demonstrate that the RL-CVaR agent achieves superior performance relative to classical reserving methods across multiple criteria, including tail-risk control (CVaR$_{0.95}$), capital efficiency, and regulatory violation rate. The framework also accommodates fixed-shock stress testing and regime-stratified analysis, providing a principled and extensible approach to reserving under uncertainty.</p>

These constraints hinder the deployment of complex ML models, especially those requiring lifelong learning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Tin-Tin, an integer-based on-device training framework designed specifically for low-power MCUs. Tin-Tin introduces novel integer rescaling techniques to efficiently manage dynamic ranges and facilitate efficient weight updates using integer data types. Unlike existing methods optimized for devices with FPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs, Tin-Tin addresses the unique demands of tiny MCUs, prioritizing energy efficiency and optimized memory utilization. We validate the effectiveness of Tin-Tin through end-to-end application examples on real-world tiny devices, demonstrating its potential to support energy-efficient and sustainable ML applications on edge platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gengcan Chen, Donghong Cai, Zahid Khan, Jawad Ahmad, Wadii Boulila</p>
<p>Abstract: In electronic consumer Internet of Things (IoT), consumer electronic devices as edge devices require less computational overhead and the remote state estimation (RSE) of consumer electronic devices is always at risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, the adversarial strategy between consumer electronic devices and DoS attackers is critical. This paper focuses on the adversarial strategy between consumer electronic devices and DoS attackers in IoT-enabled RSE Systems. We first propose a remote joint estimation model for distributed measurements to effectively reduce consumer electronic device workload and minimize data leakage risks. The Kalman filter is deployed on the remote estimator, and the DoS attacks with open-loop as well as closed-loop are considered. We further introduce advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN, to address high-dimensional decision-making challenges in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios. Especially, the Q-network instead of the Q-table is used in the proposed approaches, which effectively solves the challenge of Q-learning. Moreover, the proposed distributed Minimax-DQN reduces the action space to expedite the search for Nash Equilibrium (NE). The experimental results validate that the proposed model can expeditiously restore the RSE error covariance to a stable state in the presence of DoS attacks, exhibiting notable attack robustness. The proposed centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN effectively resolves the NE in both open and closed-loop case, showcasing remarkable performance in terms of convergence. It reveals that substantial advantages in both efficiency and stability are achieved compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Environmental exposure to fluoride is a major public health concern, particularly in regions with naturally elevated fluoride concentrations. Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moirangthem Tiken Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault classification in industrial machinery is vital for enhancing reliability and reducing downtime, yet it remains challenging due to the variability of vibration patterns across diverse operating conditions. This study introduces a novel graph-based framework for fault classification, converting time-series vibration data from machinery operating at varying horsepower levels into a graph representation. We utilize Shannon's entropy to determine the optimal window size for data segmentation, ensuring each segment captures significant temporal patterns, and employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to define graph edges based on segment similarity. A Graph Auto Encoder (GAE) with a deep graph transformer encoder, decoder, and ensemble classifier is developed to learn latent graph representations and classify faults across various categories. The GAE's performance is evaluated on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, with cross-dataset generalization assessed on the HUST dataset. Results show that GAE achieves a mean F1-score of 0.99 on the CWRU dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models-CNN, LSTM, RNN, GRU, and Bi-LSTM (F1-scores: 0.94-0.97, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for Bi-LSTM: p < 0.05) -- particularly in challenging classes (e.g., Class 8: 0.99 vs. 0.71 for Bi-LSTM). Visualization of dataset characteristics reveals that datasets with amplified vibration patterns and diverse fault dynamics enhance generalization. This framework provides a robust solution for fault diagnosis under varying conditions, offering insights into dataset impacts on model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Fang, Chao Chen, Yongkui Yang, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering constants of motion is meaningful in helping understand the dynamical systems, but inevitably needs proficient mathematical skills and keen analytical capabilities. With the prevalence of deep learning, methods employing neural networks, such as Constant Of Motion nETwork (COMET), are promising in handling this scientific problem. Although the COMET method can produce better predictions on dynamics by exploiting the discovered constants of motion, there is still plenty of room to sharpen it. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, built using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique, and a two-phase training algorithm to improve the performance of COMET. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only retains the advantages of COMET, such as applying to non-Hamiltonian systems and indicating the number of constants of motion, but also can be more lightweight and noise-robust than COMET.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Ha, Joonas N\"attil\"a, Jordy Davelaar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce aweSOM, an open-source Python package for machine learning (ML) clustering and classification, using a Self-organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm that incorporates CPU/GPU acceleration to accommodate large ($N > 10^6$, where $N$ is the number of data points), multidimensional datasets. aweSOM consists of two main modules, one that handles the initialization and training of the SOM, and another that stacks the results of multiple SOM realizations to obtain more statistically robust clusters. Existing Python-based SOM implementations (e.g., POPSOM, Yuan (2018); MiniSom, Vettigli (2018); sklearn-som) primarily serve as proof-of-concept demonstrations, optimized for smaller datasets, but lacking scalability for large, multidimensional data. aweSOM provides a solution for this gap in capability, with good performance scaling up to $\sim 10^8$ individual points, and capable of utilizing multiple features per point. We compare the code performance against the legacy implementations it is based on, and find a 10-100x speed up, as well as significantly improved memory efficiency, due to several built-in optimizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael Makonnen, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Sonia Laguna, Julia E Vogt</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wen, Shijie Guo, Wenbo Ning, Rui Cao, Jie Xiang, Xiaobo Liu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuro-developmental disorders are manifested as dysfunctions in cognition, communication, behaviour and adaptability, and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can alleviate the increasingly strained healthcare resources on neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenbin Zhang, Zhiqiang Hu, Chuchu Jiang, Wen Chen, Jie Xu, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery. It has been extensively explored in literature and promising results are reported. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the results may be misleading and cannot be well generalized to real practice. The core observation is that the canonical randomized split of a test set in conventional evaluation leaves the test set dominated by samples with high similarity to the training set. The performance of models is severely degraded on samples with lower similarity to the training set but the drawback is highly overlooked in current evaluation. As a result, the performance can hardly be trusted when the model meets low-similarity samples in real practice. To address this problem, we propose a framework of similarity aware evaluation in which a novel split methodology is proposed to adapt to any desired distribution. This is achieved by a formulation of optimization problems which are approximately and efficiently solved by gradient descent. We perform extensive experiments across five representative methods in four datasets for two typical target evaluations and compare them with various counterpart methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed split methodology can significantly better fit desired distributions and guide the development of models.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide an overview of a common phenomenon, condensation, observed during the nonlinear training of neural networks: During the nonlinear training of neural networks, neurons in the same layer tend to condense into groups with similar outputs. Empirical observations suggest that the number of condensed clusters of neurons in the same layer typically increases monotonically as training progresses. Neural networks with small weight initializations or Dropout optimization can facilitate this condensation process. We also examine the underlying mechanisms of condensation from the perspectives of training dynamics and the structure of the loss landscape. The condensation phenomenon offers valuable insights into the generalization abilities of neural networks and correlates to stronger reasoning abilities in transformer-based language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenji Fang, Jing Wang, Yao Lu, Shang Liu, Zhiyao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation models, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design process. However, existing pre-trained circuit models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces, which restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced applications. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representations and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms that support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. Built on this aligned architecture, GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative reasoning tasks over netlists, where the model reversely generates the high-level functionality from low-level netlists in different granularities. These tasks extend traditional gate-type prediction to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3) performance in all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang An Ooi, Shehab Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban datasets such as citizen transportation modes often contain disproportionately distributed classes, posing significant challenges to the classification of under-represented samples using data-driven models. In the literature, various resampling methods have been developed to create synthetic data for minority classes (oversampling) or remove samples from majority classes (undersampling) to alleviate class imbalance. However, oversampling approaches tend to overgeneralize minor classes that are closely clustered and neglect sparse regions which may contain crucial information. Conversely, undersampling methods potentially remove useful information on certain subgroups. Hence, a resampling approach that takes the inherent distribution of data into consideration is required to ensure appropriate synthetic data creation. This study proposes an adaptive cluster-based synthetic minority oversampling technique. Density-based spatial clustering is applied on minority classes to identify subgroups based on their input features. The classes in each of these subgroups are then oversampled according to the ratio of data points of their local cluster to the largest majority class. When used in conjunction with machine learning models such as random forest and extreme gradient boosting, this oversampling method results in significantly higher F1 scores for the minority classes compared to other resampling techniques. These improved models provide accurate classification of transportation modes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Wu, Xunkai Li, Yinlin Zhu, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for its distributed training capabilities in graph-based machine intelligence applications, mitigating data silos while offering a new perspective for privacy-preserve large-scale graph learning. However, multi-level FGL heterogeneity presents various client-server collaboration challenges: (1) Model-level: The variation in clients for expected performance and scalability necessitates the deployment of heterogeneous models. Unfortunately, most FGL methods rigidly demand identical client models due to the direct model weight aggregation on the server. (2) Data-level: The intricate nature of graphs, marked by the entanglement of node profiles and topology, poses an optimization dilemma. This implies that models obtained by federated training struggle to achieve superior performance. (3) Communication-level: Some FGL methods attempt to increase message sharing among clients or between clients and the server to improve training, which inevitably leads to high communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedPG as a general prototype-guided optimization method for the above multi-level FGL heterogeneity. Specifically, on the client side, we integrate multi-level topology-aware prototypes to capture local graph semantics. Subsequently, on the server side, leveraging the uploaded prototypes, we employ topology-guided contrastive learning and personalized technology to tailor global prototypes for each client, broadcasting them to improve local training. Experiments demonstrate that FedPG outperforms SOTA baselines by an average of 3.57\% in accuracy while reducing communication costs by 168x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony C. Constantinou, Nicholas Higgins, Neville K. Kitson</p>
<p>Abstract: Hattrick is a free web-based probabilistic football manager game with over 200,000 users competing for titles at national and international levels. Launched in Sweden in 1997 as part of an MSc project, the game's slow-paced design has fostered a loyal community, with many users remaining active for decades. Hattrick's game-engine mechanics are partially hidden, and users have attempted to decode them with incremental success over the years. Rule-based, statistical and machine learning models have been developed to aid this effort and are widely used by the community. However, these models or tools have not been formally described or evaluated in the scientific literature. This study is the first to explore Hattrick using structure learning techniques and Bayesian networks, integrating both data and domain knowledge to develop models capable of explaining and simulating the game engine. We present a comprehensive analysis assessing the effectiveness of structure learning algorithms in relation to knowledge-based structures, and show that while structure learning may achieve a higher overall network fit, it does not result in more accurate predictions for selected variables of interest, when compared to knowledge-based networks that produce a lower overall network fit. Additionally, we introduce and publicly share a fully specified Bayesian network model that matches the performance of top models used by the Hattrick community. We further demonstrate how analysis extends beyond prediction by providing a visual representation of conditional dependencies, and using the best performing Bayesian network model for in-game decision-making. To support future research, we make all data, graphical structures, and models publicly available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yemin Yu, Neil Tenenholtz, Lester Mackey, Ying Wei, David Alvarez-Melis, Ava P. Amini, Alex X. Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many-shot jailbreaking (MSJ) is an adversarial technique that exploits the long context windows of modern LLMs to circumvent model safety training by including in the prompt many examples of a ``fake'' assistant responding inappropriately before the final request. With enough examples, the model's in-context learning abilities override its safety training, and it responds as if it were the ``fake'' assistant. In this work, we probe the effectiveness of different fine tuning and input sanitization approaches on mitigating MSJ attacks, alone and in combination. We find incremental mitigation effectiveness for each, and we show that the combined techniques significantly reduce the effectiveness of MSJ attacks, while retaining model performance in benign in-context learning and conversational tasks. We suggest that our approach could meaningfully ameliorate this vulnerability if incorporated into model safety post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yamato Arai, Yuma Ichikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer-wise post-training quantization has emerged as a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) without retraining. However, recent progress in this line of research is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitation and explore further improvements. This study identifies a critical bottleneck in existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the accumulation of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a lightweight and general framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating the quantization error which enable compensating for accumulated quantization errors. Additionally, we introduce a tunable propagation mechanism that allows for control over both propagation strength and computational overhead, making the framework adaptable to various architectures and resource constraints. Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2 models (7B, 13B, 70B) demonstrate that incorporating QEP into standard layer-wise PTQ pipelines outperforms standard PTQ methods. Notably, QEP yields substantial performance improvements under extreme low-bit quantization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guixian Chen, Jianhao Ma, Salar Fattahi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust subspace recovery (RSR) in the presence of both strong adversarial corruptions and Gaussian noise. Specifically, given a limited number of noisy samples -- some of which are tampered by an adaptive and strong adversary -- we aim to recover a low-dimensional subspace that approximately contains a significant fraction of the uncorrupted samples, up to an error that scales with the Gaussian noise. Existing approaches to this problem often suffer from high computational costs or rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, limiting their applicability in truly adversarial settings. To address these challenges, we revisit the classical random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which offers strong robustness to adversarial outliers, but sacrifices efficiency and robustness against Gaussian noise and model misspecification in the process. We propose a two-stage algorithm, RANSAC+, that precisely pinpoints and remedies the failure modes of standard RANSAC. Our method is provably robust to both Gaussian and adversarial corruptions, achieves near-optimal sample complexity without requiring prior knowledge of the subspace dimension, and is more efficient than existing RANSAC-type methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Goulet Coulombe</p>
<p>Abstract: I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial time series forecasting in the zero-shot setting is essential for risk management and investment decision-making, particularly during abrupt market regime shifts or in emerging markets with limited historical data. While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-based approaches have shown promise in this domain, existing meta task construction strategies often lead to suboptimal performance, especially when dealing with highly turbulent financial time series. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task construction method that leverages learned embeddings for more effective meta-learning in the zero-shot setting. Specifically, we construct two complementary types of meta-tasks based on the learned embeddings: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. To capture diverse fine-grained patterns, we apply stochastic projection matrices to the learned embeddings and use clustering algorithm to form the tasks. Additionally, to improve generalization capabilities, we employ hard task mining strategies and leverage inter-cluster tasks to identify invariant patterns across different time series. Extensive experiments on the real world financial dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, showing better generalization ability in the zero-shot scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Cheng, Amira Hijazi, Jeren Konak, Alan Erera, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans.
  This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09685">Can LLMs Revolutionize the Design of Explainable and Efficient TinyML Models?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christophe El Zeinaty, Wassim Hamidouche, Glenn Herrou, Daniel Menard, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for designing efficient neural network architectures specifically tailored to tiny machine learning (TinyML) platforms. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively. All three models surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MCUNet-in3/in4 (69.62% / 72.86%) and XiNet (72.27%), while maintaining a low computational cost of less than 100 million MACs and adhering to the stringent 320 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) constraint. These results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed framework for TinyML platforms, underscoring the potential of combining LLM-driven search, Pareto optimization, KD, and explainability to develop accurate, efficient, and interpretable models. This approach opens new possibilities in NAS, enabling the design of efficient architectures specifically suited for TinyML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Jiang, Saeed Hassanpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision tasks, but their application to gene expression analysis remains limited due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and missing values. We present GexBERT, a transformer-based autoencoder framework for robust representation learning of gene expression data. GexBERT learns context-aware gene embeddings by pretraining on large-scale transcriptomic profiles with a masking and restoration objective that captures co-expression relationships among thousands of genes. We evaluate GexBERT across three critical tasks in cancer research: pan-cancer classification, cancer-specific survival prediction, and missing value imputation. GexBERT achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy from limited gene subsets, improves survival prediction by restoring expression of prognostic anchor genes, and outperforms conventional imputation methods under high missingness. Furthermore, its attention-based interpretability reveals biologically meaningful gene patterns across cancer types. These findings demonstrate the utility of GexBERT as a scalable and effective tool for gene expression modeling, with translational potential in settings where gene coverage is limited or incomplete.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenting Wang, Guofeng Cui, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Cardoso, Vitor Santos, Jos\'e Ribeiro, Regiane Kawasaki, Ricardo Prud\^encio, Ronnie Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking is a fundamental practice in machine learning (ML) for comparing the performance of classification algorithms. However, traditional evaluation methods often overlook a critical aspect: the joint consideration of dataset complexity and an algorithm's ability to generalize. Without this dual perspective, assessments may favor models that perform well on easy instances while failing to capture their true robustness. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel evaluation methodology that combines Item Response Theory (IRT) with the Glicko-2 rating system, originally developed to measure player strength in competitive games. IRT assesses classifier ability based on performance over difficult instances, while Glicko-2 updates performance metrics - such as rating, deviation, and volatility - via simulated tournaments between classifiers. This combined approach provides a fairer and more nuanced measure of algorithm capability. A case study using the OpenML-CC18 benchmark showed that only 15% of the datasets are truly challenging and that a reduced subset with 50% of the original datasets offers comparable evaluation power. Among the algorithms tested, Random Forest achieved the highest ability score. The results highlight the importance of improving benchmark design by focusing on dataset quality and adopting evaluation strategies that reflect both difficulty and classifier proficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John J. Vastola</p>
<p>Abstract: Noether's theorem provides a powerful link between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities for systems governed by some variational principle. Perhaps unfortunately, most dynamical systems of interest in neuroscience and artificial intelligence cannot be described by any such principle. On the other hand, nonequilibrium physics provides a variational principle that describes how fairly generic noisy dynamical systems are most likely to transition between two states; in this work, we exploit this principle to apply Noether's theorem, and hence learn about how the continuous symmetries of dynamical systems constrain their most likely trajectories. We identify analogues of the conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, and briefly discuss examples of each in the context of models of decision-making, recurrent neural networks, and diffusion generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Chitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables large language models to solve multi-step tasks by framing problem solving as sequential decision problems. Outcome-based rewards, which provide feedback only on final answers, show impressive success, but face challenges with credit assignment and slow convergence. In contrast, procedure-based rewards offer efficient step-level feedback, but typically require costly human supervision. We introduce \emph{Backwards Adaptive Reward Shaping} (BARS), a no-regret framework that converts sparse outcomes-based rewards into effective procedure-based signals. BARS uses sparse rewards generated from terminal-state priors and cover trees to scale rewards while preventing exploitation. With Bellman contraction and $(\Delta, \epsilon)$-gap rewards, our backward Euler solver achieves $\epsilon$-accuracy in $O\left((R_{\max}/\Delta)\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ iterations with $O(\log T)$ dynamic regret over $T$ rounds. Our analysis, based on generic chaining, continuous scaling limits, and non-linear Feynman-Kac bounds, connects recent outcome-based methods' empirical successes with the benefits of intermediate supervision. Combined, this provides the first rigorous no-regret algorithm for outcome reward shaping, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of DeepSeek's R1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peyman Gholami, Hulya Seferoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although gossip and random walk-based learning algorithms are widely known for decentralized learning, there has been limited theoretical and experimental analysis to understand their relative performance for different graph topologies and data heterogeneity. We first design and analyze a random walk-based learning algorithm with multiple streams (walks), which we name asynchronous "Multi-Walk (MW)". We provide a convergence analysis for MW w.r.t iteration (computation), wall-clock time, and communication. We also present a convergence analysis for "Asynchronous Gossip", noting the lack of a comprehensive analysis of its convergence, along with the computation and communication overhead, in the literature. Our results show that MW has better convergence in terms of iterations as compared to Asynchronous Gossip in graphs with large diameters (e.g., cycles), while its relative performance, as compared to Asynchronous Gossip, depends on the number of walks and the data heterogeneity in graphs with small diameters (e.g., complete graphs). In wall-clock time analysis, we observe a linear speed-up with the number of walks and nodes in MW and Asynchronous Gossip, respectively. Finally, we show that MW outperforms Asynchronous Gossip in communication overhead, except in small-diameter topologies with extreme data heterogeneity. These results highlight the effectiveness of each algorithm in different graph topologies and data heterogeneity. Our codes are available for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Zhou, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Dayu Zhang, Xiongtao Zhang, Yaohong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has been extensively studied and applied due to its ability to ensure data security in distributed environments while building better models. However, clients participating in federated learning still face limitations, as clients with different structures or tasks cannot participate in learning together. In view of this, constructing a federated learning framework that allows collaboration between clients with different model structures and performing different tasks, enabling them to share valuable knowledge to enhance model efficiency, holds significant practical implications for the widespread application of federated learning. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-task federated learning with encoder-decoder structure (M-Fed). Specifically, given the widespread adoption of the encoder-decoder architecture in current models, we leverage this structure to share intra-task knowledge through traditional federated learning methods and extract general knowledge from the encoder to achieve cross-task knowledge sharing. The training process is similar to traditional federated learning, and we incorporate local decoder and global decoder information into the loss function. The local decoder iteratively updates and gradually approaches the global decoder until sufficient cross-task knowledge sharing is achieved. Our method is lightweight and modular, demonstrating innovation compared to previous research. It enables clients performing different tasks to share general knowledge while maintaining the efficiency of traditional federated learning systems. We conducted experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets to verify the feasibility of M-Fed and compared it with traditional methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of M-Fed in multi-task federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Zhou, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Zhengyi Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning has garnered widespread attention in the industry due to its efficient data utilization and strong generalization capabilities, making it particularly suitable for providing high-quality intelligent services to users. Edge devices, as the primary platforms directly serving users, play a crucial role in delivering multi-task services. However, current multi-task models are often large, and user task demands are increasingly diverse. Deploying such models directly on edge devices not only increases the burden on these devices but also leads to task redundancy. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a pre-trained multi-task model pruning method specifically designed for edge computing. The goal is to utilize existing pre-trained multi-task models to construct a compact multi-task model that meets the needs of edge devices. The specific implementation steps are as follows: First, decompose the tasks within the pre-trained multi-task model and select tasks based on actual user needs. Next, while retaining the knowledge of the original pre-trained model, evaluate parameter importance and use a parameter fusion method to effectively integrate shared parameters among tasks. Finally, obtain a compact multi-task model suitable for edge devices. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three public image datasets. The experimental results fully demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of this method, providing a new solution for multi-task learning on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Zhou, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Zhengyi Zhong, Dayu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although multi-task learning is widely applied in intelligent services, traditional multi-task modeling methods often require customized designs based on specific task combinations, resulting in a cumbersome modeling process. Inspired by the rapid development and excellent performance of single-task models, this paper proposes an efficient multi-task modeling method that can automatically fuse trained single-task models with different structures and tasks to form a multi-task model. As a general framework, this method allows modelers to simply prepare trained models for the required tasks, simplifying the modeling process while fully utilizing the knowledge contained in the trained models. This eliminates the need for excessive focus on task relationships and model structure design. To achieve this goal, we consider the structural differences among various trained models and employ model decomposition techniques to hierarchically decompose them into multiple operable model components. Furthermore, we have designed an Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF) module based on Transformer, which adaptively integrates intra-task and inter-task knowledge based on model components. Through the proposed method, we achieve efficient and automated construction of multi-task models, and its effectiveness is verified through extensive experiments on three datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asiful Arefeen, Saman Khamesian, Maria Adela Grando, Bithika Thompson, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Frequent and long-term exposure to hyperglycemia (i.e., high blood glucose) increases the risk of chronic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Current technologies like continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) primarily model specific aspects of glycemic control-like hypoglycemia prediction or insulin delivery. Similarly, most digital twin approaches in diabetes management simulate only physiological processes. These systems lack the ability to offer alternative treatment scenarios that support proactive behavioral interventions. To address this, we propose GlyTwin, a novel digital twin framework that uses counterfactual explanations to simulate optimal treatments for glucose regulation. Our approach helps patients and caregivers modify behaviors like carbohydrate intake and insulin dosing to avoid abnormal glucose events. GlyTwin generates behavioral treatment suggestions that proactively prevent hyperglycemia by recommending small adjustments to daily choices, reducing both frequency and duration of these events. Additionally, it incorporates stakeholder preferences into the intervention design, making recommendations patient-centric and tailored. We evaluate GlyTwin on AZT1D, a newly constructed dataset with longitudinal data from 21 type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients on automated insulin delivery systems over 26 days. Results show GlyTwin outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual methods, generating 76.6% valid and 86% effective interventions. These findings demonstrate the promise of counterfactual-driven digital twins in delivering personalized healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shokichi Takakura, Seng Pei Liew, Satoshi Hasegawa</p>
<p>Abstract: The federated learning (FL) framework enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data, but it remains vulnerable to privacy attacks. One promising approach is to incorporate differential privacy (DP)-a formal notion of privacy-into the FL framework. DP-FedAvg is one of the most popular algorithms for DP-FL, but it is known to suffer from the slow convergence in the presence of heterogeneity among clients' data. Most of the existing methods to accelerate DP-FL require 1) additional hyperparameters or 2) additional computational cost for clients, which is not desirable since 1) hyperparameter tuning is computationally expensive and data-dependent choice of hyperparameters raises the risk of privacy leakage, and 2) clients are often resource-constrained. To address this issue, we propose DP-FedEXP, which adaptively selects the global step size based on the diversity of the local updates without requiring any additional hyperparameters or client computational cost. We show that DP-FedEXP provably accelerates the convergence of DP-FedAvg and it empirically outperforms existing methods tailored for DP-FL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar provides a privacy-preserving solution for human motion analysis, yet its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present Radar-LLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding using millimeter-wave radar as the sensing modality. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture that incorporates deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to encode spatiotemporal point clouds into compact semantic tokens, and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To address data scarcity, we introduce a physics-aware synthesis pipeline that generates realistic radar-text pairs from motion-text datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Radar-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, enabling accurate translation of millimeter-wave signals to natural language descriptions. This breakthrough facilitates comprehensive motion understanding in privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and smart homes.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel moderate target in the Q-function update, formulated as a convex optimization of an overestimated Q-function and its lower bound. Our primary contribution lies in the efficient estimation of this lower bound through the lower expectile of the Q-value distribution conditioned on a state. Notably, our moderate target integrates seamlessly into state-of-the-art (SOTA) MF-RL algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our moderate target in mitigating overestimation bias in DDPG, SAC, and distributional RL algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work aims at developing new methodologies to optimize computational costly complex systems (e.g., aeronautical engineering systems). The proposed surrogate-based method (often called Bayesian optimization) uses adaptive sampling to promote a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Our in-house implementation, called SEGOMOE, handles a high number of design variables (continuous, discrete or categorical) and nonlinearities by combining mixtures of experts for the objective and/or the constraints. Additionally, the method handles multi-objective optimization settings, as it allows the construction of accurate Pareto fronts with a minimal number of function evaluations. Different infill criteria have been implemented to handle multiple objectives with or without constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested on practical aeronautical applications within the context of the European Project AGILE 4.0 and demonstrated favorable results. A first example concerns a retrofitting problem where a comparison between two optimizers have been made. A second example introduces hierarchical variables to deal with architecture system in order to design an aircraft family. The third example increases drastically the number of categorical variables as it combines aircraft design, supply chain and manufacturing process. In this article, we show, on three different realistic problems, various aspects of our optimization codes thanks to the diversity of the treated aircraft problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Subseasonal forecasting serves as an important support for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as climate challenges, agricultural yield and sustainable energy production. However, subseasonal forecasting is a complex task in meteorology due to dissipating initial conditions and delayed external forces. Although AI models are increasingly pushing the boundaries of this forecasting limit, they face two major challenges: error accumulation and Smoothness. To address these two challenges, we propose Climate Furnace Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (TianQuan-Climate), a novel machine learning model designed to provide global daily mean forecasts up to 45 days, covering five upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and two surface variables. Our proposed TianQuan-Climate has two advantages: 1) it utilizes a multi-model prediction strategy to reduce system error impacts in long-term subseasonal forecasts; 2) it incorporates a Content Fusion Module for climatological integration and extends ViT with uncertainty blocks (UD-ViT) to improve generalization by learning from uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TianQuan-Climate on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections within the 15 to 45-day range, where TianQuan-Climate outperforms existing numerical and AI methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junming Liu, Guosun Zeng, Ding Wang, Yanting Gao, Yufei Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Wu, Boyang Pang, Xunkai Li, Yinlin Zhu, Daohan Su, Bowen Fan, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Sun, Zhenhao Huang, Yujie Wang, Hongbo Lv, Chunyang Liu, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph clustering is a longstanding topic in machine learning. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved encouraging results, but they still require predefined cluster numbers K, and typically struggle with imbalanced graphs, especially in identifying minority clusters. The limitations motivate us to study a challenging yet practical problem: deep graph clustering without K considering the imbalance in reality. We approach this problem from a fresh perspective of information theory (i.e., structural information). In the literature, structural information has rarely been touched in deep clustering, and the classic definition falls short in its discrete formulation, neglecting node attributes and exhibiting prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we first establish a new Differentiable Structural Information, generalizing the discrete formalism to continuous realm, so that the optimal partitioning tree, revealing the cluster structure, can be created by the gradient backpropagation. Theoretically, we demonstrate its capability in clustering without requiring K and identifying the minority clusters in imbalanced graphs, while reducing the time complexity to O(N) w.r.t. the number of nodes. Subsequently, we present a novel IsoSEL framework for deep graph clustering, where we design a hyperbolic neural network to learn the partitioning tree in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space, and further conduct Lorentz Tree Contrastive Learning with isometric augmentation. As a result, the partitioning tree incorporates node attributes via mutual information maximization, while the cluster assignment is refined by the proposed tree contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the IsoSEL outperforms 14 recent baselines by an average of +1.3% in NMI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Chen, Shanshan Huang, Yunyao Cheng, Peng Chen, Zhongwen Rao, Yang Shu, Bin Yang, Lujia Pan, Chenjuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is an important task in time series analysis. Existing TSC methods mainly train on each single domain separately, suffering from a degradation in accuracy when the samples for training are insufficient in certain domains. The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm provides a promising direction for solving this problem. However, time series from different domains are substantially divergent, which challenges the effective pre-training on multi-source data and the generalization ability of pre-trained models. To handle this issue, we introduce Augmented Series and Image Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification (AimTS), a pre-training framework that learns generalizable representations from multi-source time series data. We propose a two-level prototype-based contrastive learning method to effectively utilize various augmentations in multi-source pre-training, which learns representations for TSC that can be generalized to different domains. In addition, considering augmentations within the single time series modality are insufficient to fully address classification problems with distribution shift, we introduce the image modality to supplement structural information and establish a series-image contrastive learning to improve the generalization of the learned representations for TSC tasks. Extensive experiments show that after multi-source pre-training, AimTS achieves good generalization performance, enabling efficient learning and even few-shot learning on various downstream TSC datasets.</p>

We study the symptoms of this bias both in item embeddings and in recommendations. We propose treating user interest as a stochastic process in the latent space and providing a model-agnostic implementation of this mathematical concept. The proposed stochastic component consists of elements: debiasing item embeddings with regularization for embedding uniformity, modeling dense user interest from session prefixes, and introducing fake targets in the data to simulate extended exposure. We conducted computational experiments on two popular benchmark datasets, Diginetica and YooChoose 1/64, as well as several modifications of the YooChoose dataset with different ratios of popular items. The results show that the proposed approach allows us to mitigate the challenges mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Charvet, Sebastian Stein, Roderick Murray-Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllers trained with Reinforcement Learning tend to be very specialized and thus generalize poorly when their testing environment differs from their training one. We propose a Model-Based approach to increase generalization where both world model and policy are trained in a dimensionless state-action space. To do so, we introduce the Dimensionless Markov Decision Process ($\Pi$-MDP): an extension of Contextual-MDPs in which state and action spaces are non-dimensionalized with the Buckingham-$\Pi$ theorem. This procedure induces policies that are equivariant with respect to changes in the context of the underlying dynamics. We provide a generic framework for this approach and apply it to a model-based policy search algorithm using Gaussian Process models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on simulated actuated pendulum and cartpole systems, where policies trained on a single environment are robust to shifts in the distribution of the context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiani Ni, He Zhao, Jintong Gao, Dandan Guo, Hongyuan Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, despite their success, they often face calibration issues, particularly in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where unreliable predictions can have serious consequences. Recent research has started to improve model calibration from the view of the classifier. However, the exploration of designing the classifier to solve the model calibration problem is insufficient. Let alone most of the existing methods ignore the calibration errors arising from underconfidence. In this work, we propose a novel method by balancing learnable and ETF classifiers to solve the overconfidence or underconfidence problem for model Calibration named BalCAL. By introducing a confidence-tunable module and a dynamic adjustment method, we ensure better alignment between model confidence and its true accuracy. Extensive experimental validation shows that ours significantly improves model calibration performance while maintaining high predictive accuracy, outperforming existing techniques. This provides a novel solution to the calibration challenges commonly encountered in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yin, Yan-Ming Zhang, Jian Xu, Jian-Long Chang, Yin Li, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Air quality prediction plays a crucial role in public health and environmental protection. Accurate air quality prediction is a complex multivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal patterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and particularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and chemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of atmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive meteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic interdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models air quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities, integrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to capture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\% compared to the state-of-the-art model. The source code and dataset will be available on github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Vandervoort, Miguel Costa, Morten W. Petersen, Martin Drews, Sonja Haustein, Karyn Morrissey, Francisco C. Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: Subjective wellbeing is a fundamental aspect of human life, influencing life expectancy and economic productivity, among others. Mobility plays a critical role in maintaining wellbeing, yet the increasing frequency and intensity of both nuisance and high-impact floods due to climate change are expected to significantly disrupt access to activities and destinations, thereby affecting overall wellbeing. Addressing climate adaptation presents a complex challenge for policymakers, who must select and implement policies from a broad set of options with varying effects while managing resource constraints and uncertain climate projections. In this work, we propose a multi-modular framework that uses reinforcement learning as a decision-support tool for climate adaptation in Copenhagen, Denmark. Our framework integrates four interconnected components: long-term rainfall projections, flood modeling, transport accessibility, and wellbeing modeling. This approach enables decision-makers to identify spatial and temporal policy interventions that help sustain or enhance subjective wellbeing over time. By modeling climate adaptation as an open-ended system, our framework provides a structured framework for exploring and evaluating adaptation policy pathways. In doing so, it supports policymakers to make informed decisions that maximize wellbeing in the long run.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li, Shuyan Hu, Bochun Wu, Sai Zou, Wei Ni, Falko Dressler</p>
<p>Abstract: EdgeIoT represents an approach that brings together mobile edge computing with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, allowing for data processing close to the data source. Sending source data to a server is bandwidth-intensive and may compromise privacy. Instead, federated learning allows each device to upload a shared machine-learning model update with locally processed data. However, this technique, which depends on aggregating model updates from various IoT devices, is vulnerable to attacks from malicious entities that may inject harmful data into the learning process. This paper introduces a new attack method targeting federated learning in EdgeIoT, known as data-independent model manipulation attack. This attack does not rely on training data from the IoT devices but instead uses an adversarial variational graph auto-encoder (AV-GAE) to create malicious model updates by analyzing benign model updates intercepted during communication. AV-GAE identifies and exploits structural relationships between benign models and their training data features. By manipulating these structural correlations, the attack maximizes the training loss of the federated learning system, compromising its overall effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Makrygiorgos, Joshua Hang Sai Ip, Ali Mesbah</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used method for data-driven optimization that generally relies on zeroth-order data of objective function to construct probabilistic surrogate models. These surrogates guide the exploration-exploitation process toward finding global optimum. While Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly employed as surrogates of the unknown objective function, recent studies have highlighted the potential of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as scalable and flexible alternatives. Moreover, incorporating gradient observations into GPs, when available, has been shown to improve BO performance. However, the use of gradients within BNN surrogates remains unexplored. By leveraging automatic differentiation, gradient information can be seamlessly integrated into BNN training, resulting in more informative surrogates for BO. We propose a gradient-informed loss function for BNN training, effectively augmenting function observations with local gradient information. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on well-known benchmarks in terms of improved BNN predictions and faster BO convergence as the number of decision variables increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate predictions using sequential spatiotemporal data are crucial for various applications. Utilizing real-world data, we aim to learn the intent of a smart device user within confined areas of a vehicle's surroundings. However, in real-world scenarios, environmental factors and sensor limitations result in non-stationary and irregularly sampled data, posing significant challenges. To address these issues, we developed a Transformer-based approach, STaRFormer, which serves as a universal framework for sequential modeling. STaRFormer employs a novel, dynamic attention-based regional masking scheme combined with semi-supervised contrastive learning to enhance task-specific latent representations. Comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets varying in types (including non-stationary and irregularly sampled), domains, sequence lengths, training samples, and applications, demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of STaRFormer. We achieve notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Code and data will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damian Falk, Konstantin Sch\"urholt, Damian Borth</p>
<p>Abstract: Re-using trained neural network models is a common strategy to reduce training cost and transfer knowledge. Weight space learning - using the weights of trained models as data modality - is a promising new field to re-use populations of pre-trained models for future tasks. Approaches in this field have demonstrated high performance both on model analysis and weight generation tasks. However, until now their learning setup requires homogeneous model zoos where all models share the same exact architecture, limiting their capability to generalize beyond the population of models they saw during training. In this work, we remove this constraint and propose a modification to a common weight space learning method to accommodate training on heterogeneous populations of models. We further investigate the resulting impact of model diversity on generating unseen neural network model weights for zero-shot knowledge transfer. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that including models with varying underlying image datasets has a high impact on performance and generalization, for both in- and out-of-distribution settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichao Cai, Yuhang Liu, Erdun Gao, Tianjiao Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Anton van den Hengel, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p>

Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Danilowski, Soumyajit Chatterjee, Abhirup Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at runtime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly reduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diogo Risca, Afonso Louren\c{c}o, Goreti Marreiros</p>
<p>Abstract: Although numerous machine learning models exist to detect issues like rolling bearing strain and deformation, typically caused by improper mounting, overloading, or poor lubrication, these models often struggle to isolate faults from the noise of real-world operational and environmental variability. Conditions such as variable loads, high temperatures, stress, and rotational speeds can mask early signs of failure, making reliable detection challenging. To address these limitations, this work proposes a continual deep learning approach capable of learning across domains that share underlying structure over time. This approach goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics by addressing four second-order challenges: catastrophic forgetting (where new learning overwrites past knowledge), lack of plasticity (where models fail to adapt to new data), forward transfer (using past knowledge to improve future learning), and backward transfer (refining past knowledge with insights from new domains). The method comprises a feature generator and domain-specific classifiers, allowing capacity to grow as new domains emerge with minimal interference, while an experience replay mechanism selectively revisits prior domains to mitigate forgetting. Moreover, nonlinear dependencies across domains are exploited by prioritizing replay from those with the highest prior errors, refining models based on most informative past experiences. Experiments show high average domain accuracy (up to 88.96%), with forgetting measures as low as .0027 across non-stationary class-incremental environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deyuan Liu, Peng Sun, Xufeng Li, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Yelleti</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous generation of streaming data from diverse sources, such as online transactions and digital interactions, necessitates timely fraud detection. Traditional batch processing methods often struggle to capture the rapidly evolving patterns of fraudulent activities. This paper highlights the critical importance of processing streaming data for effective fraud detection. To address the inherent challenges of latency, scalability, and concept drift in streaming environments, we propose a robust online streaming fraud detection (ROSFD) framework. Our proposed framework comprises two key stages: (i) Stage One: Offline Model Initialization. In this initial stage, a model is built in offline settings using incremental learning principles to overcome the "cold-start" problem. (ii) Stage Two: Real-time Model Adaptation. In this dynamic stage, drift detection algorithms (viz.,, DDM, EDDM, and ADWIN) are employed to identify concept drift in the incoming data stream and incrementally train the model accordingly. This "train-only-when-required" strategy drastically reduces the number of retrains needed without significantly impacting the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Overall, ROSFD utilizing ADWIN as the drift detection method demonstrated the best performance among the employed methods. In terms of model efficacy, Adaptive Random Forest consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest AUC in four out of five datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damian Falk, L\'eo Meynent, Florence Pfammatter, Konstantin Sch\"urholt, Damian Borth</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of large, structured populations of neural networks - called 'model zoos' - has led to the development of a multitude of downstream tasks ranging from model analysis, to representation learning on model weights or generative modeling of neural network parameters. However, existing model zoos are limited in size and architecture and neglect the transformer, which is among the currently most successful neural network architectures. We address this gap by introducing the first model zoo of vision transformers (ViT). To better represent recent training approaches, we develop a new blueprint for model zoo generation that encompasses both pre-training and fine-tuning steps, and publish 250 unique models. They are carefully generated with a large span of generating factors, and their diversity is validated using a thorough choice of weight-space and behavioral metrics. To further motivate the utility of our proposed dataset, we suggest multiple possible applications grounded in both extensive exploratory experiments and a number of examples from the existing literature. By extending previous lines of similar work, our model zoo allows researchers to push their model population-based methods from the small model regime to state-of-the-art architectures. We make our model zoo available at github.com/ModelZoos/ViTModelZoo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaohang Chen, Zhonghua Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks (NNs) has shown great potential in various scientific and engineering fields. However, most existing NN solvers mainly focus on satisfying the given PDEs, without explicitly considering intrinsic physical properties such as mass conservation or energy dissipation. This limitation can result in unstable or nonphysical solutions, particularly in long-term simulations. To address this issue, we propose Sidecar, a novel framework that enhances the accuracy and physical consistency of existing NN solvers by incorporating structure-preserving knowledge. Inspired by the Time-Dependent Spectral Renormalization (TDSR) approach, our Sidecar framework introduces a small copilot network, which is trained to guide the existing NN solver in preserving physical structure. This framework is designed to be highly flexible, enabling the incorporation of structure-preserving principles from diverse PDEs into a wide range of NN solvers. Our experimental results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate the improvement of the existing neural network solvers in terms of accuracy and consistency with structure-preserving properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoran Cheng, Jiahan Li, Jiajun Fan, Ge Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the flow-matching framework to discrete generative modeling. One strand of models directly works with the continuous probabilities instead of discrete tokens, which we colloquially refer to as Continuous-State Discrete Flow Matching (CS-DFM). Existing CS-DFM models differ significantly in their representations and geometric assumptions. This work presents a unified framework for CS-DFM models, under which the existing variants can be understood as operating on different $\alpha$-representations of probabilities. Building upon the theory of information geometry, we introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a family of CS-DFM models that adheres to the canonical $\alpha$-geometry of the statistical manifold, and demonstrate its optimality in minimizing the generalized kinetic energy. Theoretically, we show that the flow matching loss for $\alpha$-flow establishes a unified variational bound for the discrete negative log-likelihood. We comprehensively evaluate different instantiations of $\alpha$-flow on various discrete generation domains to demonstrate their effectiveness in discrete generative modeling, including intermediate values whose geometries have never been explored before. $\alpha$-flow significantly outperforms its discrete-state counterpart in image and protein sequence generation and better captures the entropy in language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Padron-Manrique, Juan Jos\'e Oropeza Valdez, Osbaldo Resendis-Antonio</p>
<p>Abstract: Tissue-of-origin signals dominate pan-cancer gene expression, often obscuring molecular features linked to patient survival. This hampers the discovery of generalizable biomarkers, as models tend to overfit tissue-specific patterns rather than capture survival-relevant signals. To address this, we propose a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) trained on TCGA RNA-seq data to learn representations less biased by tissue and more focused on survival. Identifying tissue-independent genetic profiles is key to revealing core cancer programs. We assess the DANN using: (1) Standard SHAP, based on the original input space and DANN's mortality classifier; (2) A layer-aware strategy applied to hidden activations, including an unsupervised manifold from raw activations and a supervised manifold from mortality-specific SHAP values. Standard SHAP remains confounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw activation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked subtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP manifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and mortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation stratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfeng Chen, Kailiang Wu, Dongbin Xiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Equations, particularly differential equations, are fundamental for understanding natural phenomena and predicting complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the governing equations for many complex systems remain unknown due to intricate underlying mechanisms. Recent advancements in machine learning and data science offer a new paradigm for modeling unknown equations from measurement or simulation data. This paradigm shift, known as data-driven discovery or modeling, stands at the forefront of AI for science, with significant progress made in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework for data-driven modeling of unknown equations using deep learning. This versatile framework is capable of learning unknown ODEs, PDEs, DAEs, IDEs, SDEs, reduced or partially observed systems, and non-autonomous differential equations. Based on this framework, we have developed Deep Unknown Equations (DUE), an open-source software package designed to facilitate the data-driven modeling of unknown equations using modern deep learning techniques. DUE serves as an educational tool for classroom instruction, enabling students and newcomers to gain hands-on experience with differential equations, data-driven modeling, and contemporary deep learning approaches such as FNN, ResNet, generalized ResNet, operator semigroup networks (OSG-Net), and Transformers. Additionally, DUE is a versatile and accessible toolkit for researchers across various scientific and engineering fields. It is applicable not only for learning unknown equations from data but also for surrogate modeling of known, yet complex, equations that are costly to solve using traditional numerical methods. We provide detailed descriptions of DUE and demonstrate its capabilities through diverse examples, which serve as templates that can be easily adapted for other applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Bhatt, Cody Rushing, Adam Kaufman, Tyler Tracy, Vasil Georgiev, David Matolcsi, Akbir Khan, Buck Shlegeris</p>
<p>Abstract: Control evaluations measure whether monitoring and security protocols for AI systems prevent intentionally subversive AI models from causing harm. Our work presents the first control evaluation performed in an agent environment. We construct BashBench, a dataset of 257 challenging multi-step system administration tasks, and evaluate whether various safety measures can prevent an adversarially constructed AI agent from covertly downloading and executing malicious code in this environment. This multi-step setting introduces new attack and defense dynamics, which we investigate in order to design novel control protocols that prevent safety failures without hindering the ability of non-malicious agents to perform useful work. We introduce a class of control protocols called resample protocols that dynamically take additional samples of certain actions. We find these protocols significantly improve on existing techniques by selectively blocking the AI agent from executing suspicious code and incriminating the agent by generating additional examples of dangerous behavior. We measure the tradeoff between attack prevention and usefulness; our best protocol combines resampling with analysis of previous steps, reducing the success rate of attacks from 58% to 7% at a 5% cost to the performance of a non-malicious agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan zhu, Jingyang zhu, Ting Wang, Yuanming Shi, Chunxiao Jiang, Khaled Ben Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) trained on electronic health records (EHRs) have shown strong performance on a range of clinical prediction tasks. However, adapting these models to local health systems remains challenging due to limited data availability and resource constraints. In this study, we investigated what these models learn and evaluated the transferability of an FM trained on MIMIC-IV to an institutional EHR dataset at the University of Chicago Medical Center. We assessed their ability to identify outlier patients and examined representation-space patient trajectories in relation to future clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the performance of supervised fine-tuned classifiers on both source and target datasets. Our findings offer insights into the adaptability of FMs across different healthcare systems, highlight considerations for their effective implementation, and provide an empirical analysis of the underlying factors that contribute to their predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Wang, Wen-Ding Li, Daniele Paliotta, Daniel Ritter, Alexander M. Rush, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective reasoning is crucial to solving complex mathematical problems. Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Dang, Christina Baek, Kaiyue Wen, Zico Kolter, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kowei Shih, Yi Han, Li Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation is an extensively explored approach to capturing users' evolving preferences based on past interactions, aimed at predicting their next likely choice. Despite significant advancements in this domain, including methods based on RNNs and self-attention, challenges like limited supervised signals and noisy data caused by unintentional clicks persist. To address these challenges, some studies have incorporated unsupervised learning by leveraging local item contexts within individual sequences. However, these methods often overlook the intricate associations between items across multiple sequences and are susceptible to noise in item co-occurrence patterns. In this context, we introduce a novel framework, Global Unsupervised Data-Augmentation (UDA4SR), which adopts a graph contrastive learning perspective to generate more robust item embeddings for sequential recommendation. Our approach begins by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, which serves as the first step to enhance the diversity and richness of the training data. Then, we build a Global Item Relationship Graph (GIG) based on all user interaction sequences. Subsequently, we employ graph contrastive learning on the refined graph to enhance item embeddings by capturing complex global associations. To model users' dynamic and diverse interests more effectively, we enhance the CapsNet module with a novel target-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UDA4SR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang, Tong Zhang, Jian Wu, Lijie Su</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, academic topic identification and topic evolution analysis are crucial for enhancing AI's understanding capabilities. Dynamic topic analysis provides a powerful approach to capturing and understanding the temporal evolution of topics in large-scale datasets. This paper presents a two-stage dynamic topic analysis framework that incorporates convex optimization to improve topic consistency, sparsity, and interpretability. In Stage 1, a two-layer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model is employed to extract annual topics and identify key terms. In Stage 2, a convex optimization algorithm refines the dynamic topic structure using the convex NMF (cNMF) model, further enhancing topic integration and stability. Applying the proposed method to IEEE journal abstracts from 2004 to 2022 effectively identifies and quantifies emerging research topics, such as COVID-19 and digital twins. By optimizing sparsity differences in the clustering feature space between traditional and emerging research topics, the framework provides deeper insights into topic evolution and ranking analysis. Moreover, the NMF-cNMF model demonstrates superior stability in topic consistency. At sparsity levels of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9, the proposed approach improves topic ranking stability by 24.51%, 56.60%, and 36.93%, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data (text, images, videos) into retrieval and generation processes, overcoming the limitations of text-only Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Micro-scale mechanisms, such as inter-particle and particle-fluid interactions, govern the behaviour of granular systems. While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges.
  This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models.
  We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks, widely recognised for their role in machine learning, are now transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modelling with classical dynamical systems and enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, the practical applicability of these models remains constrained by the opacity of their learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of these dynamical systems are predominantly restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce Event Transition Tensors, a framework based on high-order differentials that provides a rigorous mathematical description of neural ODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterising uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analysing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method enhances the interpretability and rigour of neural ODEs by expressing their behaviour through explicit mathematical structures. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems exemplify sequential decision-making under uncertainty, strategically deciding what content to serve to users, to optimise a range of potential objectives. To balance the explore-exploit trade-off successfully, Thompson sampling provides a natural and widespread paradigm to probabilistically select which action to take. Questions of causal and counterfactual inference, which underpin use-cases like offline evaluation, are not straightforward to answer in these contexts. Specifically, whilst most existing estimators rely on action propensities, these are not readily available under Thompson sampling procedures.
  We derive exact and efficiently computable expressions for action propensities under a variety of parameter and outcome distributions, enabling the use of off-policy estimators in Thompson sampling scenarios. This opens up a range of practical use-cases where counterfactual inference is crucial, including unbiased offline evaluation of recommender systems, as well as general applications of causal inference in online advertising, personalisation, and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the shift from traditional to digital media, the online landscape now hosts not only reliable news articles but also a significant amount of unreliable content. Digital media has faster reachability by significantly influencing public opinion and advancing political agendas. While newspaper readers may be familiar with their preferred outlets political leanings or credibility, determining unreliable news articles is much more challenging. The credibility of many online sources is often opaque, with AI generated content being easily disseminated at minimal cost. Unreliable news articles, particularly those that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, closely mimic the topics and writing styles of credible sources, making them difficult to distinguish. To address this, we introduce SemCAFE, a system designed to detect news reliability by incorporating entity relatedness into its assessment. SemCAFE employs standard Natural Language Processing techniques, such as boilerplate removal and tokenization, alongside entity level semantic analysis using the YAGO knowledge base. By creating a semantic fingerprint for each news article, SemCAFE could assess the credibility of 46,020 reliable and 3,407 unreliable articles on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our approach improved the macro F1 score by 12% over state of the art methods. The sample data and code are available on GitHub</p>

By fine-tuning Mistral-7B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and Pythia-6.9B on MS MARCO under diverse LoRA configurations, we investigate how relevance modeling evolves across checkpoints, the impact of LoRA rank (1, 2, 8, 32), and the relative importance of updated MHA vs. MLP components. Our ablations reveal which layers and projections within LoRA transformations are most critical for reranking accuracy. These findings offer fresh explanations into LoRA's adaptation mechanisms, setting the stage for deeper mechanistic studies in Information Retrieval. All models used in this study have been shared.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Chen, Zhipeng Jia, Samira Khan, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Phillip B. Gibbons</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces SLOs-Serve, a system designed for serving multi-stage large language model (LLM) requests with application- and stage-specific service level objectives (SLOs). The key idea behind SLOs-Serve is to customize the allocation of tokens to meet these SLO requirements. SLOs-Serve uses a multi-SLO dynamic programming-based algorithm to continuously optimize token allocations under SLO constraints by exploring the full design space of chunked prefill and (optional) speculative decoding. Leveraging this resource planning algorithm, SLOs-Serve effectively supports multi-SLOs and multi-replica serving with dynamic request routing while being resilient to bursty arrivals. Our evaluation across 6 LLM application scenarios (including summarization, coding, chatbot, tool calling, and reasoning) demonstrates that SLOs-Serve improves per-GPU serving capacity by 2.2x on average compared to prior state-of-the-art systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomei Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Yanjun Zhang, Xufei Zheng, Leo Yu Zhang, Shengshan Hu, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooya Razavi, Sonya J. Powers</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating item difficulty through field-testing is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. As such, there is strong motivation to develop methods that can predict item difficulty at scale using only the item content. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier for this goal. The present research examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty for K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation approaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the LLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based strategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features, which were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient boosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate to strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy varied by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast, the feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with correlations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both direct LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on extensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature extraction. We provide a seven-step workflow for testing professionals who would want to implement a similar item difficulty estimation approach with their item pool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Bono, Justin Grana, Kleanthis Karakolios, Pruthvi Hanumanthapura Ramakrishna, Ankit Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: We measure the association between generative AI (GAI) tool adoption and four metrics spanning security operations, information protection, and endpoint management: 1) number of security alerts per incident, 2) probability of security incident reopenings, 3) time to classify a data loss prevention alert, and 4) time to resolve device policy conflicts. We find that GAI is associated with robust and statistically and practically significant improvements in the four metrics. Although unobserved confounders inhibit causal identification, these results are among the first to use observational data from live operations to investigate the relationship between GAI adoption and security operations, data loss prevention, and device policy management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Hays, Manish Raghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers and practitioners often wish to measure treatment effects in settings where units interact via markets and recommendation systems. In these settings, units are affected by certain shared states, like prices, algorithmic recommendations or social signals. We formalize this structure, calling it shared-state interference, and argue that our formulation captures many relevant applied settings. Our key modeling assumption is that individuals' potential outcomes are independent conditional on the shared state. We then prove an extension of a double machine learning (DML) theorem providing conditions for achieving efficient inference under shared-state interference. We also instantiate our general theorem in several models of interest where it is possible to efficiently estimate the average direct effect (ADE) or global average treatment effect (GATE).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Faghih Shojaei, Rahul Gulati, Benjamin A. Jasperson, Shangshang Wang, Simone Cimolato, Dangli Cao, Willie Neiswanger, Krishna Garikipati</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AI University (AI-U), a flexible framework for AI-driven course content delivery that adapts to instructors' teaching styles. At its core, AI-U fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses from lecture videos, notes, and textbooks. Using a graduate-level finite-element-method (FEM) course as a case study, we present a scalable pipeline to systematically construct training data, fine-tune an open-source LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and optimize its responses through RAG-based synthesis. Our evaluation - combining cosine similarity, LLM-based assessment, and expert review - demonstrates strong alignment with course materials. We also have developed a prototype web application, available at https://my-ai-university.com, that enhances traceability by linking AI-generated responses to specific sections of the relevant course material and time-stamped instances of the open-access video lectures. Our expert model is found to have greater cosine similarity with a reference on 86% of test cases. An LLM judge also found our expert model to outperform the base Llama 3.2 model approximately four times out of five. AI-U offers a scalable approach to AI-assisted education, paving the way for broader adoption in higher education. Here, our framework has been presented in the setting of a class on FEM - a subject that is central to training PhD and Master students in engineering science. However, this setting is a particular instance of a broader context: fine-tuning LLMs to research content in science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Hatherley, Robert Sparrow</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to facilitate "continual learning" in medicine, in which an ML system continues to evolve in response to exposure to new data over time, even after being deployed in a clinical setting. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on the range of ethical issues raised by the use of such "adaptive" ML systems in medicine that have, thus far, been neglected in the literature.
  Target audience: The target audiences for this tutorial are the developers of machine learning AI systems, healthcare regulators, the broader medical informatics community, and practicing clinicians.
  Scope: Discussions of adaptive ML systems to date have overlooked the distinction between two sorts of variance that such systems may exhibit -- diachronic evolution (change over time) and synchronic variation (difference between cotemporaneous instantiations of the algorithm at different sites) -- and under-estimated the significance of the latter. We highlight the challenges that diachronic evolution and synchronic variation present for the quality of patient care, informed consent, and equity, and discuss the complex ethical trade-offs involved in the design of such systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Chang, Sergio Sancho, Jingwei Tang, Markus Gross, Vinicius C. Azevedo</p>
<p>Abstract: Anamorphosis refers to a category of images that are intentionally distorted, making them unrecognizable when viewed directly. Their true form only reveals itself when seen from a specific viewpoint, which can be through some catadioptric device like a mirror or a lens. While the construction of these mathematical devices can be traced back to as early as the 17th century, they are only interpretable when viewed from a specific vantage point and tend to lose meaning when seen normally. In this paper, we revisit these famous optical illusions with a generative twist. With the help of latent rectified flow models, we propose a method to create anamorphic images that still retain a valid interpretation when viewed directly. To this end, we introduce Laplacian Pyramid Warping, a frequency-aware image warping technique key to generating high-quality visuals. Our work extends Visual Anagrams (arXiv:2311.17919) to latent space models and to a wider range of spatial transforms, enabling the creation of novel generative perceptual illusions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital elevation models derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data over glacial and snow-covered regions often exhibit systematic elevation errors, commonly termed "penetration bias." We leverage existing physics-based models and propose an integrated correction framework that combines parametric physical modeling with machine learning. We evaluate the approach across three distinct training scenarios - each defined by a different set of acquisition parameters - to assess overall performance and the model's ability to generalize. Our experiments on Greenland's ice sheet using TanDEM-X data show that the proposed hybrid model corrections significantly reduce the mean and standard deviation of DEM errors compared to a purely physical modeling baseline. The hybrid framework also achieves significantly improved generalization than a pure ML approach when trained on data with limited diversity in acquisition parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjie Deng, Yan Wei, Hao Zhai, An Wu, Yuncan Ouyang, Qianyao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In image fusion tasks, due to the lack of real fused images as priors, most deep learning-based fusion methods obtain global weight features from original images in large-scale data pairs to generate images that approximate real fused images. However, unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes Granular Ball adaptation to extract features in the brightness space as priors for deep networks, enabling the fusion network to converge quickly and complete the fusion task. This leads to few-shot training for a general image fusion network, and based on this, we propose the GBFF fusion method. According to the information expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we classify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and non-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference in the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for pixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate supervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural brightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also adaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image in the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and pixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the fused images. Each modality only used 10 pairs of images as the training set, completing the fusion task with a limited number of iterations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and theory, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons with SOTA methods show that this approach is highly competitive in terms of fusion time and image expressiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Liao, Shuaishuai Zu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

<p>Abstract: We study structured Stackelberg games, in which both players (the leader and the follower) observe information about the state of the world at time of play. Importantly, this information may contain information about the follower, which the leader may use when deciding her strategy. Under this setting, we show that no-regret learning is possible if and only if the set of mappings from contexts to follower types that the leader uses to learn is not ``too complex''. Specifically, we find that standard learning theoretic measures of complexity do not characterize learnability in our setting and we give a new dimension which does, which we term the Stackelberg-Littlestone dimension. In the distributional setting, we give analogous results by showing that standard complexity measures do not characterize the sample complexity of learning, but a new dimension called the Stackelberg-Natarajan dimension does. We then show that an appropriate empirical risk minimization procedure achieves the corresponding sample complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this letter, we explore the communication-control co-design of discrete-time stochastic linear systems through reinforcement learning. Specifically, we examine a closed-loop system involving two sequential decision-makers: a scheduler and a controller. The scheduler continuously monitors the system's state but transmits it to the controller intermittently to balance the communication cost and control performance. The controller, in turn, determines the control input based on the intermittently received information. Given the partially nested information structure, we show that the optimal control policy follows a certainty-equivalence form. Subsequently, we analyze the qualitative behavior of the scheduling policy. To develop the optimal scheduling policy, we propose InterQ, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm which uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. Through extensive numerical evaluations, we analyze the scheduling landscape and further compare our approach against two baseline strategies: (a) a multi-period periodic scheduling policy, and (b) an event-triggered policy. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both baselines. The open source implementation can be found at https://github.com/AC-sh/InterQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yang Xiao, Jie Ji, Kaiyuan Deng, Bo Hui, Linke Guo, Xiaolong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analyzing high-dimensional data presents challenges due to the "curse of dimensionality'', making computations intensive. Dimension reduction techniques, categorized as linear or non-linear, simplify such data. Non-linear methods are particularly essential for efficiently visualizing and processing complex data structures in interactive and graphical applications. This research develops an incremental non-linear dimension reduction method using the Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) framework for streaming data. The proposed method enables real-time data analysis and visualization by incrementally updating the cluster map, PCA basis vectors, and wavelet coefficients. Numerical experiments show that the incremental GMRA accurately represents non-linear manifolds even with small initial samples and aligns closely with batch GMRA, demonstrating efficient updates and maintaining the multiscale structure. The findings highlight the potential of Incremental GMRA for real-time visualization and interactive graphics applications that require adaptive high-dimensional data representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikas Natesh, H. T. Kung, David Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: We offer a novel approach, MGS (Markov Greedy Sums), to improve the accuracy of low-bitwidth floating-point dot products in neural network computations. In conventional 32-bit floating-point summation, adding values with different exponents may lead to loss of precision in the mantissa of the smaller term, which is right-shifted to align with the larger term's exponent. Such shifting (a.k.a. 'swamping') is a significant source of numerical errors in accumulation when implementing low-bitwidth dot products (e.g., 8-bit floating point) as the mantissa has a small number of bits. We avoid most swamping errors by arranging the terms in dot product summation based on their exponents and summing the mantissas without overflowing the low-bitwidth accumulator. We design, analyze, and implement the algorithm to minimize 8-bit floating point error at inference time for several neural networks. In contrast to traditional sequential summation, our method has significantly lowered numerical errors, achieving classification accuracy on par with high-precision floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks. Our dMAC hardware units can reduce power consumption by up to 34.1\% relative to conventional MAC units.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moyang Liu, Kaiying Yan, Yukun Liu, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Xuefei Liu, Chenxing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread dissemination of fake news across multiple content forms, including text, images, audio, and video. Compared to unimodal fake news detection, multimodal fake news detection benefits from the increased availability of information across multiple modalities. However, in the context of social media, certain modalities in multimodal fake news detection tasks may contain disruptive or over-expressive information. These elements often include exaggerated or embellished content. We define this phenomenon as modality disruption and explore its impact on detection models through experiments. To address the issue of modality disruption in a targeted manner, we propose a multimodal fake news detection framework, FND-MoE. Additionally, we design a two-pass feature selection mechanism to further mitigate the impact of modality disruption. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC-2018 datasets demonstrate that FND-MoE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with accuracy improvements of 3.45% and 3.71% on the respective datasets compared to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keiichiro Seno, Kota Matsui, Shogo Iwazaki, Yu Inatsu, Shion Takeno, Shigeyuki Matsui</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary objective of phase I cancer clinical trials is to evaluate the safety of a new experimental treatment and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We show that the MTD estimation problem can be regarded as a level set estimation (LSE) problem whose objective is to determine the regions where an unknown function value is above or below a given threshold. Then, we propose a novel dose-finding design in the framework of LSE. The proposed design determines the next dose on the basis of an acquisition function incorporating uncertainty in the posterior distribution of the dose-toxicity curve as well as overdose control. Simulation experiments show that the proposed LSE design achieves a higher accuracy in estimating the MTD and involves a lower risk of overdosing allocation compared to existing designs, thereby indicating that it provides an effective methodology for phase I cancer clinical trial design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moyang Liu, Kaiying Yan, Yukun Liu, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Xuefei Liu, Chenxing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread dissemination of fake news across multiple content forms, including text, images, audio, and video. Traditional unimodal detection methods fall short in addressing complex cross-modal manipulations; as a result, multimodal fake news detection has emerged as a more effective solution. However, existing multimodal approaches, especially in the context of fake news detection on social media, often overlook the confounders hidden within complex cross-modal interactions, leading models to rely on spurious statistical correlations rather than genuine causal mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the Causal Intervention-based Multimodal Deconfounded Detection (CIMDD) framework, which systematically models three types of confounders via a unified Structural Causal Model (SCM): (1) Lexical Semantic Confounder (LSC); (2) Latent Visual Confounder (LVC); (3) Dynamic Cross-Modal Coupling Confounder (DCCC). To mitigate the influence of these confounders, we specifically design three causal modules based on backdoor adjustment, frontdoor adjustment, and cross-modal joint intervention to block spurious correlations from different perspectives and achieve causal disentanglement of representations for deconfounded reasoning. Experimental results on the FakeSV and FVC datasets demonstrate that CIMDD significantly improves detection accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.27% and 4.80%, respectively. Furthermore, extensive experimental results indicate that CIMDD exhibits strong generalization and robustness across diverse multimodal scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Yang, Haotian Fu, Herui Zhang, Peng Zhang, Wei Li, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding brain signals accurately and efficiently is crucial for intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces. Traditional decoding approaches based on neural activity vector features suffer from low accuracy, whereas deep learning based approaches have high computational cost. To improve both the decoding accuracy and efficiency, this paper proposes a spiking neural network (SNN) for effective and energy-efficient intra-cortical brain signal decoding. We also propose a feature fusion approach, which integrates the manually extracted neural activity vector features with those extracted by a deep neural network, to further improve the decoding accuracy. Experiments in decoding motor-related intra-cortical brain signals of two rhesus macaques demonstrated that our SNN model achieved higher accuracy than traditional artificial neural networks; more importantly, it was tens or hundreds of times more efficient. The SNN model is very suitable for high precision and low power applications like intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Kan, Huanyu Wu, Zhenyao Cui, Fan Huang, Xiaolong Xu, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is an important component of affective computing, and also human-machine interaction. Unimodal emotion recognition is convenient, but the accuracy may not be high enough; on the contrary, multi-modal emotion recognition may be more accurate, but it also increases the complexity and cost of the data collection system. This paper considers cross-modal emotion recognition, i.e., using both electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement in training, but only EEG or eye movement in test. We propose cross-modal contrastive representation distillation (CMCRD), which uses a pre-trained eye movement classification model to assist the training of an EEG classification model, improving feature extraction from EEG signals, or vice versa. During test, only EEG signals (or eye movement signals) are acquired, eliminating the need for multi-modal data. CMCRD not only improves the emotion recognition accuracy, but also makes the system more simplified and practical. Experiments using three different neural network architectures on three multi-modal emotion recognition datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of CMCRD. Compared with the EEG-only model, it improved the average classification accuracy by about 6.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjin Ke, Zhe Li, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the efficiency of inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical area of research. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in downstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem, but it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we introduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT), which merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the total parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization magnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each quantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and direction in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant improvements over our baseline method across different quantization granularities. For instance, for LLaMA-7B, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.2% in MMLU on 3-bit LLaMA-7B model. Additionally, our quantization results on pre-trained models also surpass previous QAT methods, demonstrating the superior performance and efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over academic handwritten notes remains a challenge in document AI, particularly for mathematical equations, diagrams, and scientific notations. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks focus on printed or structured handwritten text, limiting generalization to real-world note-taking. To address this, we introduce NoTeS-Bank, an evaluation benchmark for Neural Transcription and Search in note-based question answering. NoTeS-Bank comprises complex notes across multiple domains, requiring models to process unstructured and multimodal content. The benchmark defines two tasks: (1) Evidence-Based VQA, where models retrieve localized answers with bounding-box evidence, and (2) Open-Domain VQA, where models classify the domain before retrieving relevant documents and answers. Unlike classical Document VQA datasets relying on optical character recognition (OCR) and structured data, NoTeS-BANK demands vision-language fusion, retrieval, and multimodal reasoning. We benchmark state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and retrieval frameworks, exposing structured transcription and reasoning limitations. NoTeS-Bank provides a rigorous evaluation with NDCG@5, MRR, Recall@K, IoU, and ANLS, establishing a new standard for visual document understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keisuke Murota</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenji Fang, Wenkai Li, Shang Liu, Yao Lu, Hongce Zhang, Zhiyao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Circuit representation learning has shown promise in advancing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) by capturing structural and functional circuit properties for various tasks. Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph learning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation. However, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to fully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models (LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness for flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present NetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph structure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional and physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG formulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic logic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its multimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics and a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph self-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG captures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that NetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely different functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG encoders, demonstrating its versatility.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on a discretized parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, which emerges as a continuous limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm commonly used in optimal transport. Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osvaldo Simeone, Sangwoo Park, Matteo Zecchin</p>
<p>Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Spears, Shen Zhu, Yinzhu Jin, Aman Shrivastava, P. Thomas Fletcher</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce MedIL, a first-of-its-kind autoencoder built for encoding medical images with heterogeneous sizes and resolutions for image generation. Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine details are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically when considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology, making realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent diffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a fixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image acquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details. MedIL utilizes implicit neural representations to treat images as continuous signals, where encoding and decoding can be performed at arbitrary resolutions without prior resampling. We quantitatively and qualitatively show how MedIL compresses and preserves clinically-relevant features over large multi-site, multi-resolution datasets of both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs. We further demonstrate how MedIL can influence the quality of images generated with a diffusion model, and discuss how MedIL can enhance generative models to resemble raw clinical acquisitions.</p>

To address data scarcity, we propose an end-to-end system for synthetic data generation for scalable, high-quality, and customizable 3D indoor scenes. By integrating and adapting text-to-image and multi-view diffusion models with Neural Radiance Field-based meshing, this system generates highfidelity 3D object assets from text prompts and incorporates them into pre-defined floor plans using a rendering tool. By introducing novel loss functions and training strategies into existing methods, the system supports on-demand scene generation, aiming to alleviate the scarcity of current available data, generally manually crafted by artists. This system advances the role of synthetic data in addressing machine learning training limitations, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning is revolutionizing global weather forecasting, with models that efficiently produce highly accurate forecasts. Apart from global forecasting there is also a large value in high-resolution regional weather forecasts, focusing on accurate simulations of the atmosphere for a limited area. Initial attempts have been made to use machine learning for such limited area scenarios, but these experiments do not consider realistic forecasting settings and do not investigate the many design choices involved. We present a framework for building kilometer-scale machine learning limited area models with boundary conditions imposed through a flexible boundary forcing method. This enables boundary conditions defined either from reanalysis or operational forecast data. Our approach employs specialized graph constructions with rectangular and triangular meshes, along with multi-step rollout training strategies to improve temporal consistency. We perform systematic evaluation of different design choices, including the boundary width, graph construction and boundary forcing integration. Models are evaluated across both a Danish and a Swiss domain, two regions that exhibit different orographical characteristics. Verification is performed against both gridded analysis data and in-situ observations, including a case study for the storm Ciara in February 2020. Both models achieve skillful predictions across a wide range of variables, with our Swiss model outperforming the numerical weather prediction baseline for key surface variables. With their substantially lower computational cost, our findings demonstrate great potential for machine learning limited area models in the future of regional weather forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuran Meng, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for prediction, inference on estimated means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this gap by framing the problem within the generalized linear models (GLMs) framework and developing a rigorous statistical approach for inference on DNN-estimated means. To address a key limitation of assuming independence between prediction errors and input variables in the literature, which often fails in GLMs, we introduce a truncation technique that partitions the problem into regimes with distinct noise behaviors, enabling refined analysis and robust theoretical guarantees under general GLM frameworks. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals. This method enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through extensive simulations across Binary, Poisson and Binomial models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to real-world data from the eICU dataset to predict patient readmission risks, providing actionable insights for clinical decision-making.</p>

In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is central to disease management. Existing deep learning models require large-scale annotated datasets and often function as "black boxes". Additionally, datasets in clinical practice are frequently small or unlabeled, restricting the full potential of deep learning methods. Here, we introduce REMEMBER -- Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning -- a new machine learning framework that facilitates zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis using brain MRI scans through a reference-based reasoning process. Specifically, REMEMBER first trains a contrastively aligned vision-text model using expert-annotated reference data and extends pseudo-text modalities that encode abnormality types, diagnosis labels, and composite clinical descriptions. Then, at inference time, REMEMBER retrieves similar, human-validated cases from a curated dataset and integrates their contextual information through a dedicated evidence encoding module and attention-based inference head. Such an evidence-guided design enables REMEMBER to imitate real-world clinical decision-making process by grounding predictions in retrieved imaging and textual context. Specifically, REMEMBER outputs diagnostic predictions alongside an interpretable report, including reference images and explanations aligned with clinical workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that REMEMBER achieves robust zero- and few-shot performance and offers a powerful and explainable framework to neuroimaging-based diagnosis in the real world, especially under limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic generation control (AGC) systems play a crucial role in maintaining system frequency across power grids. However, AGC systems' reliance on communicated measurements exposes them to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which can compromise the overall system stability. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based detection framework that identifies FDIAs and determines the compromised measurements. The approach utilizes an ML model trained offline to accurately detect attacks and classify the manipulated signals based on a comprehensive set of statistical and time-series features extracted from AGC measurements before and after disturbances. For the proposed approach, we compare the performance of several powerful ML algorithms. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting FDIAs while maintaining a low false alarm rate, with an F1-score of up to 99.98%, outperforming existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nooshin Bahador</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explored whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) developed orientation and color biases similar to those observed in the human brain. Using synthetic datasets with controlled variations in noise levels, angles, lengths, widths, and colors, we analyzed the behavior of ViTs fine-tuned with LoRA. Our findings revealed four key insights: First, ViTs exhibited an oblique effect showing the lowest angle prediction errors at 180 deg (horizontal) across all conditions. Second, angle prediction errors varied by color. Errors were highest for bluish hues and lowest for yellowish ones. Additionally, clustering analysis of angle prediction errors showed that ViTs grouped colors in a way that aligned with human perceptual categories. In addition to orientation and color biases, we observed phase transition phenomena. While two phase transitions occurred consistently across all conditions, the training loss curves exhibited delayed transitions when color was incorporated as an additional data attribute. Finally, we observed that attention heads in certain layers inherently develop specialized capabilities, functioning as task-agnostic feature extractors regardless of the downstream task. These observations suggest that biases and properties arise primarily from pre-training on the original dataset which shapes the model's foundational representations and the inherent architectural constraints of the vision transformer, rather than being solely determined by downstream data statistics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiankun Shi, Xiao Wang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study nonconvex constrained stochastic zeroth-order optimization problems, for which we have access to exact information of constraints and noisy function values of the objective. We propose a Bregman linearized augmented Lagrangian method that utilizes stochastic zeroth-order gradient estimators combined with a variance reduction technique. We analyze its oracle complexity, in terms of the total number of stochastic function value evaluations required to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-KKT point in \(\ell_p\)-norm metrics with \(p \ge 2\), where \(p\) is a parameter associated with the selected Bregman distance. In particular, starting from a near-feasible initial point and using Rademacher smoothing, the oracle complexity is in order \(O(p d^{2/p} \epsilon^{-3})\) for \(p \in [2, 2 \ln d]\), and \(O(\ln d \cdot \epsilon^{-3})\) for \(p > 2 \ln d\), where \(d\) denotes the problem dimension. Those results show that the complexity of the proposed method can achieve a dimensional dependency lower than \(O(d)\) without requiring additional assumptions, provided that a Bregman distance is chosen properly. This offers a significant improvement in the high-dimensional setting over existing work, and matches the lowest complexity order with respect to the tolerance \(\epsilon\) reported in the literature.

<p>Abstract: Existing SAR image classification methods based on Contrastive Learning often rely on sample generation strategies designed for optical images, failing to capture the distinct semantic and physical characteristics of SAR data. To address this, we propose Physics-Driven Contrastive Mutual Learning for SAR Classification (PCM-SAR), which incorporates domain-specific physical insights to improve sample generation and feature extraction. PCM-SAR utilizes the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to simulate realistic noise patterns and applies semantic detection for unsupervised local sampling, ensuring generated samples accurately reflect SAR imaging properties. Additionally, a multi-level feature fusion mechanism based on mutual learning enables collaborative refinement of feature representations. Notably, PCM-SAR significantly enhances smaller models by refining SAR feature representations, compensating for their limited capacity. Experimental results show that PCM-SAR consistently outperforms SOTA methods across diverse datasets and SAR classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> The Tien Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparse phase retrieval, a fundamental inverse problem in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, where a signal need to be reconstructed using only the magnitude of its transformation while phase information remains inaccessible. Leveraging the inherent sparsity of many real-world signals, we introduce a novel sparse quasi-Bayesian approach and provide the first theoretical guarantees for such an approach. Specifically, we employ a scaled Student distribution as a continuous shrinkage prior to enforce sparsity and analyze the method using the PAC-Bayesian inequality framework. Our results establish that the proposed Bayesian estimator achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates under sub-exponential noise, matching those of state-of-the-art frequentist methods. To ensure computational feasibility, we develop an efficient Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs comparably to existing frequentist techniques, highlighting its potential as a principled alternative for sparse phase retrieval in noisy settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aisha L. Shuaibu, Kieran A. Gibb, Peter A. Wijeratne, Ivor J. A. Simpson</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal image registration enables studying temporal changes in brain morphology which is useful in applications where monitoring the growth or atrophy of specific structures is important. However this task is challenging due to; noise/artifacts in the data and quantifying small anatomical changes between sequential scans. We propose a novel longitudinal registration method that models structural changes using temporally parameterized neural displacement fields. Specifically, we implement an implicit neural representation (INR) using a multi-layer perceptron that serves as a continuous coordinate-based approximation of the deformation field at any time point. In effect, for any N scans of a particular subject, our model takes as input a 3D spatial coordinate location x, y, z and a corresponding temporal representation t and learns to describe the continuous morphology of structures for both observed and unobserved points in time. Furthermore, we leverage the analytic derivatives of the INR to derive a new regularization function that enforces monotonic rate of change in the trajectory of the voxels, which is shown to provide more biologically plausible patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 4D brain MR registration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxuan He, Yuan Gao, Liping Zhu, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing conditional independence between two random vectors given a third is a fundamental and challenging problem in statistics, particularly in multivariate nonparametric settings due to the complexity of conditional structures. We propose a novel framework for testing conditional independence using transport maps. At the population level, we show that two well-defined transport maps can transform the conditional independence test into an unconditional independence test, this substantially simplifies the problem. These transport maps are estimated from data using conditional continuous normalizing flow models. Within this framework, we derive a test statistic and prove its consistency under both the null and alternative hypotheses. A permutation-based procedure is employed to evaluate the significance of the test. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulations and real-data analysis. Our numerical studies demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method for conditional independence testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Theodoropoulos, Andrei Catalin Coman, James Henderson, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge discovery is hindered by the increasing volume of publications and the scarcity of extensive annotated data. To tackle the challenge of information overload, it is essential to employ automated methods for knowledge extraction and processing. Finding the right balance between the level of supervision and the effectiveness of models poses a significant challenge. While supervised techniques generally result in better performance, they have the major drawback of demanding labeled data. This requirement is labor-intensive and time-consuming and hinders scalability when exploring new domains. In this context, our study addresses the challenge of identifying semantic relationships between biomedical entities (e.g., diseases, proteins) in unstructured text while minimizing dependency on supervision. We introduce a suite of unsupervised algorithms based on dependency trees and attention mechanisms and employ a range of pointwise binary classification methods. Transitioning from weakly supervised to fully unsupervised settings, we assess the methods' ability to learn from data with noisy labels. The evaluation on biomedical benchmark datasets explores the effectiveness of the methods. Our approach tackles a central issue in knowledge discovery: balancing performance with minimal supervision. By gradually decreasing supervision, we assess the robustness of pointwise binary classification techniques in handling noisy labels, revealing their capability to shift from weakly supervised to entirely unsupervised scenarios. Comprehensive benchmarking offers insights into the effectiveness of these techniques, suggesting an encouraging direction toward adaptable knowledge discovery systems, representing progress in creating data-efficient methodologies for extracting useful insights when annotated data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Yao, Haoran Shi, Yidou Chen, Yixin Jiang, Cong Wang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren, Chun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Pan, Shaowen Wang, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Wei, Xiaoqi Zhao, Jonghye Woo, Jinsong Ouyang, Georges El Fakhri, Qingyu Chen, Xiaofeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single domain generalization (SDG) has recently attracted growing attention in medical image segmentation. One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continued pre-training of small language models offers a promising path for domain adaptation with limited computational resources. I've investigated this approach within educational domains, evaluating it as a resource-efficient alternative to training models from scratch. Using a 125M parameter model, I demonstrate significant performance improvements through incremental training on 400 million tokens, followed by further training to reach 1 billion tokens. My approach includes comprehensive data preprocessing, memory-optimized training configurations, and benchmark-based evaluation. Results show notable gains in knowledge-intensive tasks (MMLU +8.1%) and contextual understanding (HellaSwag +7.6%), while revealing educational domain specialization trade-offs. I analyze token efficiency, catastrophic forgetting mitigation strategies, and scaling patterns. My findings suggest that thoughtful preprocessing and training methodologies enable meaningful improvements in language model capabilities even with constrained computational resources, opening pathways for domain-specific adaptation of smaller language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent prompt-based image editing models have demonstrated impressive prompt-following capability at structural editing tasks. However, existing models still fail to perform local edits, follow detailed editing prompts, or maintain global image quality beyond a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and improves image quality consistently during more than 100 editing steps. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. SPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic image-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal, replacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and structural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the highest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but it is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard multimodal self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms regard cross-modal synchronization as implicit supervisory labels during pretraining, thus posing high requirements on the scale and quality of multimodal samples. These constraints significantly limit the performance of sensing intelligence in IoT applications, as the heterogeneity and the non-interpretability of time-series signals result in abundant unimodal data but scarce high-quality multimodal pairs. This paper proposes InfoMAE, a cross-modal alignment framework that tackles the challenge of multimodal pair efficiency under the SSL setting by facilitating efficient cross-modal alignment of pretrained unimodal representations. InfoMAE achieves \textit{efficient cross-modal alignment} with \textit{limited data pairs} through a novel information theory-inspired formulation that simultaneously addresses distribution-level and instance-level alignment. Extensive experiments on two real-world IoT applications are performed to evaluate InfoMAE's pairing efficiency to bridge pretrained unimodal models into a cohesive joint multimodal model. InfoMAE enhances downstream multimodal tasks by over 60% with significantly improved multimodal pairing efficiency. It also improves unimodal task accuracy by an average of 22%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gavin Zhang, Salar Fattahi, Richard Y. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical instances of nonconvex matrix factorization, the rank of the true solution $r^{\star}$ is often unknown, so the rank $r$ of the model can be overspecified as $r>r^{\star}$. This over-parameterized regime of matrix factorization significantly slows down the convergence of local search algorithms, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r>r^{\star}$. We propose an inexpensive preconditioner for the matrix sensing variant of nonconvex matrix factorization that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear, even in the over-parameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the ground truth. Classical gradient descent in a neighborhood of the solution slows down due to the need for the model matrix factor to become singular. Our key result is that this singularity can be corrected by $\ell_{2}$ regularization with a specific range of values for the damping parameter. In fact, a good damping parameter can be inexpensively estimated from the current iterate. The resulting algorithm, which we call preconditioned gradient descent or PrecGD, is stable under noise, and converges linearly to an information theoretically optimal error bound. Our numerical experiments find that PrecGD works equally well in restoring the linear convergence of other variants of nonconvex matrix factorization in the over-parameterized regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents the Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified epsilon-neighborhood. Evaluations are conducted on three nonlinear test functions and a case study of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. The EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peer review at AI conferences is stressed by rapidly rising submission volumes, leading to deteriorating review quality and increased author dissatisfaction. To address these issues, we developed Review Feedback Agent, a system leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve review clarity and actionability by providing automated feedback on vague comments, content misunderstandings, and unprofessional remarks to reviewers. Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews. To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests. The results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers. Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions. This work demonstrates that carefully designed LLM-generated review feedback can enhance peer review quality by making reviews more specific and actionable while increasing engagement between reviewers and authors.

<p>Abstract: Detecting transitions between intro/credits and main content in videos is a crucial task for content segmentation, indexing, and recommendation systems. Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Liang, Mohammad Talebi Kalaleh, Qipei Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated analysis for engineering structures offers considerable potential for boosting efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks. Although AI-driven methods are increasingly common, no systematic framework yet leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic structural analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with structural analysis software. LLMs serve as the core engine: they parse structural descriptions from text and translate them into executable Python scripts. Moreover, the framework integrates the generative capabilities of LLMs with code-based finite element (FE) tools like OpenSeesPy. It employs domain-specific prompt design and in-context learning strategies to enhance the LLM's problem-solving capabilities and generative stability, enabling fully automated structural analysis from descriptive text to model outputs. In our experiments, we introduce a well-curated small-scale benchmark dataset of 20 structural analysis word problems (SAWPs) with ground-truth solutions and evaluate the performance of different LLMs within our framework in solving these SAWPs. The role of system instructions, crafted by structural engineers, is also investigated to understand their impact on LLM-driven structural analysis. Additionally, the generative stability of our framework is examined. Through multiple validation experiments on the benchmark, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can substantially increase the level of automation in solving SAWPs compared to traditional methods. Quantitatively, the framework, built on GPT-4o, achieved 100% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4 (85%), Gemini 1.5 Pro (80%), and Llama-3.3 (30%) on the test examples. Furthermore, integrating domain-specific instructions enhanced performance by 30% on problems with asymmetrical structural configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.
  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhang, Liang Li, St\'ephane Lanteri, Hao Kang, Jiaqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is becoming a popular alternative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they require dedicated manual modifications to the hyperparameters of the network, the sampling methods and loss function weights for different PDEs, which reduces the efficiency of the solvers. In this paper, we pro- pose a general multi-stage framework, i.e. BO-SA-PINNs to alleviate this issue. In the first stage, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to select hyperparameters for the training process, and based on the results of the pre-training, the network architecture, learning rate, sampling points distribution and loss function weights suitable for the PDEs are automatically determined. The proposed hyperparameters search space based on experimental results can enhance the efficiency of BO in identifying optimal hyperparameters. After selecting the appropriate hyperparameters, we incorporate a global self-adaptive (SA) mechanism the second stage. Using the pre-trained model and loss information in the second-stage training, the exponential moving average (EMA) method is employed to optimize the loss function weights, and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D) is used to optimize the sampling points distribution. In the third stage, L-BFGS is used for stable training. In addition, we introduce a new activation function that enables BO-SA-PINNs to achieve higher accuracy. In numerical experiments, we conduct comparative and ablation experiments to verify the performance of the model on Helmholtz, Maxwell, Burgers and high-dimensional Poisson equations. The comparative experiment results show that our model can achieve higher accuracy and fewer iterations in test cases, and the ablation experiments demonstrate the positive impact of every improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximeng Ye, Hongyu Li, Zhen-Guo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper builds up a virtual domain extension (VDE) framework for imposing boundary conditions (BCs) in flow simulation using pre-trained local neural operator (LNO). It creates extended virtual domains to the input function to compensate for the corrosion nature of computational domains during LNO inference, thus turns the implementation of BC into the determination of field values on the extended domain. Several strategies to calculate the field values are proposed and validated in solving numerical examples, including padding operation, direct imposition, pressure symmetry, and optimization by backpropagation, and compared with boundary imposition in traditional solvers. It is found that the large time interval of LNO induces a relatively wide near-boundary domain to be processed, thus imposing BC on only a few nodes near the boundary following the immersed boundary conception in traditional solvers can hardly achieve high accuracy. With appropriate values assigned on the extended virtual domains, VDE can accurately impose BCs and lead to reasonable flow field predictions. This work provides a guidance for imposing BCs reliably in LNO prediction, which could facilitate the reuse of pre-trained LNO in more applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hezhao Liu, Yang Lu, Mengke Li, Yiqun Zhang, Shreyank N Gowda, Chen Gong, Hanzi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress by leveraging both labeled data and unlabeled data. Existing SSL methods overlook a common real-world scenario when labeled data is extremely scarce, potentially as limited as a single labeled sample in the dataset. General SSL approaches struggle to train effectively from scratch under such constraints, while methods utilizing pre-trained models often fail to find an optimal balance between leveraging limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Firstly Adapt, Then catEgorize (FATE), a novel SSL framework tailored for scenarios with extremely limited labeled data. At its core, the two-stage prompt tuning paradigm FATE exploits unlabeled data to compensate for scarce supervision signals, then transfers to downstream tasks. Concretely, FATE first adapts a pre-trained model to the feature distribution of downstream data using volumes of unlabeled samples in an unsupervised manner. It then applies an SSL method specifically designed for pre-trained models to complete the final classification task. FATE is designed to be compatible with both vision and vision-language pre-trained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FATE effectively mitigates challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled samples in SSL, achieving an average performance improvement of 33.74% across seven benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09831">Offline Dynamic Inventory and Pricing Strategy: Addressing Censored and Dependent Demand</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Korel Gundem, Zhengling Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline sequential feature-based pricing and inventory control problem where the current demand depends on the past demand levels and any demand exceeding the available inventory is lost. Our goal is to leverage the offline dataset, consisting of past prices, ordering quantities, inventory levels, covariates, and censored sales levels, to estimate the optimal pricing and inventory control policy that maximizes long-term profit. While the underlying dynamic without censoring can be modeled by Markov decision process (MDP), the primary obstacle arises from the observed process where demand censoring is present, resulting in missing profit information, the failure of the Markov property, and a non-stationary optimal policy. To overcome these challenges, we first approximate the optimal policy by solving a high-order MDP characterized by the number of consecutive censoring instances, which ultimately boils down to solving a specialized Bellman equation tailored for this problem. Inspired by offline reinforcement learning and survival analysis, we propose two novel data-driven algorithms to solving these Bellman equations and, thus, estimate the optimal policy. Furthermore, we establish finite sample regret bounds to validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in estimating the optimal policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven approach to learning optimal pricing and inventory control policies in a sequential decision-making environment characterized by censored and dependent demand. The implementations of the proposed algorithms are available at https://github.com/gundemkorel/Inventory_Pricing_Control</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Darshan Gadginmath, Fabio Pasqualetti</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints. Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward process.
  For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems, we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems, including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating the potential for applying diffusion-inspired techniques in linear, nonlinear, and settings with state space constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Zhang, Derui Wang, Qianyi Yang, Pengyang Huang, Junhan Pu, Yuxin Cao, Kai Ye, Jie Hao, Yixian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech synthesis technology has brought great convenience, while the widespread usage of realistic deepfake audio has triggered hazards. Malicious adversaries may unauthorizedly collect victims' speeches and clone a similar voice for illegal exploitation (\textit{e.g.}, telecom fraud). However, the existing defense methods cannot effectively prevent deepfake exploitation and are vulnerable to robust training techniques. Therefore, a more effective and robust data protection method is urgently needed. In response, we propose a defensive framework, \textit{\textbf{SafeSpeech}}, which protects the users' audio before uploading by embedding imperceptible perturbations on original speeches to prevent high-quality synthetic speech. In SafeSpeech, we devise a robust and universal proactive protection technique, \textbf{S}peech \textbf{PE}rturbative \textbf{C}oncealment (\textbf{SPEC}), that leverages a surrogate model to generate universally applicable perturbation for generative synthetic models. Moreover, we optimize the human perception of embedded perturbation in terms of time and frequency domains. To evaluate our method comprehensively, we conduct extensive experiments across advanced models and datasets, both subjectively and objectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that SafeSpeech achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice protection effectiveness and transferability and is highly robust against advanced adaptive adversaries. Moreover, SafeSpeech has real-time capability in real-world tests. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Irregular embedding lookups are a critical bottleneck in recommender models, sparse large language models, and graph learning models.

Then, we propose the Ember compiler for automatically generating optimized DAE code from PyTorch and TensorFlow. Conversely from other DAE compilers, Ember features multiple intermediate representations specifically designed for different optimization levels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit a classical assumption for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms where the squared norm of the stochastic subgradient (or the variance for smooth problems) is allowed to grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable. We contextualize this assumption in view of its inception in the 1960s, its seemingly independent appearance in the recent literature, its relationship to weakest-known variance assumptions for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms, and its relevance in deterministic problems for non-Lipschitz nonsmooth convex optimization. We build on and extend a connection recently made between this assumption and the Halpern iteration. For convex nonsmooth, and potentially stochastic, optimization, we analyze horizon-free, anytime algorithms with last-iterate rates. For problems beyond simple constrained optimization, such as convex problems with functional constraints or regularized convex-concave min-max problems, we obtain rates for optimality measures that do not require boundedness of the feasible set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katarzyna Filus, Micha{\l} Romaszewski, Mateusz \.Zarski</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding deep neural network (DNN) behavior requires more than evaluating classification accuracy alone; analyzing errors and their predictability is equally crucial. Current evaluation methodologies lack transparency, particularly in explaining the underlying causes of network misclassifications. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that investigates the relationship between the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network and its real-data misclassification patterns. Central to our framework is the Similarity Depth (SD) metric, which quantifies the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network along with a method of evaluation of how closely the network's errors align with its internally perceived similarity structure. We also propose a graph-based visualization of model semantic relationships and misperceptions. A key advantage of our approach is that leveraging class templates -- representations derived from classifier layer weights -- is applicable to already trained networks without requiring additional data or experiments. Our approach reveals that deep vision networks encode specific semantic hierarchies and that high semantic depth improves the compliance between perceived class similarities and actual errors.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph Metzl, Kianusch Vahid Yousefnia, Richard M\"uller, Virginia Poli, Miria Celano, Tobias B\"olle</p>
<p>Abstract: The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long lead times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired lead time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on lead time and wind speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h lead time. We confirm that generally advection becomes gradually more important with longer lead times and higher wind speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML based forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Jiyang Guan, Jian Liang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress, yet their safety alignment remains limited. Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) is a suitable approach for style adaptation of pre-trained robotic behavior: adapting the robot's policy to follow human user preferences while still being able to perform the original task. However, collecting preferences for the adaptation process in robotics is often challenging and time-consuming. In this work we explore the adaptation of pre-trained robots in the low-preference-data regime. We show that, in this regime, recent adaptation approaches suffer from catastrophic reward forgetting (CRF), where the updated reward model overfits to the new preferences, leading the agent to become unable to perform the original task. To mitigate CRF, we propose to enhance the original reward model with a small number of parameters (low-rank matrices) responsible for modeling the preference adaptation. Our evaluation shows that our method can efficiently and effectively adjust robotic behavior to human preferences across simulation benchmark tasks and multiple real-world robotic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inpainting has recently emerged as a valuable and interesting technology to employ in the analysis of medical imaging data, in particular brain MRI. A wide variety of methodologies for inpainting MRI have been proposed and demonstrated on tasks including anomaly detection. In this work we investigate the statistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of subject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image that are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting results when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the contra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the model is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of hemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting model through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on intensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a strong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhu, Chenmien Tan, Pinzhen Chen, Rico Sennrich, Yanlin Zhang, Hanxu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback by serving as proxies for human preferences in aligning large language models. In this paper, we identify a model preference bias in RMs, where they systematically assign disproportionately high scores to responses from certain policy models. This bias distorts ranking evaluations and leads to unfair judgments. To address this issue, we propose a calibration method named CHatbot Arena calibrated Reward Modeling (CHARM) that leverages Elo scores from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard to mitigate RM overvaluation. We also introduce a Mismatch Degree metric to measure this preference bias. Our approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small preference dataset for continued training of the RM. We conduct extensive experiments on reward model benchmarks and human preference alignment. Results demonstrate that our calibrated RMs (1) achieve improved evaluation accuracy on RM-Bench and the Chat-Hard domain of RewardBench, and (2) exhibit a stronger correlation with human preferences by producing scores more closely aligned with Elo rankings. By mitigating model preference bias, our method provides a generalizable and efficient solution for building fairer and more reliable reward models.</p>

In recent times, commonsense reasoning and understanding of various LLMs have been evaluated using text-based tasks. In this work, we argue that a proxy of this understanding can be maintained as a graphical structure that can further help to perform a rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning abilities about various real-world activities. We create an annotation scheme for capturing this implicit knowledge in the form of a graphical structure for 37 daily human activities. We find that the created resource can be used to frame an enormous number of commonsense queries (~ 10^{17}), facilitating rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, recently, the remarkable performance of LLMs has raised questions about whether these models are truly capable of reasoning in the wild and, in general, how reasoning occurs inside these models. In this resource paper, we bridge this gap by proposing design mechanisms that facilitate research in a similar direction. Our findings suggest that the reasoning components are localized in LLMs that play a prominent role in decision-making when prompted with a commonsense query.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominic Broadbent, Nick Whiteley, Robert Allison, Tom Lovett</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of labelled data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a natural metric for comparing conditional distributions. We then derive a consistent estimator for the AMCMD and establish its rate of convergence. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Building on this, we extend the idea of KH to develop Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm that constructs a compressed set targeting the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), a straightforward adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression (via JKH and JKIP) and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Shaosheng Cao, Jiahan Ren, Jiayuan Su, Ruizhe Chen, Yan Zhang, Zhe Xu, Yao Hu, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks with verifiable solutions such as mathematics and coding. However, applying this idea to machine translation (MT), where outputs are flexibly formatted and difficult to automatically evaluate with explicit rules, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first open-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised fine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to guide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the WMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive performance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points. Meanwhile, our MT-R1-Zero-7B-Mix attains a high average score of 62.25 across all metrics, placing it on par with advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, while the MT-R1-Zero-7B-Sem variant achieves state-of-the-art scores on semantic metrics. Moreover, our work exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution MT tasks, robustly supporting multilingual and low-resource settings. Extensive analysis of model behavior across different initializations and reward metrics offers pioneering insight into the critical role of reward design, LLM adaptability, training dynamics, and emergent reasoning patterns within the R1-Zero paradigm for MT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyadeep Pal, Changsheng Wang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erxue Min, Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Min Yang, Xihong Yang, Xin Jia, Yunfang Wu, Hengyi Cai, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern search systems, search engines often suggest relevant queries to users through various panels or components, helping refine their information needs. Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues. Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications. Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference. Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanyuan Pan, Tiansheng Zhou, Bingtao Ma, Yaqi Wang, Jianxiang Zhao, Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Circuit link prediction identifying missing component connections from incomplete netlists is crucial in automating analog circuit design. However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different classes of components. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 15.05% on the SpiceNetlist dataset and 12.01% on the Image2Net dataset over the existing approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collins O. Ogbodo, Timothy J. Rogers, Mattia Dal Borgo, David J. Wagg</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support capabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process. Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.</p>

Being essentially a program synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem domains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different representations are not compared with each other and their performance is not measured across the different domains. In this work, we propose a unified framework, dubbed TinyverseGP (inspired by tinyGP), which provides support to multiple representations and problem domains, including symbolic regression, logic synthesis and policy search.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, autonomous driving has become a popular field of study. As control at tire grip limit is essential during emergency situations, algorithms developed for racecars are useful for road cars too. This paper examines the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the problem of grip limit driving in a simulated environment. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method is used to train an agent to control the steering wheel and pedals of the vehicle, using only visual inputs to achieve professional human lap times. The paper outlines the formulation of the task of time optimal driving on a race track as a deep reinforcement learning problem, and explains the chosen observations, actions, and reward functions. The results demonstrate human-like learning and driving behavior that utilize maximum tire grip potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motion prediction plays an important role in autonomous driving. This study presents LMFormer, a lane-aware transformer network for trajectory prediction tasks. In contrast to previous studies, our work provides a simple mechanism to dynamically prioritize the lanes and shows that such a mechanism introduces explainability into the learning behavior of the network. Additionally, LMFormer uses the lane connection information at intersections, lane merges, and lane splits, in order to learn long-range dependency in lane structure. Moreover, we also address the issue of refining the predicted trajectories and propose an efficient method for iterative refinement through stacked transformer layers. For benchmarking, we evaluate LMFormer on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it achieves SOTA performance across multiple metrics. Furthermore, the Deep Scenario dataset is used to not only illustrate cross-dataset network performance but also the unification capabilities of LMFormer to train on multiple datasets and achieve better performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Characterization of atomic-scale materials traditionally requires human experts with months to years of specialized training. Even for trained human operators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when examining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures. This bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems capable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training datasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical Microscopy & Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that integrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot characterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation model (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT), unsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope control, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through prompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When analyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation accuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human experts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary slits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system retains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color temperature fluctuations, and exposure variations. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of common 2D materials-including graphene, MoS2, WSe2, SnSe-regardless of whether they were fabricated via chemical vapor deposition or mechanical exfoliation. This work represents the implementation of foundation models to achieve autonomous analysis, establishing a scalable and data-efficient characterization paradigm that fundamentally transforms the approach to nanoscale materials research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshan Zhou, Carol C. Menassa, Vineet R. Kamat</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots with wheeled, quadrupedal, or humanoid forms are increasingly integrated into built environments. However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maud Biquard, Marie Chabert, Florence Genin, Christophe Latry, Thomas Oberlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Poisson-Gaussian noise describes the noise of various imaging systems thus the need of efficient algorithms for Poisson-Gaussian image restoration. Deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require sensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting. A promising alternative is given by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, which consist in learning only a regularization through a denoiser, allowing to restore images from several sources with the same network. This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an efficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted from DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation to Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the absence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for the specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step that accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude. Experiments are conducted on satellite image restoration and super-resolution problems. High-resolution realistic Pleiades images are simulated for the experiments, which demonstrate that PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency, which seems promising for on-ground satellite processing chains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Rijal, Caroline M. Holmes, Samantha Petti, Gautam Reddy, Michael M. Desai, Pankaj Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting phenotype from genotype is a central challenge in genetics. Traditional approaches in quantitative genetics typically analyze this problem using methods based on linear regression. These methods generally assume that the genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an additive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases) pairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to analyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment interactions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based models, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language processing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent interactions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein structure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative genetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in predicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of models with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a recent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that our model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes compared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment attention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across multiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for "transfer learning" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to human expert elicitation for extracting structured causal knowledge and facilitating causal modeling in biometric and healthcare applications.
  Material and Methods: LLM-generated causal structures, specifically Bayesian networks (BNs), were benchmarked against traditional statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion) using healthcare datasets. Validation techniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verifying relationships, and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and robustness to compare network structures.
  Results and Discussion: LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than expert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence and precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual constraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from training data require further investigation.
  Conclusion: LLMs represent a novel frontier in expert elicitation for probabilistic causal modeling, promising to improve transparency and reduce uncertainty in the decision-making using such models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific equation discovery is a fundamental task in the history of scientific progress, enabling the derivation of laws governing natural phenomena. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization. Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning. Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jane H. Lee, Anay Mehrotra, Manolis Zampetakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data when the unlabeled data distribution is shifted, which we call Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled (PIU) Learning. In the absence of covariate shifts, i.e., with perfect unlabeled data, Denis (1998) reduced this problem to learning under Massart noise; however, that reduction fails under even slight shifts.
  Our main results on PIU learning are the characterizations of the sample complexity of PIU learning and a computationally and sample-efficient algorithm achieving a misclassification error $\varepsilon$. We further show that our results lead to new algorithms for several related problems.
  1. Learning from smooth distributions: We give algorithms that learn interesting concept classes from only positive samples under smooth feature distributions, bypassing known existing impossibility results and contributing to recent advances in smoothened learning (Haghtalab et al, J.ACM'24) (Chandrasekaran et al., COLT'24).
  2. Learning with a list of unlabeled distributions: We design new algorithms that apply to a broad class of concept classes under the assumption that we are given a list of unlabeled distributions, one of which--unknown to the learner--is $O(1)$-close to the true feature distribution.
  3. Estimation in the presence of unknown truncation: We give the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for estimating the parameters of an exponential family distribution from samples truncated to an unknown set approximable by polynomials in $L_1$-norm. This improves the algorithm by Lee et al. (FOCS'24) that requires approximation in $L_2$-norm.
  4. Detecting truncation: We present new algorithms for detecting whether given samples have been truncated (or not) for a broad class of non-product distributions, including non-product distributions, improving the algorithm by De et al. (STOC'24).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Hao, Jiaming Han, Yiyuan Zhang, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding. However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyu Ye, Haojun Shi, Darren Shih, Hyokun Yun, Tanya Roosta, Tianmin Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: To achieve successful assistance with long-horizon web-based tasks, AI agents must be able to sequentially follow real-world user instructions over a long period. Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Piras, Francesco Sorrenti, Ruth Durrer, Martin Kunz</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $\sim10\%$ using $\sim10^3$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $7\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $10\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $15\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Leng, Jaskirat Singh, Yunzhong Hou, Zhenchang Xing, Saining Xie, Liang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasser Benigmim, Mohammad Fahes, Tuan-Hung Vu, Andrei Bursuc, Raoul de Charette</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) models extend the CLIP model to segmentation while maintaining the use of multiple templates (e.g., a photo of <class>, a sketch of a <class>, etc.) for constructing class-wise averaged text embeddings, acting as a classifier. In this paper, we challenge this status quo and investigate the impact of templates for OVSS. Empirically, we observe that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers significantly outperforming the conventional averaged classifier. We refer to them as class-experts. Given access to unlabeled images and without any training involved, we estimate these experts by leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, selecting as class-wise experts those which yield the lowest entropy. All experts, each specializing in a specific class, collaborate in a newly proposed fusion method to generate more accurate OVSS predictions. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering a ''free lunch'' to systematically improve OVSS without labels and additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLOSS consistently boosts state-of-the-art methods on various OVSS benchmarks. Moreover, the selected expert templates can generalize well from one dataset to others sharing the same semantic categories, yet exhibiting distribution shifts. Additionally, we obtain satisfactory improvements under a low-data regime, where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Chen, Chengyuan Zhang, Xi-Le Zhao, Nicolas Saunier, Lijun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Movement speed data from urban road networks, computed from ridesharing vehicles or taxi trajectories, is often high-dimensional, sparse, and nonstationary (e.g., exhibiting seasonality). To address these challenges, we propose a Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization (NoTMF) model that leverages matrix factorization to project high-dimensional and sparse movement speed data into low-dimensional latent spaces. This results in a concise formula with the multiplication between spatial and temporal factor matrices. To characterize the temporal correlations, NoTMF takes a latent equation on the seasonal differenced temporal factors using higher-order vector autoregression (VAR). This approach not only preserves the low-rank structure of sparse movement speed data but also maintains consistent temporal dynamics, including seasonality information. The learning process for NoTMF involves optimizing the spatial and temporal factor matrices along with a collection of VAR coefficient matrices. To solve this efficiently, we introduce an alternating minimization framework, which tackles a challenging procedure of estimating the temporal factor matrix using conjugate gradient method, as the subproblem involves both partially observed matrix factorization and seasonal differenced VAR. To evaluate the forecasting performance of NoTMF, we conduct extensive experiments on Uber movement speed datasets, which are estimated from ridesharing vehicle trajectories. These datasets contain a large proportion of missing values due to insufficient ridesharing vehicles on the urban road network. Despite the presence of missing data, NoTMF demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy and effectiveness compared to baseline models. Moreover, as the seasonality of movement speed data is of great concern, the experiment results highlight the significance of addressing the nonstationarity of movement speed data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Bai, Tao Luo, Zhi-Qin John Xu, Yaoyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the relation between deep and shallow neural networks is extremely important for the theoretical study of deep learning. In this work, we discover an embedding principle in depth that loss landscape of an NN "contains" all critical points of the loss landscapes for shallower NNs. The key tool for our discovery is the critical lifting operator proposed in this work that maps any critical point of a network to critical manifolds of any deeper network while preserving the outputs. This principle provides new insights to many widely observed behaviors of DNNs. Regarding the easy training of deep networks, we show that local minimum of an NN can be lifted to strict saddle points of a deeper NN. Regarding the acceleration effect of batch normalization, we demonstrate that batch normalization helps avoid the critical manifolds lifted from shallower NNs by suppressing layer linearization. We also prove that increasing training data shrinks the lifted critical manifolds, which can result in acceleration of training as demonstrated in experiments. Overall, our discovery of the embedding principle in depth uncovers the depth-wise hierarchical structure of deep learning loss landscape, which serves as a solid foundation for the further study about the role of depth for DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongtian Zhu, Fengxiang He, Lan Zhang, Zhengyang Niu, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the algorithmic stability and generalizability of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). We prove that the consensus model learned by D-SGD is $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-1}+m^{-1} +\lambda^2)}$-stable in expectation in the non-convex non-smooth setting, where $N$ is the total sample size, $m$ is the worker number, and $1+\lambda$ is the spectral gap that measures the connectivity of the communication topology. These results then deliver an $\mathcal{O}{(N^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+ m^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+\lambda^{1+\alpha} + \phi_{\mathcal{S}})}$ in-average generalization bound, which is non-vacuous even when $\lambda$ is closed to $1$, in contrast to vacuous as suggested by existing literature on the projected version of D-SGD. Our theory indicates that the generalizability of D-SGD is positively correlated with the spectral gap, and can explain why consensus control in initial training phase can ensure better generalization. Experiments of VGG-11 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet justify our theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on the topology-aware generalization of vanilla D-SGD.

We analyze the effect of using different coarse-grained graph resolutions, obtained through the Laplacian renormalization group theory, on node classification tasks. At the theory's core is grouping nodes connected by significant information flow at a given time scale. Representations of the graph at different scales encode interaction information at different ranges. We specifically experiment using representations at the characteristic scale of the graph's mesoscopic structures. We provide the models with the original graph and the graph represented at the characteristic resolution scale and compare them to models that can only access the original graph. Our results showed that models with access to both the original graph and the characteristic scale graph can achieve statistically significant improvements in test accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: For safety, medical AI systems undergo thorough evaluations before deployment, validating their predictions against a ground truth which is assumed to be fixed and certain. However, this ground truth is often curated in the form of differential diagnoses. While a single differential diagnosis reflects the uncertainty in one expert assessment, multiple experts introduce another layer of uncertainty through disagreement. Both forms of uncertainty are ignored in standard evaluation which aggregates these differential diagnoses to a single label. In this paper, we show that ignoring uncertainty leads to overly optimistic estimates of model performance, therefore underestimating risk associated with particular diagnostic decisions. To this end, we propose a statistical aggregation approach, where we infer a distribution on probabilities of underlying medical condition candidates themselves, based on observed annotations. This formulation naturally accounts for the potential disagreements between different experts, as well as uncertainty stemming from individual differential diagnoses, capturing the entire ground truth uncertainty. Our approach boils down to generating multiple samples of medical condition probabilities, then evaluating and averaging performance metrics based on these sampled probabilities. In skin condition classification, we find that a large portion of the dataset exhibits significant ground truth uncertainty and standard evaluation severely over-estimates performance without providing uncertainty estimates. In contrast, our framework provides uncertainty estimates on common metrics of interest such as top-k accuracy and average overlap, showing that performance can change multiple percentage points. We conclude that, while assuming a crisp ground truth can be acceptable for many AI applications, a more nuanced evaluation protocol should be utilized in medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions and performance metrics in deep learning, highlighting key developments and practical insights across diverse application areas. We begin by outlining fundamental considerations in classic tasks such as regression and classification, then extend our analysis to specialized domains like computer vision and natural language processing including retrieval-augmented generation. In each setting, we systematically examine how different loss functions and evaluation metrics can be paired to address task-specific challenges such as class imbalance, outliers, and sequence-level optimization. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a unified framework for understanding how losses and metrics align with different learning objectives, (2) an in-depth discussion of multi-loss setups that balance competing goals, and (3) new insights into specialized metrics used to evaluate modern applications like retrieval-augmented generation, where faithfulness and context relevance are pivotal. Along the way, we highlight best practices for selecting or combining losses and metrics based on empirical behaviors and domain constraints. Finally, we identify open problems and promising directions, including the automation of loss-function search and the development of robust, interpretable evaluation measures for increasingly complex deep learning tasks. Our review aims to equip researchers and practitioners with clearer guidance in designing effective training pipelines and reliable model assessments for a wide spectrum of real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung Hwan Heo, Jeonghoon Kim, Beomseok Kwon, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks. However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to the large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output-channel (per-OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers within a group. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we propose Adaptive Dimensions (AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to +4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/johnheo/adadim-llm</p>

<p>Abstract: The notion of group invariance helps neural networks in recognizing patterns and features under geometric transformations. Group convolutional neural networks enhance traditional convolutional neural networks by incorporating group-based geometric structures into their design. This research studies affine invariance on continuous-domain convolutional neural networks. Despite other research considering isometric invariance or similarity invariance, we focus on the full structure of affine transforms generated by the group of all invertible $2 \times 2$ real matrices (generalized linear group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$). We introduce a new criterion to assess the invariance of two signals under affine transformations. The input image is embedded into the affine Lie group $G_2 = \mathbb{R}^2 \ltimes \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ to facilitate group convolution operations that respect affine invariance. Then, we analyze the convolution of embedded signals over $G_2$. In sum, our research could eventually extend the scope of geometrical transformations that usual deep-learning pipelines can handle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiping Nie, Zhezheng Hao, Rong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Support Vector Machine (SVM) stands out as a prominent machine learning technique widely applied in practical pattern recognition tasks. It achieves binary classification by maximizing the "margin", which represents the minimum distance between instances and the decision boundary. Although many efforts have been dedicated to expanding SVM for multi-class case through strategies such as one versus one and one versus the rest, satisfactory solutions remain to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-class SVM that incorporates pairwise class loss considerations and maximizes the minimum margin. Adhering to this concept, we embrace a new formulation that imparts heightened flexibility to multi-class SVM. Furthermore, the correlations between the proposed method and multiple forms of multi-class SVM are analyzed. The proposed regularizer, akin to the concept of "margin", can serve as a seamless enhancement over the softmax in deep learning, providing guidance for network parameter learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method over existing multi-classification methods.Code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/M3SVM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Sardana, Jacob Portes, Sasha Doubov, Jonathan Frankle</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling laws are empirical formulas that estimate changes in model quality as a result of increasing parameter count and training data. However, these formulas, including the popular Deepmind Chinchilla scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large inference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than Chinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and parameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues to improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000). Finally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law coefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at typical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at these extreme ranges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) describe the temporal evolution of systems that obey both differential and algebraic constraints. Of particular interest are systems that contain implicit relationships between their components, such as conservation relationships. Here, we present an Operator Splitting (OS) numerical integration scheme for learning unknown components of Differential-Algebraic Equations from time-series data. This methodology is built upon the concept of the Universal Differential Equation; that is, a model constructed as a system of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations informed by theory from particular science domains. In this work, we show that the proposed OS-based time-stepping scheme is suitable for relevant system-theoretic data-driven modeling tasks. Presented examples include (i) the inverse problem of tank-manifold dynamics and (ii) discrepancy modeling of a network of pumps, tanks, and pipes. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's robustness to noise and extrapolation ability to (i) learn the behaviors of the system components and their interaction physics and (ii) disambiguate between data trends and mechanistic relationships contained in the system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassine Habchi, Hamza Kheddar, Yassine Himeur, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in developing smart diagnostic systems to help medical experts process extensive data for treating incurable diseases has been notable. In particular, the challenge of identifying thyroid cancer (TC) has seen progress with the use of machine learning (ML) and big data analysis, incorporating Transformers to evaluate TC prognosis and determine the risk of malignancy in individuals. This review article presents a summary of various studies on AI-based approaches, especially those employing Transformers, for diagnosing TC. It introduces a new categorization system for these methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the goals of the framework, and the computing environments used. Additionally, it scrutinizes and contrasts the available TC datasets by their features. The paper highlights the importance of AI instruments in aiding the diagnosis and treatment of TC through supervised, unsupervised, or mixed approaches, with a special focus on the ongoing importance of Transformers and large language models (LLMs) in medical diagnostics and disease management. It further discusses the progress made and the continuing obstacles in this area. Lastly, it explores future directions and focuses within this research field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heqiang Wang, Xiang Liu, Yucheng Liu, Jia Zhou, Weihong Yang, Xiaoxiong Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing number and enhanced capabilities of IoT devices in smart buildings, these devices are evolving beyond basic data collection and control to actively participate in deep learning tasks. Federated Learning (FL), as a decentralized learning paradigm, is well-suited for such scenarios. However, the limited computational and communication resources of IoT devices present significant challenges. While existing research has extensively explored efficiency improvements in Horizontal FL, these techniques cannot be directly applied to Vertical FL due to fundamental differences in data partitioning and model structure. To address this gap, we propose a Lightweight Vertical Federated Learning (LVFL) framework that jointly optimizes computational and communication efficiency. Our approach introduces two distinct lightweighting strategies: one for reducing the complexity of the feature model to improve local computation, and another for compressing feature embeddings to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we derive a convergence bound for the proposed LVFL algorithm that explicitly incorporates both computation and communication lightweighting ratios. Experimental results on an image classification task demonstrate that LVFL effectively mitigates resource demands while maintaining competitive learning performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01614">RULSurv: A probabilistic survival-based method for early censoring-aware prediction of remaining useful life in ball bearings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Marius Lillelund, Fernando Pannullo, Morten Opprud Jakobsen, Manuel Morante, Christian Fischer Pedersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of ball bearings is an active area of research, where novel machine learning techniques are continuously being applied to predict degradation trends and anticipate failures before they occur. However, few studies have explicitly addressed the challenge of handling censored data, where information about a specific event (\eg mechanical failure) is incomplete or only partially observed. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and flexible method for early fault detection using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis that naturally supports censored data. We demonstrate our approach in the XJTU-SY dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy across three different operating conditions. When predicting the time to failure for bearings under the highest load (C1, 12.0 kN and 2100 RPM) with 25% random censoring, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95% CI = 13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and an MAE of 12.6 minutes (95% CI = 11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival Forests model, compared to an MAE of 18.5 minutes (95% CI = 17.4-19.6) using a linear LASSO model that does not support censoring. Moreover, our approach achieves a mean cumulative relative accuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings under the highest load, which improves over several state-of-the-art baselines. Our work highlights the importance of considering censored data as part of the model design when building predictive models for early fault detection and RUL estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Bai, Jiajie Zhao, Yaoyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Matrix factorization models have been extensively studied as a valuable test-bed for understanding the implicit biases of overparameterized models. Although both low nuclear norm and low rank regularization have been studied for these models, a unified understanding of when, how, and why they achieve different implicit regularization effects remains elusive. In this work, we systematically investigate the implicit regularization of matrix factorization for solving matrix completion problems. We empirically discover that the connectivity of observed data plays a crucial role in the implicit bias, with a transition from low nuclear norm to low rank as data shifts from disconnected to connected with increased observations. We identify a hierarchy of intrinsic invariant manifolds in the loss landscape that guide the training trajectory to evolve from low-rank to higher-rank solutions. Based on this finding, we theoretically characterize the training trajectory as following the hierarchical invariant manifold traversal process, generalizing the characterization of Li et al. (2020) to include the disconnected case. Furthermore, we establish conditions that guarantee minimum nuclear norm, closely aligning with our experimental findings, and we provide a dynamics characterization condition for ensuring minimum rank. Our work reveals the intricate interplay between data connectivity, training dynamics, and implicit regularization in matrix factorization models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Bamberger, Federico Barbero, Xiaowen Dong, Michael M. Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Amir, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding - a novel method to embed multisets and measures over R^d into Euclidean space.
  Our proposed embedding approximately preserves the sliced Wasserstein distance on distributions, thereby yielding geometrically meaningful representations that better capture the structure of the input. Moreover, it is injective on measures and bi-Lipschitz on multisets - a significant advantage over prevalent methods based on sum- or max-pooling, which are provably not bi-Lipschitz, and, in many cases, not even injective. The required output dimension for these guarantees is near-optimal: roughly 2Nd, where N is the maximal input multiset size.
  Furthermore, we prove that it is impossible to embed distributions over R^d into Euclidean space in a bi-Lipschitz manner. Thus, the metric properties of our embedding are, in a sense, the best possible.
  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields superior multiset representations that improve performance in practical learning tasks. Specifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with an MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced) Wasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding makes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only minor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Choi, Arash Ahmadian, Matthieu Geist, Oilvier Pietquin, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar</p>
<p>Abstract: Online and offline RLHF methods, such as PPO and DPO, have been highly successful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success, however, these methods suffer from fundamental limitations: (a) Models trained with RLHF can learn from mistakes or negative examples through RL mechanism or contrastive loss during training. However, at inference time, they lack an innate self-improvement mechanism for error corrections. (b) The optimal solution of existing methods is highly task-dependent, making it difficult for them to generalize to new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization (SRPO), a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework. The key idea behind SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, mathematically formulated as a min-max objective that jointly optimizes a self-improvement policy and a generative policy in an adversarial fashion. Crucially, the solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task, which makes it robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be reformulated as a non-adversarial offline loss, which can be efficiently optimized using standard supervised learning techniques at scale. To demonstrate SRPO's effectiveness, we evaluate it using AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. When tested on the XSum dataset, SRPO outperforms DPO by a margin of 15% after 5 self revisions, achieving an impressive 90% WR. Moreover, on the challenging Arena-Hard prompts, SRPO outperforms both DPO and IPO (by 4% without revision and 6% after a single revision), reaching a 56% WR against against Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Hasan Shahriar, Ning Wang, Naren Ramakrishnan, Y. Thomas Hou, Wenjing Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential adoption of machine learning (ML) is propelling the world into a future of distributed and intelligent automation and data-driven solutions. However, the proliferation of malicious data manipulation attacks against ML, namely adversarial and backdoor attacks, jeopardizes its reliability in safety-critical applications. The existing detection methods are attack-specific and built upon some strong assumptions, limiting them in diverse practical scenarios. Thus, motivated by the need for a more robust, unified, and attack-agnostic defense mechanism, we first investigate the shared traits of adversarial and backdoor attacks. Based on our observation, we propose NoiSec, a reconstruction-based intrusion detection system that brings a novel perspective by shifting focus from the reconstructed input to the reconstruction noise itself, which is the foundational root cause of such malicious data alterations. NoiSec disentangles the noise from the test input, extracts the underlying features from the noise, and leverages them to recognize systematic malicious manipulation. Our comprehensive evaluation of NoiSec demonstrates its high effectiveness across various datasets, including basic objects, natural scenes, traffic signs, medical images, spectrogram-based audio data, and wireless sensing against five state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and three backdoor attacks under challenging evaluation conditions. NoiSec demonstrates strong detection performance in both white-box and black-box adversarial attack scenarios, significantly outperforming the closest baseline models, particularly in an adaptive attack setting. We will provide the code for future baseline comparison. Our code and artifacts are publicly available at https://github.com/shahriar0651/NoiSec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Gai\'nski, Micha{\l} Koziarski, Krzysztof Maziarz, Marwin Segler, Jacek Tabor, Marek \'Smieja</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-step retrosynthesis aims to predict a set of reactions that lead to the creation of a target molecule, which is a crucial task in molecular discovery. Although a target molecule can often be synthesized with multiple different reactions, it is not clear how to verify the feasibility of a reaction, because the available datasets cover only a tiny fraction of the possible solutions. Consequently, the existing models are not encouraged to explore the space of possible reactions sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel single-step retrosynthesis model, RetroGFN, that can explore outside the limited dataset and return a diverse set of feasible reactions by leveraging a feasibility proxy model during the training. We show that RetroGFN achieves competitive results on standard top-k accuracy while outperforming existing methods on round-trip accuracy. Moreover, we provide empirical arguments in favor of using round-trip accuracy, which expands the notion of feasibility with respect to the standard top-k accuracy metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Lin, Shuchang Liu, Chuyuan Wang, Yongqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting watch time is crucial for optimizing recommendations and user experience in short video platforms. However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch-time prediction and user engagement modeling. Specifically, deploying CQE online on a large-scale platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users has led to substantial gains in key evaluation metrics, including active days, engagement time, and video views. These results highlight the practical impact of our proposed approach in enhancing the user experience and overall performance of the short video recommendation system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghyun Choi, Hye Yoon Lee, Dain Kwon, SunJong Park, Kyuyeun Kim, Noseong Park, Jonghyun Choi, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we observe that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From this observation, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that enhances inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention outputs from each spatial query patch. Then, we align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher by applying head-wise structural attention distillation. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ViT-DFQ. This paper is an extended version of our work published in the proceedings of AAAI 2025, including additional supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md-Ferdous Pervej, Minseok Choi, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
<p>Abstract: While federated learning (FL) is a widely popular distributed machine learning (ML) strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous configurations of the wireless devices pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called online-score-aided federated learning (OSAFL), specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since clients' local training steps differ under resource constraints, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm without incurring any communication overheads to the clients or requiring any statistical data information from them. Our extensive simulation results on two different datasets with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to five modified state-of-the-art FL baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse van Remmerden, Zaharah Bukhsh, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions, and often yields suboptimal results compared to traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP). We introduce Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch (Offline-LD), which addresses these limitations by learning from previously generated solutions. Our approach is motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions are available, although our current evaluation focuses on benchmark problems. Offline-LD adapts two CQL-based Q-learning methods (mQRDQN and discrete mSAC) for maskable action spaces, introduces a novel entropy bonus modification for discrete SAC, and exploits reward normalization through preprocessing. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances. Notably, by introducing noise into the expert dataset, we achieve similar or better results than those obtained from the expert dataset, suggesting that a more diverse training set is preferable because it contains counterfactual information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amortized inference is the task of training a parametric model, such as a neural network, to approximate a distribution with a given unnormalized density where exact sampling is intractable. When sampling is implemented as a sequential decision-making process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as generative flow networks, can be used to train the sampling policy. Off-policy RL training facilitates the discovery of diverse, high-reward candidates, but existing methods still face challenges in efficient exploration. We propose to use an adaptive training distribution (the \teacher) to guide the training of the primary amortized sampler (the \student). The \teacher, an auxiliary behavior model, is trained to sample high-loss regions of the \student and can generalize across unexplored modes, thereby enhancing mode coverage by providing an efficient training curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in a synthetic environment designed to present an exploration challenge, two diffusion-based sampling tasks, and four biochemical discovery tasks demonstrating its ability to improve sample efficiency and mode coverage.

In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under reasonable assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in the dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Andrae, Tomas Landelius, Joel Oskarsson, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Yaoru Sun, Zeshen Tang, Haibo Shi, Chenyuan Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) decomposes complex reaching tasks into a sequence of simple subgoal-conditioned tasks, showing significant promise for addressing long-horizon planning in large-scale environments. This paper bridges the goal-conditioned HRL based on graph-based planning to brain mechanisms, proposing a hippocampus-striatum-like dual-controller hypothesis. Inspired by the brain mechanisms of organisms (i.e., the high-reward preferences observed in hippocampal replay) and instance-based theory, we propose a high-return sampling strategy for constructing memory graphs, improving sample efficiency. Additionally, we derive a model-free lower-level Q-function gradient penalty to resolve the model dependency issues present in prior work, improving the generalization of Lipschitz constraints in applications. Finally, we integrate these two extensions, High-reward Graph and model-free Gradient Penalty (HG2P), into the state-of-the-art framework ACLG, proposing a novel goal-conditioned HRL framework, HG2P+ACLG. Experimentally, the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL algorithms on a variety of long-horizon navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11709">GeOT: A spatially explicit framework for evaluating spatio-temporal predictions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Wiedemann, Th\'eo Uscidda, Martin Raubal</p>
<p>Abstract: When predicting observations across space and time, the spatial layout of errors impacts a model's real-world utility. For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Jia, Jiancheng Liu, Yihua Zhang, Parikshit Ram, Nathalie Baracaldo, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. Despite growing interest of LLM unlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyas Obbad, Iddah Mlauzi, Brando Miranda, Rylan Schaeffer, Kamal Obbad, Suhana Bedi, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection is crucial for optimizing language model (LM) performance on specific tasks, yet most existing methods fail to effectively consider the target task distribution.
  Current approaches either ignore task-specific requirements entirely or rely on approximations that fail to capture the nuanced patterns needed for tasks like Autoformalization or code generation.
  Methods that do consider the target distribution often rely on simplistic, sometimes noisy, representations, like hashed n-gram features, which can lead to collisions and introduce noise.
  We introduce ZIP-FIT, a data selection framework that uses gzip compression to directly measure alignment between potential training data and the target task distribution.
  In extensive evaluations on Autoformalization and Python code generation, ZIP-FIT significantly outperforms leading baselines like DSIR and D4.
  Models trained on ZIP-FIT-selected data achieve their lowest cross-entropy loss up to 85.1\% faster than baselines, demonstrating that better task alignment leads to more efficient learning.
  In addition, ZIP-FIT performs selection up to 65.8\% faster than DSIR and two orders of magnitude faster than D4.
  Notably, ZIP-FIT shows that smaller, well-aligned datasets often outperform larger but less targeted ones, demonstrating that a small amount of higher quality data is superior to a large amount of lower quality data.
  Our results imply that task-aware data selection is crucial for efficient domain adaptation, and that compression offers a principled way to measure task alignment.
  By showing that targeted data selection can dramatically improve task-specific performance, our work provides new insights into the relationship between data quality, task alignment, and model learning efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ihor Neporozhnii, Julien Roy, Emmanuel Bengio, Jason Hartford</p>
<p>Abstract: In drug discovery, highly automated high-throughput laboratories are used to screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These experiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost by only experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that interrupts the acquisition loop when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in experimental cost while retaining high system performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyang Li, Caesar Wu, Mohammed Chadli, Said Mammar, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) uses multiple nodes to accelerate training, enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered.
  In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilien Bir\'e, Anthony Kobanda, Ludovic Denoyer, R\'emy Portelas</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing agents for complex and underspecified tasks, where no clear objective exists, remains challenging but offers many opportunities. This is especially true in video games, where simulated players (bots) need to play realistically, and there is no clear reward to evaluate them. While imitation learning has shown promise in such domains, these methods often fail when agents encounter out-of-distribution scenarios during deployment. Expanding the training dataset is a common solution, but it becomes impractical or costly when relying on human demonstrations. This article addresses active imitation learning, aiming to trigger expert intervention only when necessary, reducing the need for constant expert input along training. We introduce Random Network Distillation DAgger (RND-DAgger), a new active imitation learning method that limits expert querying by using a learned state-based out-of-distribution measure to trigger interventions. This approach avoids frequent expert-agent action comparisons, thus making the expert intervene only when it is useful. We evaluate RND-DAgger against traditional imitation learning and other active approaches in 3D video games (racing and third-person navigation) and in a robotic locomotion task and show that RND-DAgger surpasses previous methods by reducing expert queries. https://sites.google.com/view/rnd-dagger</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Chen, Qiaobo Li, Arindam Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining gradient compression methods (e.g., CountSketch, quantization) and adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) is a desirable goal in federated learning (FL), with potential benefits on both fewer communication rounds and less per-round communication. In spite of the preliminary empirical success of sketched adaptive methods, existing convergence analyses show the communication cost to have a linear dependence on the ambient dimension, i.e., number of parameters, which is prohibitively high for modern deep learning models. In this work, we introduce specific sketched adaptive federated learning (SAFL) algorithms and, as our main contribution, provide theoretical convergence analyses in different FL settings with guarantees on communication cost depending only logarithmically (instead of linearly) on the ambient dimension. Unlike existing analyses, we show that the entry-wise sketching noise existent in the preconditioners and the first moments of SAFL can be implicitly addressed by leveraging the recently-popularized anisotropic curvatures in deep learning losses, e.g., fast decaying loss Hessian eigen-values. In the i.i.d. client setting of FL, we show that SAFL achieves asymptotic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence, and converges faster in the initial epochs. In the non-i.i.d. client setting, where non-adaptive methods lack convergence guarantees, we show that SACFL (SAFL with clipping) algorithms can provably converge in spite of the additional heavy-tailed noise. Our theoretical claims are supported by empirical studies on vision and language tasks, and in both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Surprisingly, as a by-product of our analysis, the proposed SAFL methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art communication-efficient federated learning algorithms based on error feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jared Fernandez, Luca Wehrstedt, Leonid Shamis, Mostafa Elhoushi, Kalyan Saladi, Yonatan Bisk, Emma Strubell, Jacob Kahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Dramatic increases in the capabilities of neural network models in recent years are driven by scaling model size, training data, and corresponding computational resources. To develop the exceedingly large networks required in modern applications, such as large language models (LLMs), model training is distributed across tens of thousands of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs), requiring orchestration of computation and communication across large computing clusters. In this work, we demonstrate that careful consideration of hardware configuration and parallelization strategy is critical for effective (i.e. compute- and cost-efficient) scaling of model size, training data, and total computation. We conduct an extensive empirical study of the performance of large-scale LLM training workloads across model size, hardware configurations, and distributed parallelization strategies. We demonstrate that: (1) beyond certain scales, overhead incurred from certain distributed communication strategies leads parallelization strategies previously thought to be sub-optimal in fact become preferable; and (2) scaling the total number of accelerators for large model training quickly yields diminishing returns even when hardware and parallelization strategies are properly optimized, implying poor marginal performance per additional unit of power or GPU-hour.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanaz Mahmoodi Takaghaj, Jack Sampson</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiron Thalagala, Pak Kin Wong, Xiaozheng Wang, Tianang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of continuous control, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) demonstrates promising results. However, the dependence of DRL on deep neural networks (DNNs) results in the demand for extensive data and increased computational cost. To address this issue, a novel hybrid actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced. The proposed framework integrates the broad learning system (BLS) with DNN, aiming to merge the strengths of both distinct architectural paradigms. Specifically, the critic network employs BLS for rapid value estimation via ridge regression, while the actor network retains the DNN structure to optimize policy gradients. This hybrid design is generalizable and can enhance existing actor-critic algorithms. To demonstrate its versatility, the proposed framework is integrated into three widely used actor-critic algorithms -- deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), soft actor-critic (SAC), and twin delayed DDPG (TD3), resulting in BLS-augmented variants. Experimental results reveal that all BLS-enhanced versions surpass their original counterparts in terms of training efficiency and accuracy. These improvements highlight the suitability of the proposed framework for real-time control scenarios, where computational efficiency and rapid adaptation are critical.</p>

Our key contribution is providing a positive example of using a transformer to train a deep neural network by gradient descent in an implicit fashion via ICL. Specifically, we provide an explicit construction of a $(2N+4)L$-layer transformer capable of simulating $L$ gradient descent steps of an $N$-layer ReLU network through ICL. We also give the theoretical guarantees for the approximation within any given error and the convergence of the ICL gradient descent. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the more practical setting using Softmax-based transformers. We validate our findings on synthetic datasets for 3-layer, 4-layer, and 6-layer neural networks. The results show that ICL performance matches that of direct training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qi, Shihong Yuan, Yulin Yuan, Linling Kuang, Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Xiangming Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding adversarial examples is crucial for improving model robustness, as they introduce imperceptible perturbations to deceive models. Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more robust models by eliminating model singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to simulate generator dynamics. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability in black-box attacks by tuning the noise parameters during training. Experiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more effective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while preserving better perceptual quality than baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Gong, Akshat Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Tempel, Daniel Groos, Espen Alexander F. Ihlen, Lars Adde, Inga Str\"umke</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models using eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques has become essential to make them more transparent and trustworthy. This is especially important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where understanding model decisions is critical to ensure ethical, sound, and trustworthy outcome predictions. However, users are often confused about which explanability method to choose for their specific use case. We present a comparative analysis of widely used explainability methods, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), within the domain of human activity recognition (HAR) utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs). By evaluating these methods on skeleton-based data from two real-world datasets, including a healthcare-critical cerebral palsy (CP) case, this study provides vital insights into both approaches' strengths, limitations, and differences, offering a roadmap for selecting the most appropriate explanation method based on specific models and applications. We quantitatively and quantitatively compare these methods, focusing on feature importance ranking, interpretability, and model sensitivity through perturbation experiments. While SHAP provides detailed input feature attribution, Grad-CAM delivers faster, spatially oriented explanations, making both methods complementary depending on the application's requirements. Given the importance of XAI in enhancing trust and transparency in ML models, particularly in sensitive environments like healthcare, our research demonstrates how SHAP and Grad-CAM could complement each other to provide more interpretable and actionable model explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Watch time prediction (WTP) has emerged as a pivotal task in short video recommendation systems, designed to quantify user engagement through continuous interaction modeling. Predicting users' watch times on videos often encounters fundamental challenges, including wide value ranges and imbalanced data distributions, which can lead to significant estimation bias when directly applying regression techniques. Recent studies have attempted to address these issues by converting the continuous watch time estimation into an ordinal regression task. While these methods demonstrate partial effectiveness, they exhibit notable limitations: (1) the discretization process frequently relies on bucket partitioning, inherently reducing prediction flexibility and accuracy and (2) the interdependencies among different partition intervals remain underutilized, missing opportunities for effective error correction.
  Inspired by language modeling paradigms, we propose a novel Generative Regression (GR) framework that reformulates WTP as a sequence generation task. Our approach employs \textit{structural discretization} to enable nearly lossless value reconstruction while maintaining prediction fidelity. Through carefully designed vocabulary construction and label encoding schemes, each watch time is bijectively mapped to a token sequence. To mitigate the training-inference discrepancy caused by teacher-forcing, we introduce a \textit{curriculum learning with embedding mixup} strategy that gradually transitions from guided to free-generation modes. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches on two public datasets and one industrial dataset. We also perform online A/B testing on the Kuaishou App to confirm the real-world effectiveness. The results conclusively show that GR outperforms existing techniques significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Yang, Enming Liang, Zicheng Su, Zhichao Zou, Peng Zhen, Jiecheng Guo, Wanjing Ma, Kun An</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) offers an end-to-end approach to the predict-then-optimize (PO) framework by training predictive models directly on decision loss (DL), enhancing decision-making performance within PO contexts. However, the implementation of DFL poses distinct challenges. Primarily, DL can result in deviation from the physical significance of the predictions under limited data. Additionally, some predictive models are non-differentiable or black-box, which cannot be adjusted using gradient-based methods. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decision-Focused Fine-tuning (DFF), which embeds the DFL module into the PO pipeline via a novel bias correction module. DFF is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that maintains the proximity of the DL-enhanced model to the original predictive model within a defined trust region. We theoretically prove that DFF strictly confines prediction bias within a predetermined upper bound, even with limited datasets, thereby substantially reducing prediction shifts caused by DL under limited data. Furthermore, the bias correction module can be integrated into diverse predictive models, enhancing adaptability to a broad range of PO tasks. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, including network flow, portfolio optimization, and resource allocation problems with different predictive models, demonstrate that DFF not only improves decision performance but also adheres to fine-tuning constraints, showcasing robust adaptability across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KaiHui Huang, RunQing Wu, JinHui Shen, HanYi Zhang, Ling Ge, JiGuo Yu, Fei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a pivotal area of research, primarily due to its advantageous characteristic that allows models to persistently acquire and retain information. However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we address network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process, The proposed ARO approach can relieve the over-regularization problem and promote the future task learning. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In view of the gap in the current large language model in sharing memory across dialogues, this research proposes a wormhole memory module (WMM) to realize memory as a Rubik's cube that can be arbitrarily retrieved between different dialogues. Through simulation experiments, the researcher built an experimental framework based on the Python environment and used setting memory barriers to simulate the current situation where memories between LLMs dialogues are difficult to share. The CoQA development data set was imported into the experiment, and the feasibility of its cross-dialogue memory retrieval function was verified for WMM's nonlinear indexing and dynamic retrieval, and a comparative analysis was conducted with the capabilities of Titans and MemGPT memory modules. Experimental results show that WMM demonstrated the ability to retrieve memory across dialogues and the stability of quantitative indicators in eight experiments. It contributes new technical approaches to the optimization of memory management of LLMs and provides experience for the practical application in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Abolfazli, Zekun Song, Avishek Anand, Wolfgang Nejdl</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqiang Huang, Zerui Shao, Ziyuan Yang, Zexin Lu, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile and Web-of-Things (WoT) devices at the network edge generate vast amounts of data for machine learning applications, yet privacy concerns hinder centralized model training. Federated Learning (FL) allows clients (devices) to collaboratively train a shared model coordinated by a central server without transfer private data, but inherent statistical heterogeneity among clients presents challenges, often leading to a dilemma between clients' needs for personalized local models and the server's goal of building a generalized global model. Existing FL methods typically prioritize either global generalization or local personalization, resulting in a trade-off between these two objectives and limiting the full potential of diverse client data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously enhances global generalization and local personalization by Rethinking Information Representation in the Federated learning process (FedRIR). Specifically, we introduce Masked Client-Specific Learning (MCSL), which isolates and extracts fine-grained client-specific features tailored to each client's unique data characteristics, thereby enhancing personalization. Concurrently, the Information Distillation Module (IDM) refines the global shared features by filtering out redundant client-specific information, resulting in a purer and more robust global representation that enhances generalization. By integrating the refined global features with the isolated client-specific features, we construct enriched representations that effectively capture both global patterns and local nuances, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks on the client.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Dong, Yicheng Li, Yunai Li, Jason D. Lee, Qi Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported with experiments on synthetic regression and real vision and NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Chen, Naoki Kiyohara, Harrison Bo Hua Zhu, Yingzhen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online regression setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression (OHSGPR), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SGPR inducing points to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate our method on time series regression tasks, showing that it outperforms the existing online GP method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525">Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Diakonikolas, Giannis Iakovidis, Daniel M. Kane, Nikos Zarifis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists. As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjin Huang, Haotian Hu, Zhenyu Zhang, Gaojie Jin, Xiang Li, Li Shen, Tianlong Chen, Lu Liu, Qingsong Wen, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm statistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Havrilla, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models ($\textbf{LLMs}$) have emerged as a powerful method for discovery. Instead of utilizing numerical data, LLMs utilize associated variable $\textit{semantic metadata}$ to predict variable relationships. Simultaneously, LLMs demonstrate impressive abilities to act as black-box optimizers when given an objective $f$ and sequence of trials. We study LLMs at the intersection of these two capabilities by applying LLMs to the task of $\textit{interactive graph discovery}$: given a ground truth graph $G^*$ capturing variable relationships and a budget of $I$ edge experiments over $R$ rounds, minimize the distance between the predicted graph $\hat{G}_R$ and $G^*$ at the end of the $R$-th round. To solve this task we propose $\textbf{IGDA}$, a LLM-based pipeline incorporating two key components: 1) an LLM uncertainty-driven method for edge experiment selection 2) a local graph update strategy utilizing binary feedback from experiments to improve predictions for unselected neighboring edges. Experiments on eight different real-world graphs show our approach often outperforms all baselines including a state-of-the-art numerical method for interactive graph discovery. Further, we conduct a rigorous series of ablations dissecting the impact of each pipeline component. Finally, to assess the impact of memorization, we apply our interactive graph discovery strategy to a complex, new (as of July 2024) causal graph on protein transcription factors, finding strong performance in a setting where memorization is impossible. Overall, our results show IGDA to be a powerful method for graph discovery complementary to existing numerically driven approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning systems has raised critical concerns about fairness and bias, making mitigating harmful biases essential for AI development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between fairness improvement and the removal of harmful biases in neural networks applied to computer vision tasks. First, we introduce a set of novel XAI-based metrics that analyze saliency maps to assess shifts in a model's decision-making process. Then, we demonstrate that successful debiasing methods systematically redirect model focus away from protected attributes. Additionally, we show that techniques originally developed for artifact removal can be effectively repurposed for fairness. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring that models are fair for the right reasons, contributing to the development of more ethical and trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is emerging as a cost-effective solution necessary to meet the increasing data demands of AI development, created either from existing knowledge or derived from real data. The traditional classification of synthetic data types into hybrid, partial or fully synthetic datasets has limited value and does not reflect the ever-increasing methods to generate synthetic data. The generation method and their source jointly shape the characteristics of synthetic data, which in turn determines its practical applications. We make a case for an alternative approach to grouping synthetic data types that better reflect privacy perspectives in order to facilitate regulatory guidance in the generation and processing of synthetic data. This approach to classification provides flexibility to new advancements like deep generative methods and offers a more practical framework for future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joana Sim\~oes, Jo\~ao Correia</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) gained popularity due to the increased demand for Machine Learning (ML) specialists, allowing them to apply ML techniques effortlessly and quickly. AutoML implementations use optimisation methods to identify the most effective ML solution for a given dataset, aiming to improve one or more predefined metrics. However, most implementations focus on model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Despite being an important factor in obtaining high-performance ML systems, data quality is usually an overlooked part of AutoML and continues to be a manual and time-consuming task. This work presents EDCA, an Evolutionary Data Centric AutoML framework. In addition to the traditional tasks such as selecting the best models and hyperparameters, EDCA enhances the given data by optimising data processing tasks such as data reduction and cleaning according to the problems' needs. All these steps create an ML pipeline that is optimised by an evolutionary algorithm. To assess its effectiveness, EDCA was compared to FLAML and TPOT, two frameworks at the top of the AutoML benchmarks. The frameworks were evaluated in the same conditions using datasets from AMLB classification benchmarks. EDCA achieved statistically similar results in performance to FLAML and TPOT but used significantly less data to train the final solutions. Moreover, EDCA experimental results reveal that a good performance can be achieved using less data and efficient ML algorithm aspects that align with Green AutoML guidelines</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Shen, Aliyah Hsu, Abhineet Agarwal, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBM) aim to improve model interpretability by predicting human level "concepts" in a bottleneck within a deep learning model architecture. However, how the predicted concepts are used in predicting the target still either remains black-box or is simplified to maintain interpretability at the cost of prediction performance. We propose to use Fast Interpretable Greedy Sum-Trees (FIGS) to obtain Binary Distillation (BD). This new method, called FIGS-BD, distills a binary-augmented concept-to-target portion of the CBM into an interpretable tree-based model, while maintaining the competitive prediction performance of the CBM teacher. FIGS-BD can be used in downstream tasks to explain and decompose CBM predictions into interpretable binary-concept-interaction attributions and guide adaptive test-time intervention. Across 4 datasets, we demonstrate that our adaptive test-time intervention identifies key concepts that significantly improve performance for realistic human-in-the-loop settings that only allow for limited concept interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Gong, Yanjun Zhang, Leo Yu Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Yong Xiang, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Ranking Learning (FRL) is a state-of-the-art FL framework that stands out for its communication efficiency and resilience to poisoning attacks. It diverges from the traditional FL framework in two ways: 1) it leverages discrete rankings instead of gradient updates, significantly reducing communication costs and limiting the potential space for malicious updates, and 2) it uses majority voting on the server side to establish the global ranking, ensuring that individual updates have minimal influence since each client contributes only a single vote. These features enhance the system's scalability and position FRL as a promising paradigm for FL training.
  However, our analysis reveals that FRL is not inherently robust, as certain edges are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Through a theoretical investigation, we prove the existence of these vulnerable edges and establish a lower bound and an upper bound for identifying them in each layer. Based on this finding, we introduce a novel local model poisoning attack against FRL, namely the Vulnerable Edge Manipulation (VEM) attack. The VEM attack focuses on identifying and perturbing the most vulnerable edges in each layer and leveraging an optimization-based approach to maximize the attack's impact. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our attack achieves an overall 53.23% attack impact and is 3.7x more impactful than existing methods. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in ranking-based FL systems and underline the urgency for the development of new robust FL frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Liu, Dong Gong, Erdun Gao, Zhen Zhang, Biwei Huang, Mingming Gong, Anton van den Hengel, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result: the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also strongly reinforces the linear representation hypothesis, which posits that LLMs learn linear representations of human-interpretable concepts. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannes Waclawek, Stefan Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores an extension of machine learning-optimized piecewise polynomial approximation by incorporating energy optimization as an additional objective. Traditional closed-form solutions enable continuity and approximation targets but lack flexibility in accommodating complex optimization goals. By leveraging modern gradient descent optimizers within TensorFlow, we introduce a framework that minimizes elastic strain energy in cam profiles, leading to smoother motion. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating its potential to Pareto-efficiently trade approximation quality against energy consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil Ksi\k{a}\.zek, Hubert Jastrz\k{e}bski, Bartosz Trojan, Krzysztof Pniaczek, Micha{\l} Karp, Jacek Tabor</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of deep learning models to learn continuously is essential for adapting to new data categories and evolving data distributions. In recent years, approaches leveraging frozen feature extractors after an initial learning phase have been extensively studied. Many of these methods estimate per-class covariance matrices and prototypes based on backbone-derived feature representations. Within this paradigm, we introduce FeNeC (Feature Neighborhood Classifier) and FeNeC-Log, its variant based on the log-likelihood function. Our approach generalizes the existing concept by incorporating data clustering to capture greater intra-class variability. Utilizing the Mahalanobis distance, our models classify samples either through a nearest neighbor approach or trainable logit values assigned to consecutive classes. Our proposition may be reduced to the existing approaches in a special case while extending them with the ability of more flexible adaptation to data. We demonstrate that two FeNeC variants achieve competitive performance in scenarios where task identities are unknown and establish state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoud Hashemi, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Jishnu Sethumadhavan Nair, Aman Tiwari, Vikas Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanpeng Zhou, Yongyi Yang, Jie Ren, Mahito Sugiyama, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks is a central topic in the deep learning community. In this paper, we take an empirical perspective to study the learning dynamics of neural networks in real-world settings. Specifically, we investigate the evolution process of the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) during training. Our key findings reveal a two-phase learning process: i) in Phase I, the eNTK evolves significantly, signaling the rich regime, and ii) in Phase II, the eNTK keeps evolving but is constrained in a narrow space, a phenomenon we term the cone effect. This two-phase framework builds on the hypothesis proposed by Fort et al. (2020), but we uniquely identify the cone effect in Phase II, demonstrating its significant performance advantages over fully linearized training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Chen Wang, Antoine De Comite, Alexandra Voloshina, Monica Daley, Nidhi Seethapathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling human movement in real-world tasks is a fundamental goal for motor control, biomechanics, and rehabilitation engineering. However, existing models of essential tasks like locomotion are not applicable across varying terrain, mechanical conditions, and sensory contexts. This is at least in part due to simplifying assumptions like linear and fixed timescales mappings between inputs and future actions, which may not be broadly applicable. Here, we develop a deep learning-based framework for action prediction, outperforming traditional models across multiple contexts (walking and running, treadmill and overground, varying terrains) and input modalities (multiple body states, visual gaze). We find that neural network architectures with flexible input history-dependence, like GRU and Transformer, and with architecture-dependent trial embeddings perform best overall. By quantifying the model's predictions relative to an autoregressive baseline, we identify context- and modality-dependent timescales. These analyses reveal that there is greater reliance on fast-timescale predictions in complex terrain, gaze predicts future foot placement before body states, and the full-body state predictions precede those by center-of-mass states. This deep learning framework for human action prediction provides quantifiable insights into the control of real-world locomotion and can be extended to other actions, contexts, and populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungkyoo Shin, Bumsoo Kim, Eunwoo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal understanding plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence by enabling models to jointly interpret inputs from different modalities. However, conventional approaches such as contrastive learning often struggle with modality discrepancies, leading to potential misalignments. In this paper, we propose a novel class anchor alignment approach that leverages class probability distributions for multi-modal representation learning. Our method, Class-anchor-ALigned generative Modeling (CALM), encodes class anchors as prompts to generate and align class probability distributions for each modality, enabling more effective alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-modal probabilistic variational autoencoder to model uncertainty in the alignment, enhancing the ability to capture deeper relationships between modalities and data variations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in out-of-domain evaluations. This highlights its superior generalization capabilities in multi-modal representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Lenders, Andrea Pugnana, Roberto Pellungrini, Toon Calders, Dino Pedreschi, Fosca Giannotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstaining classifiers have the option to refrain from providing a prediction for instances that are difficult to classify. The abstention mechanism is designed to trade off the classifier's performance on the accepted data while ensuring a minimum number of predictions. In this setting, often fairness concerns arise when the abstention mechanism solely reduces errors for the majority groups of the data, resulting in increased performance differences across demographic groups. While there exist a bunch of methods that aim to reduce discrimination when abstaining, there is no mechanism that can do so in an explainable way. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing Interpretable and Fair Abstaining Classifier IFAC, an algorithm that can reject predictions both based on their uncertainty and their unfairness. By rejecting possibly unfair predictions, our method reduces error and positive decision rate differences across demographic groups of the non-rejected data. Since the unfairness-based rejections are based on an interpretable-by-design method, i.e., rule-based fairness checks and situation testing, we create a transparent process that can empower human decision-makers to review the unfair predictions and make more just decisions for them. This explainable aspect is especially important in light of recent AI regulations, mandating that any high-risk decision task should be overseen by human experts to reduce discrimination risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Diego Zapata-Rivera, Carol Forsyth, Yang Jiang, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser</p>
<p>Abstract: Learner performance data collected by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), such as responses to questions, is essential for modeling and predicting learners' knowledge states. However, missing responses due to skips or incomplete attempts create data sparsity, challenging accurate assessment and personalized instruction. To address this, we propose a generative imputation approach using Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN). Our method features a three-dimensional (3D) framework (learners, questions, and attempts), flexibly accommodating various sparsity levels. Enhanced by convolutional neural networks and optimized with a least squares loss function, the GAIN-based method aligns input and output dimensions to question-attempt matrices along the learners' dimension. Extensive experiments using datasets from AutoTutor Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC), ASSISTments, and MATHia demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms tensor factorization and alternative GAN methods in imputation accuracy across different attempt scenarios. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) further validates the effectiveness of the imputed data by estimating learning parameters: initial knowledge (P(L0)), learning rate (P(T)), guess rate (P(G)), and slip rate (P(S)). Results indicate the imputed data enhances model fit and closely mirrors original distributions, capturing underlying learning behaviors reliably. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence assessments confirm minimal divergence, showing the imputed data preserves essential learning characteristics effectively. These findings underscore GAIN's capability as a robust imputation tool in ITSs, alleviating data sparsity and supporting adaptive, individualized instruction, ultimately leading to more precise and responsive learner assessments and improved educational outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattia Opper, Roland Fernandez, Paul Smolensky, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lina Wang, Yunsheng Yuan, Chunxiao Wang, Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborates to learn a global model using distributed datasets without a central server. However, due to the heterogeneity of the local data across the different agents, learning a robust global model is rather challenging. Moreover, the collaboration of the agents relies on their gradient information exchange, which poses a risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose PDSL, a novel privacy-preserved decentralized stochastic learning algorithm with heterogeneous data distribution. On one hand, we innovate in utilizing the notion of Shapley values such that each agent can precisely measure the contributions of its heterogeneous neighbors to the global learning goal; on the other hand, we leverage the notion of differential privacy to prevent each agent from suffering privacy leakage when it contributes gradient information to its neighbors. We conduct both solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our PDSL algorithm in terms of privacy preservation and convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui LU, Shuang Wu, Zhenkai Qin, Dongze Wu, Guifang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the accuracy and robustness of PM$_{2.5}$ concentration forecasting, this paper introduces FALNet, a Frequency-Aware LSTM Network that integrates frequency-domain decomposition, temporal modeling, and attention-based refinement. The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p>

In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a novel hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Amir, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding - a novel method to embed multisets and measures over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space.
  Our proposed embedding approximately preserves the sliced Wasserstein distance on distributions, thereby yielding geometrically meaningful representations that better capture the structure of the input. Moreover, it is injective on measures and bi-Lipschitz on multisets - a significant advantage over prevalent methods based on sum- or max-pooling, which are provably not bi-Lipschitz, and, in many cases, not even injective. The required output dimension for these guarantees is near-optimal: roughly $2 N d$, where $N$ is the maximal input multiset size.
  Furthermore, we prove that it is impossible to embed distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space in a bi-Lipschitz manner. Thus, the metric properties of our embedding are, in a sense, the best possible.
  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields superior multiset representations that improve performance in practical learning tasks. Specifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with an MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced) Wasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding makes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only minor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Gu, Ruoyu Chen, Hua Zhang, Yue Hu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Grokking, referring to the abrupt improvement in test accuracy after extended overfitting, offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of model generalization. Existing researches based on progress measures imply that grokking relies on understanding the optimization dynamics when the loss function is dominated solely by the weight decay term. However, we find that this optimization merely leads to token uniformity, which is not a sufficient condition for grokking. In this work, we investigate the grokking mechanism underlying the Transformer in the task of prime number operations. Based on theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we present the following insights: (i) The weight decay term encourages uniformity across all tokens in the embedding space when it is minimized. (ii) The occurrence of grokking is jointly determined by the uniformity of the embedding space and the distribution of the training dataset. Building on these insights, we provide a unified perspective for understanding various previously proposed progress measures and introduce a novel, concise, and effective progress measure that could trace the changes in test loss more accurately. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of our theoretical framework, we design a dedicated dataset to validate our theory on ResNet-18, successfully showcasing the occurrence of grokking.

<p>Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.
  Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

<p>Abstract: Graph-level clustering remains a pivotal yet formidable challenge in graph learning. Recently, the integration of deep learning with representation learning has demonstrated notable advancements, yielding performance enhancements to a certain degree. However, existing methods suffer from at least one of the following issues: 1. the original graph structure has noise, and 2. during feature propagation and pooling processes, noise is gradually aggregated into the graph-level embeddings through information propagation. Consequently, these two limitations mask clustering-friendly information, leading to suboptimal graph-level clustering performance. To this end, we propose a novel Dual Boost-Driven Graph-Level Clustering Network (DBGCN) to alternately promote graph-level clustering and filtering out interference information in a unified framework. Specifically, in the pooling step, we evaluate the contribution of features at the global and optimize them using a learnable transformation matrix to obtain high-quality graph-level representation, such that the model's reasoning capability can be improved. Moreover, to enable reliable graph-level clustering, we first identify and suppress information detrimental to clustering by evaluating similarities between graph-level representations, providing more accurate guidance for multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DBGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art graph-level clustering methods on six benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Kochnev, Arash Torabi Goodarzi, Zofia Antonina Bentyn, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> E. M. H. E. B. Ekanayake, N. Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Oscillator Ising machines (OIMs) represent an exemplar case of using physics-inspired non-linear dynamical systems to solve computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The computational performance of such systems is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical properties, the topology of the input graph, and their relative compatibility. In this work, we explore the concept of designing different dynamical systems that minimize the same objective function but exhibit drastically different dynamical properties. Our goal is to leverage this diversification in dynamics to reduce the sensitivity of the computational performance to the underlying graph, and subsequently, enhance the overall effectiveness of such physics-based computational methods. To this end, we introduce a novel dynamical system, the Dynamical Ising Machine (DIM), which, like the OIM, minimizes the Ising Hamiltonian but offers significantly different dynamical properties. We analyze the characteristic properties of the DIM and compare them with those of the OIM. We also show that the relative performance of each model is dependent on the input graph. Our work illustrates that using multiple dynamical systems with varying properties to solve the same COP enables an effective method that is less sensitive to the input graph, while producing robust solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Tamamori</p>
<p>Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanna Cui, Peizheng Wang, Faliang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erin Carson, Xinye Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

<p><b>Authors:</b> M Quamer Nasim, Tannistha Maiti, Ayush Srivastava, Tarry Singh, Jie Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn accurately from large quantities of labeled input data, but often fail to do so when labelled data are scarce. DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy >84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy>50%. Taken together, the EAN-DDA has the potential to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Leo Yan Li-Han, Hua Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: The clinical diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) typically involves manually measuring key radiological angles -- Center-Edge (CE), Tonnis, and Sharp angles -- from pelvic radiographs, a process that is time-consuming and susceptible to variability. This study aims to develop an automated system that integrates these measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency of DDH diagnosis.
  Methods and procedures: We developed an end-to-end deep learning model for keypoint detection that accurately identifies eight anatomical keypoints from pelvic radiographs, enabling the automated calculation of CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles. To support the diagnostic decision, we introduced a novel data-driven scoring system that combines the information from all three angles into a comprehensive and explainable diagnostic output.
  Results: The system demonstrated superior consistency in angle measurements compared to a cohort of eight moderately experienced orthopedists. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles were 0.957 (95% CI: 0.952--0.962), 0.942 (95% CI: 0.937--0.947), and 0.966 (95% CI: 0.964--0.968), respectively. The system achieved a diagnostic F1 score of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.851--0.876), significantly outperforming the orthopedist group (0.777, 95% CI: 0.737--0.817, p = 0.005), as well as using clinical diagnostic criteria for each angle individually (p<0.001).
  Conclusion: The proposed system provides reliable and consistent automated measurements of radiological angles and an explainable diagnostic output for DDH, outperforming moderately experienced clinicians.
  Clinical impact: This AI-powered solution reduces the variability and potential errors of manual measurements, offering clinicians a more consistent and interpretable tool for DDH diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle L. Ferreira, Connor Lau, Zaynaf Salaymang, Rima Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation and measurement of cardiac chambers is critical in cardiac ultrasound but is laborious and poorly reproducible. Neural networks can assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manual annotations. We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels) segmentation combining computer vision, clinical domain knowledge, and deep learning. We trained on 450 echocardiograms (93,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate biometrics. We also tested against external images from an additional 10,030 patients with available manual tracings of the left ventricle. r2 between clinically measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported inter-clinician variation and comparable to supervised learning across several different measurements (r2 0.56-0.84). Average accuracy for detecting abnormal chamber size and function was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.97) compared to clinical measurements. A subset of test echocardiograms (n=553) had corresponding cardiac MRIs, where MRI is the gold standard. Correlation between pipeline and MRI measurements was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and MRI. Finally, the pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an average Dice score of 0.89 (95% CI [0.89]) in the external, manually labeled dataset. Our results demonstrate a manual-label free, clinically valid, and highly scalable method for segmentation from ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Biggs, Christos-Savvas Bouganis, George A. Constantinides</p>
<p>Abstract: The continued need for improvements in accuracy, throughput, and efficiency of Deep Neural Networks has resulted in a multitude of methods that make the most of custom architectures on FPGAs. These include the creation of hand-crafted networks and the use of quantization and pruning to reduce extraneous network parameters. However, with the potential of static solutions already well exploited, we propose to shift the focus to using the varying difficulty of individual data samples to further improve efficiency and reduce average compute for classification. Input-dependent computation allows for the network to make runtime decisions to finish a task early if the result meets a confidence threshold. Early-Exit network architectures have become an increasingly popular way to implement such behaviour in software.
  We create: A Toolflow for Hardware Early-Exit Network Automation (ATHEENA), an automated FPGA toolflow that leverages the probability of samples exiting early from such networks to scale the resources allocated to different sections of the network. The toolflow uses the data-flow model of fpgaConvNet, extended to support Early-Exit networks as well as Design Space Exploration to optimize the generated streaming architecture hardware with the goal of increasing throughput/reducing area while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on three different networks demonstrate a throughput increase of $2.00\times$ to $2.78\times$ compared to an optimized baseline network implementation with no early exits. Additionally, the toolflow can achieve a throughput matching the same baseline with as low as $46\%$ of the resources the baseline requires.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shevtsov, Despoina Antonakaki, Ioannis Lamprou, Polyvios Pratikakis, Sotiris Ioannidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Twitter, as one of the most popular social networks, provides a platform for communication and online discourse. Unfortunately, it has also become a target for bots and fake accounts, resulting in the spread of false information and manipulation. This paper introduces a semi-automatic machine learning pipeline (SAMLP) designed to address the challenges associated with machine learning model development. Through this pipeline, we develop a comprehensive bot detection model named BotArtist, based on user profile features. SAMLP leverages nine distinct publicly available datasets to train the BotArtist model. To assess BotArtist's performance against current state-of-the-art solutions, we evaluate 35 existing Twitter bot detection methods, each utilizing a diverse range of features. Our comparative evaluation of BotArtist and these existing methods, conducted across nine public datasets under standardized conditions, reveals that the proposed model outperforms existing solutions by almost 10% in terms of F1-score, achieving an average score of 83.19% and 68.5% over specific and general approaches, respectively. As a result of this research, we provide one of the largest labeled Twitter bot datasets. The dataset contains extracted features combined with BotArtist predictions for 10,929,533 Twitter user profiles, collected via Twitter API during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War over a 16-month period. This dataset was created based on [Shevtsov et al., 2022a] where the original authors share anonymized tweets discussing the Russo-Ukrainian war, totaling 127,275,386 tweets. The combination of the existing textual dataset and the provided labeled bot and human profiles will enable future development of more advanced bot detection large language models in the post-Twitter API era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. M. Fazle Rabby Labib, Joyanta Jyoti Mondal, Meem Arafat Manab, Xi Xiao, Sarfaraz Newaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks undermines their reliability across numerous applications, underscoring the necessity for an in-depth exploration of these vulnerabilities and the formulation of robust defense strategies. The DeepFool algorithm by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016) represents a pivotal step in identifying minimal perturbations required to induce misclassification of input images. Nonetheless, its generic methodology falls short in scenarios necessitating targeted interventions. Additionally, previous research studies have predominantly concentrated on the success rate of attacks without adequately addressing the consequential distortion of images, the maintenance of image quality, or the confidence threshold required for misclassification. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the Enhanced Targeted DeepFool (ET DeepFool) algorithm, an evolution of DeepFool that not only facilitates the specification of desired misclassification targets but also incorporates a configurable minimum confidence score. Our empirical investigations demonstrate the superiority of this refined approach in maintaining the integrity of images and minimizing perturbations across a variety of DNN architectures. Unlike previous iterations, such as the Targeted DeepFool by Gajjar et al. (2022), our method grants unparalleled control over the perturbation process, enabling precise manipulation of model responses. Preliminary outcomes reveal that certain models, including AlexNet and the advanced Vision Transformer, display commendable robustness to such manipulations. This discovery of varying levels of model robustness, as unveiled through our confidence level adjustments, could have far-reaching implications for the field of image recognition.

<p>Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are in a position to move beyond data-centric, device-oriented connectivity and offer intelligent, immersive experiences based on multi-agent collaboration, especially in the context of the thriving development of pre-trained foundation models (PFM) and the evolving vision of 6G native artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Sha (Renmin University of China), Ruixuan Liu (Renmin University of China), Yixuan Liu (Renmin University of China), Hong Chen (Renmin University of China)</p>
<p>Abstract: The paradigm of Differentially Private SGD~(DP-SGD) can provide a theoretical guarantee for training data in both centralized and federated settings. However, the utility degradation caused by DP-SGD limits its wide application in high-stakes tasks, such as medical image diagnosis. In addition to the necessary perturbation, the convergence issue is attributed to the information loss on the gradient clipping. In this work, we propose a general framework PCDP-SGD, which aims to compress redundant gradient norms and preserve more crucial top gradient components via projection operation before gradient clipping. Additionally, we extend PCDP-SGD as a fundamental component in differential privacy federated learning~(DPFL) for mitigating the data heterogeneous challenge and achieving efficient communication. We prove that pre-projection enhances the convergence of DP-SGD by reducing the dependence of clipping error and bias to a fraction of the top gradient eigenspace, and in theory, limits cross-client variance to improve the convergence under heterogeneous federation. Experimental results demonstrate that PCDP-SGD achieves higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art DP-SGD variants in computer vision tasks. Moreover, PCDP-SGD outperforms current federated learning frameworks when DP is guaranteed on local training sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Ahmed Jamal</p>
<p>Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are fast emerging sensors in the field of Earth Observation. It is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser beams to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of objects and environments. The potential of Full Waveform LiDAR is much greater than just height estimation and 3D reconstruction only. Overall shape of signal provides important information about properties of water body. However, the shape of FWL is unexplored as most LiDAR software work on point cloud by utilizing the maximum value within the waveform. Existing techniques in the field of LiDAR data analysis include depth estimation through inverse modeling and regression of logarithmic intensity and depth for approximating the attenuation coefficient. However, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy. Depth estimation through inverse modeling provides only approximate values and does not account for variations in surface properties, while the regression approach for the attenuation coefficient is only able to generalize a value through several data points which lacks precision and may lead to significant errors in estimation. Additionally, there is currently no established modeling method available for predicting bottom reflectance. This research proposed a novel solution based on neural networks for parameter estimation in LIDAR data analysis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed solution successfully learned the inversion model, was able to do prediction of parameters such as depth, attenuation coefficient, and bottom reflectance. Performance of model was validated by testing it on real LiDAR data. In future, more data availability would enable more accuracy and reliability of such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lu, Tinghan Ye, Wenbo Chen, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baihan Lin, Djallel Bouneffouf, Yulia Landa, Rachel Jespersen, Cheryl Corcoran, Guillermo Cecchi</p>
<p>Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical predictor of psychotherapy success. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze session transcripts and map them to distributed representations. These representations capture the semantic similarities between the dialogues and psychometric instruments, such as the Working Alliance Inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions spanning diverse psychiatric conditions -- including anxiety (N=498), depression (N=377), schizophrenia (N=71), and suicidal tendencies (N=12) -- collected between 1970 and 2012, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories, offering interpretable insights for clinical practice, and identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and how these topics evolve during each turn of the conversation. This integrated framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enables timely feedback for therapists on the quality of therapeutic relationships, and provides clear, actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</p>

For instance, automated tool segmentation can assist surgeons in visualizing and tracking of endovascular tools during cardiac procedures. While learning-based models have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation performances, generating ground-truth labels for fully-supervised methods is both labor-intensive time consuming, and costly. In this study, we propose a weakly-supervised learning method with multi-lateral pseudo labeling for tool segmentation in cardiovascular angiogram datasets. The method utilizes a modified U-Net architecture featuring one encoder and multiple laterally branched decoders. The decoders generate diverse pseudo labels under different perturbations, augmenting available partial labels. The pseudo labels are self-generated using a mixed loss function with shared consistency across the decoders. The weakly-supervised model was trained end-to-end and validated using partially annotated angiogram data from three cardiovascular catheterization procedures. Validation results show that the model could perform closer to fully-supervised models. Also, the proposed weakly-supervised multi-lateral method outperforms three well known methods used for weakly-supervised learning, offering the highest segmentation performance across the three angiogram datasets. Furthermore, numerous ablation studies confirmed the model's consistent performance under different parameters. Finally, the model was applied for tool segmentation in a robot-assisted catheterization experiments. The model enhanced visualization with high connectivity indices for guidewire and catheter, and a mean processing time of 35 ms per frame.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingzhi Li, Junyu Liu, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuichiro Terasaki, Kohei Nakajima</p>
<p>Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable, and each network has its own characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior of the scale of weight at the infinite limit, the finite-size effects, and the symmetry in learning period three.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14139">Contribute to balance, wire in accordance: Emergence of backpropagation from a simple, bio-plausible neuroplasticity rule</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Fan, Shreesh P Mysore</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) has been pivotal in advancing machine learning and remains essential in computational applications and comparative studies of biological and artificial neural networks. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning image representations that capture rich semantic relationships remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are either contrastive, lacking robust theoretical guarantees, or struggle to effectively represent the partial orders inherent to structured visual-semantic data. In this paper, we introduce a nuclear norm-based loss function, grounded in the same information theoretic principles that have proved effective in self-supervised learning. We present a theoretical characterization of this loss, demonstrating that, in addition to promoting class orthogonality, it encodes the spectral geometry of the data within a subspace lattice. This geometric representation allows us to associate logical propositions with subspaces, ensuring that our learned representations adhere to a predefined symbolic structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Ghorbel, Halima Bouzidi, Ioan Marius Bilasco, Ihsen Alouani</p>
<p>Abstract: Model hijacking can cause significant accountability and security risks since the owner of a hijacked model can be framed for having their model offer illegal or unethical services. Prior works consider model hijacking as a training time attack, whereby an adversary requires full access to the ML model training. In this paper, we consider a stronger threat model for an inference-time hijacking attack, where the adversary has no access to the training phase of the victim model. Our intuition is that ML models, which are typically over-parameterized, might have the capacity to (unintentionally) learn more than the intended task they are trained for. We propose SnatchML, a new training-free model hijacking attack, that leverages the extra capacity learnt by the victim model to infer different tasks that can be semantically related or unrelated to the original one. Our results on models deployed on AWS Sagemaker showed that SnatchML can deliver high accuracy on hijacking tasks. Interestingly, while all previous approaches are limited by the number of classes in the benign task, SnatchML can hijack models for tasks that contain more classes than the original. We explore different methods to mitigate this risk; We propose meta-unlearning, which is designed to help the model unlearn a potentially malicious task while training for the original task. We also provide insights on over-parametrization as a possible inherent factor that facilitates model hijacking, and accordingly, we propose a compression-based countermeasure to counteract this attack. We believe this work offers a previously overlooked perspective on model hijacking attacks, presenting a stronger threat model and higher applicability in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present $\varepsilon$-retrain, an exploration strategy encouraging a behavioral preference while optimizing policies with monotonic improvement guarantees. To this end, we introduce an iterative procedure for collecting retrain areas -- parts of the state space where an agent did not satisfy the behavioral preference. Our method switches between the typical uniform restart state distribution and the retrain areas using a decaying factor $\varepsilon$, allowing agents to retrain on situations where they violated the preference. We also employ formal verification of neural networks to provably quantify the degree to which agents adhere to these behavioral preferences. Experiments over hundreds of seeds across locomotion, power network, and navigation tasks show that our method yields agents that exhibit significant performance and sample efficiency improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowei Wang, Changyu Dong, Xiangfu Song, Jin Li, Zhili Zhou, Di Wang, Han Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In data-driven applications, preserving user privacy while enabling valuable computations remains a critical challenge. Technologies like differential privacy have been pivotal in addressing these concerns. The shuffle model of DP requires no trusted curators and can achieve high utility by leveraging the privacy amplification effect yielded from shuffling. These benefits have led to significant interest in the shuffle model. However, the computation tasks in the shuffle model are limited to statistical estimation, making it inapplicable to real-world scenarios in which each user requires a personalized output. This paper introduces a novel paradigm termed Private Individual Computation (PIC), expanding the shuffle model to support a broader range of permutation-equivariant computations. PIC enables personalized outputs while preserving privacy, and enjoys privacy amplification through shuffling. We propose a concrete protocol that realizes PIC. By using one-time public keys, our protocol enables users to receive their outputs without compromising anonymity, which is essential for privacy amplification. Additionally, we present an optimal randomizer, the Minkowski Response, designed for the PIC model to enhance utility. We formally prove the security and privacy properties of the PIC protocol. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate PIC's capability in handling non-statistical computation tasks, and the efficacy of PIC and the Minkowski randomizer in achieving superior utility compared to existing solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Ines Rieger, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score $\eta$, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Glyn-Davies, Arnaud Vadeboncoeur, O. Deniz Akyildiz, Ieva Kazlauskaite, Mark Girolami</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a computationally efficient and scalable methodology for approximate Bayesian inference. It strikes a balance between accuracy of uncertainty quantification and practical tractability. It excels at generative modelling and inversion tasks due to its built-in Bayesian regularisation and flexibility, essential qualities for physics related problems. For such problems, the underlying physical model determines the dependence between variables of interest, which in turn will require a tailored derivation for the central VI learning objective. Furthermore, in many physical inference applications this structure has rich meaning and is essential for accurately capturing the dynamics of interest. In this paper, we provide an accessible and thorough technical introduction to VI for forward and inverse problems, guiding the reader through standard derivations of the VI framework and how it can best be realized through deep learning. We then review and unify recent literature exemplifying the flexibility allowed by VI. This paper is designed for a general scientific audience looking to solve physics-based problems with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shraddha Rajpal, Zeeshan Ahmed, Tyrus Berry</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes an approach that integrates reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC) to solve finite-horizon optimal control problems in mixed-logical dynamical systems efficiently. Optimization-based control of such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails the online solution of mixed-integer linear programs, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims to mitigate this issue by decoupling the decision on the discrete variables from the decision on the continuous variables. In the proposed approach, reinforcement learning determines the discrete decision variables and simplifies the online optimization problem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear program to a linear program, significantly reducing the computational time. A fundamental contribution of this work is the definition of the decoupled Q-function, which plays a crucial role in making the learning problem tractable in a combinatorial action space. We motivate the use of recurrent neural networks to approximate the decoupled Q-function and show how they can be employed in a reinforcement learning setting. Simulation experiments on a microgrid system using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method substantially reduces the online computation time of MPC while maintaining high feasibility and low suboptimality.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the medical field, the limited availability of large-scale datasets and labor-intensive annotation processes hinder the performance of deep models. Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian L. Hines, Oliver J. Hines</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal and nonparametric estimands in economics and biostatistics can often be viewed as the mean of a linear functional applied to an unknown outcome regression function. Naively learning the regression function and taking a sample mean of the target functional results in biased estimators, and a rich debiasing literature has developed where one additionally learns the so-called Riesz representer (RR) of the target estimand (targeted learning, double ML, automatic debiasing etc.). Learning the RR via its derived functional form can be challenging, e.g. due to extreme inverse probability weights or the need to learn conditional density functions. Such challenges have motivated recent advances in automatic debiasing (AD), where the RR is learned directly via minimization of a bespoke loss. We propose moment-constrained learning as a new RR learning approach that addresses some shortcomings in AD, constraining the predicted moments and improving the robustness of RR estimates to optimization hyperparamters. Though our approach is not tied to a particular class of learner, we illustrate it using neural networks, and evaluate on the problems of average treatment/derivative effect estimation using semi-synthetic data. Our numerical experiments show improved performance versus state of the art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milena Gazdieva, Jaemoo Choi, Alexander Kolesov, Jaewoong Choi, Petr Mokrov, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Aggregating data from multiple sources can be formalized as an Optimal Transport (OT) barycenter problem, which seeks to compute the average of probability distributions with respect to OT discrepancies. However, in real-world scenarios, the presence of outliers and noise in the data measures can significantly hinder the performance of traditional statistical methods for estimating OT barycenters. To address this issue, we propose a novel scalable approach for estimating the robust continuous barycenter, leveraging the dual formulation of the (semi-)unbalanced OT problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to develop an algorithm for robust barycenters under the continuous distribution setup. Our method is framed as a min-max optimization problem and is adaptable to general cost functions. We rigorously establish the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness to outliers and class imbalance through a number of illustrative experiments.

<p>Abstract: This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we automatically generate 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long in Ego4D based on human-annotated data. This is one of the largest egocentric QA datasets. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a \textit{global glimpse} step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buu Phan, Brandon Amos, Itai Gat, Marton Havasi, Matthew Muckley, Karen Ullrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is associated with many poorly understood shortcomings in language models (LMs), yet remains an important component for long sequence scaling purposes. This work studies how tokenization impacts model performance by analyzing and comparing the stochastic behavior of tokenized models with their byte-level, or token-free, counterparts. We discover that, even when the two models are statistically equivalent, their predictive distributions over the next byte can be substantially different, a phenomenon we term as ``tokenization bias''. To fully characterize this phenomenon, we introduce the Byte-Token Representation Lemma, a framework that establishes a mapping between the learned token distribution and its equivalent byte-level distribution. From this result, we develop a next-byte sampling algorithm that eliminates tokenization bias without requiring further training or optimization. In other words, this enables zero-shot conversion of tokenized LMs into statistically equivalent token-free ones. We demonstrate its broad applicability with two use cases: fill-in-the-middle (FIM) tasks and model ensembles. In FIM tasks where input prompts may terminate mid-token, leading to out-of-distribution tokenization, our method mitigates performance degradation and achieves 18% improvement in FIM coding benchmarks, while consistently outperforming the standard token healing fix. For model ensembles where each model employs a distinct vocabulary, our approach enables seamless integration, resulting in improved performance up to 3.7% over individual models across various standard baselines in reasoning, knowledge, and coding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Jiang, Christina Robinson, Joseph Anderson, William Hisey, Lynn Butterly, Arief Suriawinata, Saeed Hassanpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Colonoscopy screening effectively identifies and removes polyps before they progress to colorectal cancer (CRC), but current follow-up guidelines rely primarily on histopathological features, overlooking other important CRC risk factors. Variability in polyp characterization among pathologists also hinders consistent surveillance decisions. Advances in digital pathology and deep learning enable the integration of pathology slides and medical records for more accurate CRC risk prediction. Using data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry, including longitudinal follow-up, we adapted a transformer-based model for histopathology image analysis to predict 5-year CRC risk. We further explored multi-modal fusion strategies to combine clinical records with deep learning-derived image features. Training the model to predict intermediate clinical variables improved 5-year CRC risk prediction (AUC = 0.630) compared to direct prediction (AUC = 0.615, p = 0.013). Incorporating both imaging and non-imaging data, without requiring manual slide review, further improved performance (AUC = 0.674) compared to traditional features from colonoscopy and microscopy reports (AUC = 0.655, p = 0.001). These results highlight the value of integrating diverse data modalities with computational methods to enhance CRC risk stratification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Yu, Yuhong Wang, Wei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Bus holding control is a widely-adopted strategy for maintaining stability and improving the operational efficiency of bus systems. Traditional model-based methods often face challenges with the low accuracy of bus state prediction and passenger demand estimation. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a data-driven approach, has demonstrated great potential in formulating bus holding strategies. RL determines the optimal control strategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the overall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in real-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging, normally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this study introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based modules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward refiner. These modules cooperate to initialize and iteratively improve the reward function according to the feedback from training and test results for the specified RL-based task. Ineffective reward functions generated by the LLM are filtered out to ensure the stable evolution of the RL agents' performance over iterations. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed LLM-enhanced RL paradigm, it is applied to extensive bus holding control scenarios that vary in the number of bus lines, stops, and passenger demand. The results demonstrate the superiority, generalization capability, and robustness of the proposed paradigm compared to vanilla RL strategies, the LLM-based controller, physics-based feedback controllers, and optimization-based controllers. This study sheds light on the great potential of utilizing LLMs in various smart mobility applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Stolfo, Vidhisha Balachandran, Safoora Yousefi, Eric Horvitz, Besmira Nushi</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to follow instructions is crucial for numerous real-world applications of language models. In pursuit of deeper insights and more powerful capabilities, we derive instruction-specific vector representations from language models and use them to steer models accordingly. These vectors are computed as the difference in activations between inputs with and without instructions, enabling a modular approach to activation steering. We demonstrate how this method can enhance model adherence to constraints such as output format, length, and word inclusion, providing inference-time control over instruction following. Our experiments across four models demonstrate how we can use the activation vectors to guide models to follow constraints even without explicit instructions and to enhance performance when instructions are present. Additionally, we explore the compositionality of activation steering, successfully applying multiple instructions simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that steering vectors computed on instruction-tuned models can transfer to improve base models. Our findings demonstrate that activation steering offers a practical and scalable approach for fine-grained control in language generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Noble, Louis Grenioux, Marylou Gabri\'e, Alain Oliviero Durmus</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Basile, Valentino Maiorca, Luca Bortolussi, Emanuele Rodol\`a, Francesco Locatello</p>
<p>Abstract: When examined through the lens of their residual streams, a puzzling property emerges in transformer networks: residual contributions (e.g., attention heads) sometimes specialize in specific tasks or input attributes. In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral geometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in vision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional structure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal components and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety of input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization in multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and specialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This specialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training data, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for boosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we translate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a technique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for gold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e., attributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual perspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performance on different data distributions while modelling an extremely interpretable and parameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on 70 pre-trained network-dataset combinations (7 models, 10 datasets).</p>

<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature, leading to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Butoi, Ghazal Khalighinejad, Anej Svete, Josef Valvoda, Ryan Cotterell, Brian DuSell</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI. However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support. The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common instead to evaluate language models on proxy tasks, e.g., language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction, that are similar in only an informal sense to the underlying theory. We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al. (2025) for efficient length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages. We provide results on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neural architectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. We find that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliary training objectives such as language modeling can help, although no single objective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures. Our contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing of language recognition claims in future work. We have released our datasets as a benchmark called FLaRe (Formal Language Recognition), along with our code.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10614">To Shuffle or not to Shuffle: Auditing DP-SGD with Shuffling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai, Borja Balle, Jamie Hayes, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: The Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm allows the training of machine learning (ML) models with formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Since DP-SGD processes training data in batches, it employs Poisson sub-sampling to select each batch at every step. However, it has become common practice to replace sub-sampling with shuffling owing to better compatibility and computational overhead. At the same time, we do not know how to compute tight theoretical guarantees for shuffling; thus, DP guarantees of models privately trained with shuffling are often reported as though Poisson sub-sampling was used.
  This prompts the need to verify whether gaps exist between the theoretical DP guarantees reported by state-of-the-art models and their actual leakage. To do so, we introduce a novel DP auditing procedure to analyze DP-SGD with shuffling and show that DP models trained with this approach have considerably overestimated privacy guarantees (up to 4 times). In the process, we assess the impact on privacy leakage of several parameters, including batch size, privacy budget, and threat model. Finally, we study two common variations of the shuffling procedure that result in even further privacy leakage (up to 10 times). Overall, our work attests to the risk of using shuffling instead of Poisson sub-sampling vis-\`a-vis privacy leakage from DP-SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of learning latent-variable models. A common algorithmic technique for this task is the method of moments. Unfortunately, moment-based approaches are hampered by the fact that the moment tensors of super-constant degree cannot even be written down in polynomial time. Motivated by such learning applications, we develop a general efficient algorithm for {\em implicit moment tensor computation}. Our framework generalizes the work of~\cite{LL21-opt} which developed an efficient algorithm for the specific moment tensors that arise in clustering mixtures of spherical Gaussians.
  By leveraging our implicit moment estimation algorithm, we obtain the first $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$-time learning algorithms for the following models.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Linear Regressions} We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm for this task, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians} For density estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time learning algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is the desired total variation error, under the condition that the means lie in a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log k})$. For parameter estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm under the {\em optimal} mean separation of $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(k/\epsilon))$.
  * {\bf Positive Linear Combinations of Non-Linear Activations} We give a general algorithm for this task with complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) g(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error and the function $g$ depends on the Hermite concentration of the target class of functions. Specifically, for positive linear combinations of ReLU activations, our algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daomin Ji, Hui Luo, Zhifeng Bao, Shane Culpepper</p>
<p>Abstract: Table integration aims to create a comprehensive table by consolidating tuples containing relevant information. In this work, we investigate the challenge of integrating multiple tables from a data lake, focusing on three core tasks: 1) pairwise integrability judgment, which determines whether a tuple pair is integrable, accounting for any occurrences of semantic equivalence or typographical errors; 2) integrable set discovery, which identifies all integrable sets in a table based on pairwise integrability judgments established in the first task; 3) multi-tuple conflict resolution, which resolves conflicts between multiple tuples during integration. To this end, we train a binary classifier to address the task of pairwise integrability judgment. Given the scarcity of labeled data in data lakes, we propose a self-supervised adversarial contrastive learning algorithm to perform classification, which incorporates data augmentation methods and adversarial examples to autonomously generate new training data. Upon the output of pairwise integrability judgment, each integrable set can be considered as a community, a densely connected sub-graph where nodes and edges correspond to tuples in the table and their pairwise integrability respectively, we proceed to investigate various community detection algorithms to address the integrable set discovery objective. Moving forward to tackle multi-tuple conflict resolution, we introduce an innovative in-context learning methodology. This approach capitalizes on the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) to effectively resolve conflicts that arise when integrating multiple tuples. Notably, our method minimizes the need for annotated data, making it particularly suited for scenarios where labeled datasets are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kee Siong Ng, Samuel Yang-Zhao, Timothy Cadogan-Cowper</p>
<p>Abstract: The AI safety literature is full of examples of powerful AI agents that, in blindly pursuing a specific and usually narrow objective, ends up with unacceptable and even catastrophic collateral damage to others. In this paper, we consider the problem of social harms that can result from actions taken by learning and utility-maximising agents in a multi-agent environment. The problem of measuring social harms or impacts in such multi-agent settings, especially when the agents are artificial generally intelligent (AGI) agents, was listed as an open problem in Everitt et al, 2018. We attempt a partial answer to that open problem in the form of market-based mechanisms to quantify and control the cost of such social harms. The proposed setup captures many well-studied special cases and is more general than existing formulations of multi-agent reinforcement learning with mechanism design in two ways: (i) the underlying environment is a history-based general reinforcement learning environment like in AIXI; (ii) the reinforcement-learning agents participating in the environment can have different learning strategies and planning horizons. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed setup, we survey some key classes of learning algorithms and present a few applications, including a discussion of the Paperclips problem and pollution control with a cap-and-trade system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<p>Abstract: Selective classification is a powerful tool for automated decision-making in high-risk scenarios, allowing classifiers to make only highly confident decisions while abstaining when uncertainty is too high. Given a target classification accuracy, our goal is to minimize the number of indecisions, which are observations that we do not automate. For problems that are hard, the target accuracy may not be achievable without using indecisions. In contrast, by using indecisions, we are able to control the misclassification rate to any user-specified level, even below the Bayes optimal error rate, while minimizing the frequency of identifying an indecision. We provide a full characterization of the minimax risk in selective classification, proving key continuity and monotonicity properties that enable optimal indecision selection. Our results extend to hypothesis testing, where we control type II error given a fixed type I error, introducing a novel perspective in selective inference. We analyze the impact of estimating the regression function $\eta$, showing that plug-in classifiers remain consistent and that accuracy-based calibration effectively controls indecision levels. Additionally, we develop finite-sample calibration methods and identify cases where no training data is needed under the Monotone Likelihood Ratio (MLR) property. In the binary Gaussian mixture model, we establish sharp phase transition results, demonstrating that minimal indecisions can yield near-optimal accuracy even with suboptimal class separation. These findings highlight the potential of selective classification to significantly reduce misclassification rates with a relatively small cost in terms of indecisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Pryce, Karla Diaz-Ordaz, Ruth H. Keogh, Stijn Vansteelandt</p>
<p>Abstract: When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, missing outcome data can complicate treatment effect estimation, causing certain subgroups of the population to be poorly represented. In this work, we discuss this commonly overlooked problem and consider the impact that missing at random (MAR) outcome data has on causal machine learning estimators for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). We propose two de-biased machine learning estimators for the CATE, the mDR-learner and mEP-learner, which address the issue of under-representation by integrating inverse probability of censoring weights into the DR-learner and EP-learner respectively. We show that under reasonable conditions, these estimators are oracle efficient, and illustrate their favorable performance through simulated data settings, comparing them to existing CATE estimators, including comparison to estimators which use common missing data techniques. We present an example of their application using the GBSG2 trial, exploring treatment effect heterogeneity when comparing hormonal therapies to non-hormonal therapies among breast cancer patients post surgery, and offer guidance on the decisions a practitioner must make when implementing these estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiange Luo, Ang Cao, Gunhee Lee, Justin Johnson, Honglak Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they may over-rely on visual language priors existing in their training data rather than true visual reasoning. To investigate this, we introduce ViLP, a benchmark featuring deliberately out-of-distribution images synthesized via image generation models and out-of-distribution Q&A pairs. Each question in ViLP is coupled with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one that can be resolved by text priors alone and two that demand visual reasoning. Although, humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA data, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on the actual visual inputs, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Li, Yuxuan Zhang, Feilong Tang, Ming Hu, Zhixiang Lu, Haochen Xue, Jianghao Wu, Mian Zhou, Kang Dang, Chong Li, Yifang Wang, Imran Razzak, Jionglong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language is the primary communication mode for 72 million hearing-impaired individuals worldwide, necessitating effective bidirectional Sign Language Production and Sign Language Translation systems. However, functional bidirectional systems require a unified linguistic environment, hindered by the lack of suitable unified datasets, particularly those providing the necessary pose information for accurate Sign Language Production (SLP) evaluation. Concurrently, current SLP evaluation methods like back-translation ignore pose accuracy, and high-quality coordinated generation remains challenging. To create this crucial environment and overcome these challenges, we introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, which together constitute the first unified dataset aimed at supporting bidirectional accessibility systems for Chinese sign language; CNText2Sign provides 15,000 natural language-to-sign mappings and standardized skeletal keypoints for 8,643 vocabulary items supporting pose assessment. Building upon this foundation, we propose the AuraLLM model, which leverages a decoupled architecture with CNText2Sign's pose data for novel direct gesture accuracy assessment. The model employs retrieval augmentation and Cascading Vocabulary Resolution to handle semantic mapping and out-of-vocabulary words and achieves all-scenario production with controllable coordination of gestures and facial expressions via pose-conditioned video synthesis. Concurrently, our Sign Language Translation model SignMST-C employs targeted self-supervised pretraining for dynamic feature capture, achieving new SOTA results on PHOENIX2014-T with BLEU-4 scores up to 32.08. AuraLLM establishes a strong performance baseline on CNText2Sign with a BLEU-4 score of 50.41 under direct evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tara Radvand, Mojtaba Abdolmaleki, Mohamed Mostagir, Ambuj Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors decrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator model $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our experiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support our theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting with adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of the origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for combating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhang Chai, Elynn Chen, Jianqing Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamic decision-making scenarios across business and healthcare, leveraging sample trajectories from diverse populations can significantly enhance reinforcement learning (RL) performance for specific target populations, especially when sample sizes are limited. While existing transfer learning methods primarily focus on linear regression settings, they lack direct applicability to reinforcement learning algorithms. This paper pioneers the study of transfer learning for dynamic decision scenarios modeled by non-stationary finite-horizon Markov decision processes, utilizing neural networks as powerful function approximators and backward inductive learning. We demonstrate that naive sample pooling strategies, effective in regression settings, fail in Markov decision processes.To address this challenge, we introduce a novel ``re-weighted targeting procedure'' to construct ``transferable RL samples'' and propose ``transfer deep $Q^*$-learning'', enabling neural network approximation with theoretical guarantees. We assume that the reward functions are transferable and deal with both situations in which the transition densities are transferable or nontransferable. Our analytical techniques for transfer learning in neural network approximation and transition density transfers have broader implications, extending to supervised transfer learning with neural networks and domain shift scenarios. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate the advantages of our method, showcasing its potential for improving decision-making through strategically constructing transferable RL samples in non-stationary reinforcement learning contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Dong, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donglin Zhan, Leonardo F. Toso, James Anderson</p>
<p>Abstract: We study task selection to enhance sample efficiency in model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning (MAML-RL). Traditional meta-RL typically assumes that all available tasks are equally important, which can lead to task redundancy when they share significant similarities. To address this, we propose a coreset-based task selection approach that selects a weighted subset of tasks based on how diverse they are in gradient space, prioritizing the most informative and diverse tasks. Such task selection reduces the number of samples needed to find an $\epsilon$-close stationary solution by a factor of O(1/$\epsilon$). Consequently, it guarantees a faster adaptation to unseen tasks while focusing training on the most relevant tasks. As a case study, we incorporate task selection to MAML-LQR (Toso et al., 2024b), and prove a sample complexity reduction proportional to O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) when the task specific cost also satisfy gradient dominance. Our theoretical guarantees underscore task selection as a key component for scalable and sample-efficient meta-RL. We numerically validate this trend across multiple RL benchmark problems, illustrating the benefits of task selection beyond the LQR baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullahi Isa Ahmed, Jamal Bentahar, El Mehdi Amhoud</p>
<p>Abstract: As next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks continue to grow, the number of connected devices is rapidly increasing, along with their energy demands. This creates challenges for resource management and sustainability. Energy-efficient communication, particularly for power-limited IoT devices, is therefore a key research focus. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power, spreading factor, bandwidth, and user association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly improves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Bracale, Moulinath Banerjee, Yuekai Sun, Kevin Stoll, Salam Turki</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a shape-constrained approach to dynamic pricing for censored data in the linear valuation model eliminating the need for tuning parameters commonly required by existing methods. Previous works have addressed the challenge of unknown market noise distribution $F_0$ using strategies ranging from kernel methods to reinforcement learning algorithms, such as bandit techniques and upper confidence bounds (UCB), under the assumption that $F_0$ satisfies Lipschitz (or stronger) conditions. In contrast, our method relies on isotonic regression under the weaker assumption that $F_0$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$, for which we derive a regret upper bound. Simulations and experiments with real-world data obtained by Welltower Inc (a major healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust) consistently demonstrate that our method attains lower empirical regret in comparison to several existing methods in the literature while offering the advantage of being tuning-parameter free.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06564">Nearly Optimal Robust Covariance and Scatter Matrix Estimation Beyond Gaussians</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Novikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of computationally efficient robust estimation of the covariance/scatter matrix of elliptical distributions -- that is, affine transformations of spherically symmetric distributions -- under the strong contamination model in the high-dimensional regime $d \gtrsim 1/\varepsilon^2$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of adversarial corruptions.
  We propose an algorithm that, under a very mild assumption on the scatter matrix $\Sigma$, and given a nearly optimal number of samples $n = \tilde{O}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$, computes in polynomial time an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that, with high probability, \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\|_{\text F} \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  As an application of our result, we obtain the first efficiently computable, nearly optimal robust covariance estimators that extend beyond the Gaussian case. Specifically, for elliptical distributions satisfying the Hanson--Wright inequality (such as Gaussians and uniform distributions over ellipsoids), our estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance $\Sigma$ achieves the same error guarantee as in the Gaussian case. Moreover, for elliptical distributions with sub-exponential tails (such as the multivariate Laplace distribution), we construct an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ satisfying the spectral norm bound \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\| \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  Our approach is based on estimating the covariance of the spatial sign of elliptical distributions. The estimation proceeds in several stages, one of which involves a novel spectral covariance filtering algorithm. This algorithm combines covariance filtering techniques with degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations, and we believe it may be of independent interest for future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ads recommendation is a prominent service of online advertising systems and has been actively studied. Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional survival metrics, such as Harrell's concordance index and the Brier Score, rely on the independent censoring assumption for valid inference in the presence of right-censored data. However, when instances are censored for reasons related to the event of interest, this assumption no longer holds, as this kind of dependent censoring biases the marginal survival estimates of popular nonparametric estimators. In this paper, we propose three copula-based metrics to evaluate survival models in the presence of dependent censoring, and design a framework to create realistic, semi-synthetic datasets with dependent censoring to facilitate the evaluation of the metrics. Our empirical analyses in synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that our metrics can give error estimates that are closer to the true error, mainly in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourajit Das, Kirtan Gopal Panda, Navid NaderiAlizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of packet-based information routing in large-scale wireless communication networks. The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of collaborative robots into industrial environments has improved productivity, but has also highlighted significant challenges related to operator safety and ergonomics. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception, continuous ergonomic monitoring, and adaptive Behaviour Tree decision-making to overcome the limitations of traditional methods that typically operate as isolated components. Our approach synthesizes deep learning models, advanced tracking algorithms, and dynamic ergonomic assessments into a modular, scalable, and adaptive system. Experimental validation demonstrates the framework's superiority over existing solutions across multiple dimensions: the visual perception module outperformed previous detection models with 72.4% mAP@50:95; the system achieved high accuracy in recognizing operator intentions (92.5%); it promptly classified ergonomic risks with minimal latency (0.57 seconds); and it dynamically managed robotic interventions with exceptionally responsive decision-making capabilities (0.07 seconds), representing a 56% improvement over benchmark systems. This comprehensive solution provides a robust platform for enhancing human-robot collaboration in industrial environments by prioritizing ergonomic safety, operational efficiency, and real-time adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDE, while aligning with the degraded objective function. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franco Caspe, Jordie Shier, Mark Sandler, Charalampos Saitis, Andrew McPherson</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over high-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in real-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for intimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep learning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS literature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter typically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the task of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for audio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an iterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model we call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is low-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing timbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a specialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and present a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from musical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this document to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency inference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for musicians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \ul{S}emantic \ul{T}argeting for \ul{A}nalytical \ul{R}epair (\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. \textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\textsc{MINT}) and optimization methods (\textsc{SGD}), \textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. \textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on three code generation tasks using popular code LMs, \textsc{STAR} demonstrates superior effectiveness. Additionally, \textsc{STAR} exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, \textsc{STAR} outperforms prior work by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeng Wang, Minghao Shao, Mohammed Nabeel, Prithwish Basu Roy, Likhitha Mankali, Jitendra Bhandari, Ramesh Karri, Ozgur Sinanoglu, Muhammad Shafique, Johann Knechtel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alisa Liu, Jonathan Hayase, Valentin Hofmann, Sewoong Oh, Noah A. Smith, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeng Wang, Minghao Shao, Jitendra Bhandari, Likhitha Mankali, Ramesh Karri, Ozgur Sinanoglu, Muhammad Shafique, Johann Knechtel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \`Alex Pujol Vidal, Sergio Escalera, Kamal Nasrollahi, Thomas B. Moeslund</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning methods have become increasingly important for selective concept removal in large pre-trained models. While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlin Gili, Kyle Heuton, Astha Shah, Michael C. Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: In the education system, problem-solving correctness is often inappropriately conflated with student learning. Advances in both Physics Education Research (PER) and Machine Learning (ML) provide the initial tools to develop a more meaningful and efficient measurement scheme for whether physics students are engaging in sensemaking: a learning process of figuring out the how and why for a particular phenomena. In this work, we contribute such a measurement scheme, which quantifies the evidence of students' physical sensemaking given their written explanations for their solutions to physics problems. We outline how the proposed human annotation scheme can be automated into a deployable ML model using language encoders and shared probabilistic classifiers. The procedure is scalable for a large number of problems and students. We implement three unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a deployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023 Introduction to Physics course at Tufts University. Furthermore, we compute sensemaking scores for all students, and analyze these measurements alongside their corresponding problem-solving accuracies. We find no linear relationship between these two variables, supporting the hypothesis that one is not a reliable proxy for the other. We discuss how sensemaking scores can be used alongside problem-solving accuracies to provide a more nuanced snapshot of student performance in physics class.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kechen Li, Jiaming Liu, Zhenyu Wu, Tianbo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: The predictive analysis of match outcomes and player momentum in professional tennis has long been a subject of scholarly debate. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to game prediction by combining a multi-level fuzzy evaluation model with a CV-GRNN model. We first identify critical statistical indicators via Principal Component Analysis and then develop a two-tier fuzzy model based on the Wimbledon data. In addition, the results of Pearson Correlation Coefficient indicate that the momentum indicators, such as Player Win Streak and Score Difference, have a strong correlation among them, revealing insightful trends among players transitioning between losing and winning streaks. Subsequently, we refine the CV-GRNN model by incorporating 15 statistically significant indicators, resulting in an increase in accuracy to 86.64% and a decrease in MSE by 49.21%. This consequently strengthens the methodological framework for predicting tennis match outcomes, emphasizing its practical utility and potential for adaptation in various athletic contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Jakob, Andrea Iannelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Adib Oumer, Amr Alanwar, Majid Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a critical challenge, especially when system models are difficult to obtain or cannot be fully trusted due to uncertainty, modeling errors, or environmental disturbances. Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaskaran Singh Walia, Shravan Venkatraman, Pavithra LK</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anja Surina, Amin Mansouri, Lars Quaedvlieg, Amal Seddas, Maryna Viazovska, Emmanuel Abbe, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rijul Magu, Arka Dutta, Sean Kim, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh, Munmun De Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Han, Xunyuan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Shipboard carbon capture is a promising solution to help reduce carbon emissions in international shipping. In this work, we propose a data-driven dynamic modeling and economic predictive control approach within the Koopman framework. This integrated modeling and control approach is used to achieve safe and energy-efficient process operation of shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plants. Specifically, we propose a deep neural Koopman operator modeling approach, based on which a Koopman model with time-varying model parameters is established. This Koopman model predicts the overall economic operational cost and key system outputs, based on accessible partial state measurements. By leveraging this learned model, a constrained economic predictive control scheme is developed. Despite time-varying parameters involved in the formulated model, the formulated optimization problem associated with the economic predictive control design is convex, and it can be solved efficiently during online control implementations. Extensive tests are conducted on a high-fidelity simulation environment for shipboard post-combustion carbon capture processes. Four ship operational conditions are taken into account. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the overall economic operational performance and carbon capture rate. Additionally, the proposed method guarantees safe operation by ensuring that hard constraints on the system outputs are satisfied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgi Ganev, Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai, Sofiane Mahiou, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially Private (DP) generative marginal models are often used in the wild to release synthetic tabular datasets in lieu of sensitive data while providing formal privacy guarantees. These models approximate low-dimensional marginals or query workloads; crucially, they require the training data to be pre-discretized, i.e., continuous values need to first be partitioned into bins. However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred directly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges typically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP guarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.
  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four discretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More precisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and k-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both the choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by almost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and number of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the majority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with non-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks, applying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk. Finally, we propose an optimized approach for automatically selecting the optimal number of bins, achieving high utility while reducing both privacy budget consumption and computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Borne--Pons (Adobe Research, ESA), Mikolaj Czerkawski (Asterisk Labs, ESA), Rosalie Martin (Adobe Research), Romain Rouffet (Adobe Research)</p>
<p>Abstract: Terrain modeling has traditionally relied on procedural techniques, which often require extensive domain expertise and handcrafted rules. In this paper, we present MESA - a novel data-centric alternative by training a diffusion model on global remote sensing data. This approach leverages large-scale geospatial information to generate high-quality terrain samples from text descriptions, showcasing a flexible and scalable solution for terrain generation. The model's capabilities are demonstrated through extensive experiments, highlighting its ability to generate realistic and diverse terrain landscapes. The dataset produced to support this work, the Major TOM Core-DEM extension dataset, is released openly as a comprehensive resource for global terrain data. The results suggest that data-driven models, trained on remote sensing data, can provide a powerful tool for realistic terrain modeling and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Lin, Heshan Liu, Qunshu Lin, Zachary Bright, Shitao Tang, Yihui He, Minghao Liu, Ling Zhu, Cindy Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Objaverse++, a curated subset of Objaverse enhanced with detailed attribute annotations by human experts. Recent advances in 3D content generation have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which contains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although Objaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is limited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation, we manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including aesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object composition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural network capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset. Through experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that models pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance than those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation tasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by our tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the training loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich annotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more efficient path to develop 3D generative models. We release our enhanced dataset of approximately 500,000 curated 3D models to facilitate further research on various downstream tasks in 3D computer vision. In the near future, we aim to extend our annotations to cover the entire Objaverse dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktor Ivanov, Richard C. Wilson, Maurizio Scaramuzza</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Zhang (Lucy),  Dongyan (Lucy),  Huo, Yudong Chen, Qiaomin Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08201">Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizi Zhang, Yanchen Wang, Mehdi Azabou, Alexandre Andre, Zixuan Wang, Hanrui Lyu, The International Brain Laboratory, Eva Dyer, Liam Paninski, Cole Hurwitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08254">Understanding the Impact of Data Domain Extraction on Synthetic Data Privacy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgi Ganev, Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai, Sofiane Mahiou, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs), are widely used to assess the privacy of generative models for tabular synthetic data, including those with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. These attacks often exploit outliers, which are especially vulnerable due to their position at the boundaries of the data domain (e.g., at the minimum and maximum values). However, the role of data domain extraction in generative models and its impact on privacy attacks have been overlooked. In this paper, we examine three strategies for defining the data domain: assuming it is externally provided (ideally from public data), extracting it directly from the input data, and extracting it with DP mechanisms. While common in popular implementations and libraries, we show that the second approach breaks end-to-end DP guarantees and leaves models vulnerable. While using a provided domain (if representative) is preferable, extracting it with DP can also defend against popular MIAs, even at high privacy budgets.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08696">SeaView: Software Engineering Agent Visual Interface for Enhanced Workflow</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Bula, Saurabh Pujar, Luca Buratti, Mihaela Bornea, Avirup Sil</p>
<p>Abstract: Auto-regressive LLM-based software engineering (SWE) agents, henceforth SWE agents, have made tremendous progress (>60% on SWE-Bench Verified) on real-world coding challenges including GitHub issue resolution. SWE agents use a combination of reasoning, environment interaction and self-reflection to resolve issues thereby generating "trajectories". Analysis of SWE agent trajectories is difficult, not only as they exceed LLM sequence length (sometimes, greater than 128k) but also because it involves a relatively prolonged interaction between an LLM and the environment managed by the agent. In case of an agent error, it can be hard to decipher, locate and understand its scope. Similarly, it can be hard to track improvements or regression over multiple runs or experiments. While a lot of research has gone into making these SWE agents reach state-of-the-art, much less focus has been put into creating tools to help analyze and visualize agent output. We propose a novel tool called SeaView: Software Engineering Agent Visual Interface for Enhanced Workflow, with a vision to assist SWE-agent researchers to visualize and inspect their experiments. SeaView's novel mechanisms help compare experimental runs with varying hyper-parameters or LLMs, and quickly get an understanding of LLM or environment related problems. Based on our user study, experienced researchers spend between 10 and 30 minutes to gather the information provided by SeaView, while researchers with little experience can spend between 30 minutes to 1 hour to diagnose their experiment.</p>
