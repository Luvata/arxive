<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongpeng Pan, Yang Yang, Zhongtian Fu, Yuxuan Zhang, Shian Du, Yi Xu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This report proposes an improved method for the Tracking Any Point (TAP) task, which tracks any physical surface through a video. Several existing approaches have explored the TAP by considering the temporal relationships to obtain smooth point motion trajectories, however, they still suffer from the cumulative error caused by temporal prediction. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called TAP with confident static points (TAPIR+), which focuses on rectifying the tracking of the static point in the videos shot by a static camera. To clarify, our approach contains two key components: (1) Multi-granularity Camera Motion Detection, which could identify the video sequence by the static camera shot. (2) CMR-based point trajectory prediction with one moving object segmentation approach to isolate the static point from the moving object. Our approach ranked first in the final test with a score of 0.46.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning can automatically generate captions for the given images, and the key challenge is to learn a mapping function from visual features to natural language features. Existing approaches are mostly supervised ones, i.e., each image has a corresponding sentence in the training set. However, considering that describing images always requires a huge of manpower, we usually have limited amount of described images (i.e., image-text pairs) and a large number of undescribed images in real-world applications. Thereby, a dilemma is the "Semi-Supervised Image Captioning". To solve this problem, we propose a novel Semi-Supervised Image Captioning method considering Wasserstein Graph Matching (SSIC-WGM), which turns to adopt the raw image inputs to supervise the generated sentences. Different from traditional single modal semi-supervised methods, the difficulty of semi-supervised cross-modal learning lies in constructing intermediately comparable information among heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, SSIC-WGM adopts the successful scene graphs as intermediate information, and constrains the generated sentences from two aspects: 1) inter-modal consistency. SSIC-WGM constructs the scene graphs of the raw image and generated sentence respectively, then employs the wasserstein distance to better measure the similarity between region embeddings of different graphs. 2) intra-modal consistency. SSIC-WGM takes the data augmentation techniques for the raw images, then constrains the consistency among augmented images and generated sentences. Consequently, SSIC-WGM combines the cross-modal pseudo supervision and structure invariant measure for efficiently using the undescribed images, and learns more reasonable mapping function.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17998">Text Is MASS: Modeling as Stochastic Embedding for Text-Video Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamian Wang, Guohao Sun, Pichao Wang, Dongfang Liu, Sohail Dianat, Majid Rabbani, Raghuveer Rao, Zhiqiang Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of video clips has sparked growing interest in text-video retrieval. Recent advances focus on establishing a joint embedding space for text and video, relying on consistent embedding representations to compute similarity. However, the text content in existing datasets is generally short and concise, making it hard to fully describe the redundant semantics of a video. Correspondingly, a single text embedding may be less expressive to capture the video embedding and empower the retrieval. In this study, we propose a new stochastic text modeling method T-MASS, i.e., text is modeled as a stochastic embedding, to enrich text embedding with a flexible and resilient semantic range, yielding a text mass. To be specific, we introduce a similarity-aware radius module to adapt the scale of the text mass upon the given text-video pairs. Plus, we design and develop a support text regularization to further control the text mass during the training. The inference pipeline is also tailored to fully exploit the text mass for accurate retrieval. Empirical evidence suggests that T-MASS not only effectively attracts relevant text-video pairs while distancing irrelevant ones, but also enables the determination of precise text embeddings for relevant pairs. Our experimental results show a substantial improvement of T-MASS over baseline (3% to 6.3% by R@1). Also, T-MASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets, including MSRVTT, LSMDC, DiDeMo, VATEX, and Charades.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Casao, Fernando Pe\~na, Alberto Sabater, Rosa Castill\'on, Dar\'io Su\'arez, Eduardo Montijano, Ana C. Murillo</p>
<p>Abstract: The increase in non-biodegradable waste is a worldwide concern. Recycling facilities play a crucial role, but their automation is hindered by the complex characteristics of waste recycling lines like clutter or object deformation. In addition, the lack of publicly available labeled data for these environments makes developing robust perception systems challenging. Our work explores the benefits of multimodal perception for object segmentation in real waste management scenarios. First, we present SpectralWaste, the first dataset collected from an operational plastic waste sorting facility that provides synchronized hyperspectral and conventional RGB images. This dataset contains labels for several categories of objects that commonly appear in sorting plants and need to be detected and separated from the main trash flow for several reasons, such as security in the management line or reuse. Additionally, we propose a pipeline employing different object segmentation architectures and evaluate the alternatives on our dataset, conducting an extensive analysis for both multimodal and unimodal alternatives. Our evaluation pays special attention to efficiency and suitability for real-time processing and demonstrates how HSI can bring a boost to RGB-only perception in these realistic industrial settings without much computational overhead.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18036">Move as You Say, Interact as You Can: Language-guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan Wang, Yixin Chen, Baoxiong Jia, Puhao Li, Jinlu Zhang, Jingze Zhang, Tengyu Liu, Yixin Zhu, Wei Liang, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text-to-motion synthesis, generating language-guided human motion within 3D environments poses substantial challenges. These challenges stem primarily from (i) the absence of powerful generative models capable of jointly modeling natural language, 3D scenes, and human motion, and (ii) the generative models' intensive data requirements contrasted with the scarcity of comprehensive, high-quality, language-scene-motion datasets. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel two-stage framework that employs scene affordance as an intermediate representation, effectively linking 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Our framework comprises an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for predicting explicit affordance map and an Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating plausible human motions. By leveraging scene affordance maps, our method overcomes the difficulty in generating human motion under multimodal condition signals, especially when training with limited data lacking extensive language-scene-motion pairs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all baselines on established benchmarks, including HumanML3D and HUMANISE. Additionally, we validate our model's exceptional generalization capabilities on a specially curated evaluation set featuring previously unseen descriptions and scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liping Yang, Joshua Driscol, Ming Gong, Shujie Wang, Catherine G. Potts</p>
<p>Abstract: Line detection is a classic and essential problem in image processing, computer vision and machine intelligence. Line detection has many important applications, including image vectorization (e.g., document recognition and art design), indoor mapping, and important societal challenges (e.g., sea ice fracture line extraction from satellite imagery). Many line detection algorithms and methods have been developed, but robust and intuitive methods are still lacking. In this paper, we proposed and implemented a topological graph-guided algorithm, named TGGLinesPlus, for line detection. Our experiments on images from a wide range of domains have demonstrated the flexibility of our TGGLinesPlus algorithm. We also benchmarked our algorithm with five classic and state-of-the-art line detection methods and the results demonstrate the robustness of TGGLinesPlus. We hope our open-source implementation of TGGLinesPlus will inspire and pave the way for many applications where spatial science matters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanz Cuevas-Velasquez, Alejandro Gal\'an-Cuenca, Antonio Javier Gallego, Marcelo Saval-Calvo, Robert B. Fisher</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional data registration is an established yet challenging problem that is key in many different applications, such as mapping the environment for autonomous vehicles, and modeling objects and people for avatar creation, among many others. Registration refers to the process of mapping multiple data into the same coordinate system by means of matching correspondences and transformation estimation. Novel proposals exploit the benefits of deep learning architectures for this purpose, as they learn the best features for the data, providing better matches and hence results. However, the state of the art is usually focused on cases of relatively small transformations, although in certain applications and in a real and practical environment, large transformations are very common. In this paper, we present ReLaTo (Registration for Large Transformations), an architecture that faces the cases where large transformations happen while maintaining good performance for local transformations. This proposal uses a novel Softmax pooling layer to find correspondences in a bilateral consensus manner between two point sets, sampling the most confident matches. These matches are used to estimate a coarse and global registration using weighted Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A target-guided denoising step is then applied to both the obtained matches and latent features, estimating the final fine registration considering the local geometry. All these steps are carried out following an end-to-end approach, which has been shown to improve 10 state-of-the-art registration methods in two datasets commonly used for this task (ModelNet40 and KITTI), especially in the case of large transformations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18063">Spectral Convolutional Transformer: Harmonizing Real vs. Complex Multi-View Spectral Operators for Vision Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Badri N. Patro, Vinay P. Namboodiri, Vijay S. Agneeswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers used in vision have been investigated through diverse architectures - ViT, PVT, and Swin. These have worked to improve the attention mechanism and make it more efficient. Differently, the need for including local information was felt, leading to incorporating convolutions in transformers such as CPVT and CvT. Global information is captured using a complex Fourier basis to achieve global token mixing through various methods, such as AFNO, GFNet, and Spectformer. We advocate combining three diverse views of data - local, global, and long-range dependence. We also investigate the simplest global representation using only the real domain spectral representation - obtained through the Hartley transform. We use a convolutional operator in the initial layers to capture local information. Through these two contributions, we are able to optimize and obtain a spectral convolution transformer (SCT) that provides improved performance over the state-of-the-art methods while reducing the number of parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that SCT-C-small gives state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset and reaches 84.5\% top-1 accuracy, while SCT-C-Large reaches 85.9\% and SCT-C-Huge reaches 86.4\%. We evaluate SCT on transfer learning on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flower, and Stanford Car. We also evaluate SCT on downstream tasks i.e. instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. The project page is available on this webpage.\url{https://github.com/badripatro/sct}</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have been explored within the marine litter problem for approximately 20 years but the majority of the research has developed rapidly in the last five years. We provide an in-depth, up to date, summary and analysis of 28 of the most recent and significant contributions of deep learning in marine debris. From cross referencing the research paper results, the YOLO family significantly outperforms all other methods of object detection but there are many respected contributions to this field that have categorically agreed that a comprehensive database of underwater debris is not currently available for machine learning. Using a small dataset curated and labelled by us, we tested YOLOv5 on a binary classification task and found the accuracy was low and the rate of false positives was high; highlighting the importance of a comprehensive database. We conclude this survey with over 40 future research recommendations and open challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Sinha, Alexandros Stergiou, Dima Damen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video repetition counting infers the number of repetitions of recurring actions or motion within a video. We propose an exemplar-based approach that discovers visual correspondence of video exemplars across repetitions within target videos. Our proposed Every Shot Counts (ESCounts) model is an attention-based encoder-decoder that encodes videos of varying lengths alongside exemplars from the same and different videos. In training, ESCounts regresses locations of high correspondence to the exemplars within the video. In tandem, our method learns a latent that encodes representations of general repetitive motions, which we use for exemplar-free, zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments over commonly used datasets (RepCount, Countix, and UCFRep) showcase ESCounts obtaining state-of-the-art performance across all three datasets. On RepCount, ESCounts increases the off-by-one from 0.39 to 0.56 and decreases the mean absolute error from 0.38 to 0.21. Detailed ablations further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhongyi Yang, Anastasia Tkach, Shreyas Hampali, Linguang Zhang, Elliot J. Crowley, Cem Keskin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present EgoPoseFormer, a simple yet effective transformer-based model for stereo egocentric human pose estimation. The main challenge in egocentric pose estimation is overcoming joint invisibility, which is caused by self-occlusion or a limited field of view (FOV) of head-mounted cameras. Our approach overcomes this challenge by incorporating a two-stage pose estimation paradigm: in the first stage, our model leverages the global information to estimate each joint's coarse location, then in the second stage, it employs a DETR style transformer to refine the coarse locations by exploiting fine-grained stereo visual features. In addition, we present a deformable stereo operation to enable our transformer to effectively process multi-view features, which enables it to accurately localize each joint in the 3D world. We evaluate our method on the stereo UnrealEgo dataset and show it significantly outperforms previous approaches while being computationally efficient: it improves MPJPE by 27.4mm (45% improvement) with only 7.9% model parameters and 13.1% FLOPs compared to the state-of-the-art. Surprisingly, with proper training techniques, we find that even our first-stage pose proposal network can achieve superior performance compared to previous arts. We also show that our method can be seamlessly extended to monocular settings, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SceneEgo dataset, improving MPJPE by 25.5mm (21% improvement) compared to the best existing method with only 60.7% model parameters and 36.4% FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisoo Jeong, Hong Cai, Risheek Garrepalli, Jamie Menjay Lin, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of ground-truth labels poses one major challenge in developing optical flow estimation models that are both generalizable and robust. While current methods rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit the rich information available in labeled video sequences. We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. Utilizing a forward warping approach, OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the teacher model's predicted optical flow, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The teacher's weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student. Our evaluations demonstrate perceptually superior interpolation quality and enhanced optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as Sintel and KITTI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdy Dousty, David J. Fleet, Jos\'e Zariffa</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand function is critical for our interactions and quality of life. Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can impair hand function, reducing independence. A comprehensive evaluation of function in home and community settings requires a hand grasp taxonomy for individuals with impaired hand function. Developing such a taxonomy is challenging due to unrepresented grasp types in standard taxonomies, uneven data distribution across injury levels, and limited data. This study aims to automatically identify the dominant distinct hand grasps in egocentric video using semantic clustering. Egocentric video recordings collected in the homes of 19 individual with cervical SCI were used to cluster grasping actions with semantic significance. A deep learning model integrating posture and appearance data was employed to create a personalized hand taxonomy. Quantitative analysis reveals a cluster purity of 67.6% +- 24.2% with with 18.0% +- 21.8% redundancy. Qualitative assessment revealed meaningful clusters in video content. This methodology provides a flexible and effective strategy to analyze hand function in the wild. It offers researchers and clinicians an efficient tool for evaluating hand function, aiding sensitive assessments and tailored intervention plans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huei-Chung Hu, Xuyang Wu, Yuan Wang, Yi Fang, Hsin-Tai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous works concerning head pose estimation (HPE) offer algorithms or proposed neural network-based approaches for extracting Euler angles from either facial key points or directly from images of the head region. However, many works failed to provide clear definitions of the coordinate systems and Euler or Tait-Bryan angles orders in use. It is a well-known fact that rotation matrices depend on coordinate systems, and yaw, roll, and pitch angles are sensitive to their application order. Without precise definitions, it becomes challenging to validate the correctness of the output head pose and drawing routines employed in prior works. In this paper, we thoroughly examined the Euler angles defined in the 300W-LP dataset, head pose estimation such as 3DDFA-v2, 6D-RepNet, WHENet, etc, and the validity of their drawing routines of the Euler angles. When necessary, we infer their coordinate system and sequence of yaw, roll, pitch from provided code. This paper presents (1) code and algorithms for inferring coordinate system from provided source code, code for Euler angle application order and extracting precise rotation matrices and the Euler angles, (2) code and algorithms for converting poses from one rotation system to another, (3) novel formulae for 2D augmentations of the rotation matrices, and (4) derivations and code for the correct drawing routines for rotation matrices and poses. This paper also addresses the feasibility of defining rotations with right-handed coordinate system in Wikipedia and SciPy, which makes the Euler angle extraction much easier for full-range head pose research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Liu, Jiaming Zhang, Andres Diaz-Pinto, Haowei Li, Alejandro Martin-Gomez, Amir Kheradmand, Mehran Armand</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has drawn significant attention from researchers who work on medical image segmentation because of its generalizability. However, researchers have found that SAM may have limited performance on medical images compared to state-of-the-art non-foundation models. Regardless, the community sees potential in extending, fine-tuning, modifying, and evaluating SAM for analysis of medical imaging. An increasing number of works have been published focusing on the mentioned four directions, where variants of SAM are proposed. To this end, a unified platform helps push the boundary of the foundation model for medical images, facilitating the use, modification, and validation of SAM and its variants in medical image segmentation. In this work, we introduce SAMM Extended (SAMME), a platform that integrates new SAM variant models, adopts faster communication protocols, accommodates new interactive modes, and allows for fine-tuning of subcomponents of the models. These features can expand the potential of foundation models like SAM, and the results can be translated to applications such as image-guided therapy, mixed reality interaction, robotic navigation, and data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Rege Cambrin, Paolo Garza</p>
<p>Abstract: Earthquake monitoring is necessary to promptly identify the affected areas, the severity of the events, and, finally, to estimate damages and plan the actions needed for the restoration process. The use of seismic stations to monitor the strength and origin of earthquakes is limited when dealing with remote areas (we cannot have global capillary coverage). Identification and analysis of all affected areas is mandatory to support areas not monitored by traditional stations. Using social media images in crisis management has proven effective in various situations. However, they are still limited by the possibility of using communication infrastructures in case of an earthquake and by the presence of people in the area. Moreover, social media images and messages cannot be used to estimate the actual severity of earthquakes and their characteristics effectively. The employment of satellites to monitor changes around the globe grants the possibility of exploiting instrumentation that is not limited by the visible spectrum, the presence of land infrastructures, and people in the affected areas. In this work, we propose a new dataset composed of images taken from Sentinel-1 and a new series of tasks to help monitor earthquakes from a new detailed view. Coupled with the data, we provide a series of traditional machine learning and deep learning models as baselines to assess the effectiveness of ML-based models in earthquake analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javid Akhavan, Youmna Mahmoud, Ke Xu, Jiaqi Lyu, Souran Manoochehri</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, Additive Manufacturing (AM), particularly metal AM, has emerged as a significant contributor due to its innovative and cost-effective approach to fabricate highly intricate geometries. Despite its potential, this industry still lacks real-time capable process monitoring algorithms. Recent advancements in this field suggest that Melt Pool (MP) signatures during the fabrication process contain crucial information about process dynamics and quality. To obtain this information, various sensory approaches, such as high-speed cameras-based vision modules are employed for online fabrication monitoring. However, many conventional in-depth analyses still cannot process all the recorded data simultaneously. Although conventional Image Processing (ImP) solutions provide a targeted tunable approach, they pose a trade-off between convergence certainty and convergence speed. As a result, conventional methods are not suitable for a dynamically changing application like MP monitoring. Therefore, this article proposes the implementation of a Tunable Deep Image Processing (TDIP) method to address the data-rich monitoring needs in real-time. The proposed model is first trained to replicate an ImP algorithm with tunable features and methodology. The TDIP model is then further improved to account for MP geometries and fabrication quality based on the vision input and process parameters. The TDIP model achieved over 94% estimation accuracy with more than 96% R2 score for quality, geometry, and MP signature estimation and isolation. The TDIP model can process 500 images per second, while conventional methods taking a few minutes per image. This significant processing time reduction enables the integration of vision-based monitoring in real-time for processes and quality estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Gu, Zhaoyang Lv, Duncan Frost, Simon Green, Julian Straub, Chris Sweeney</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present EgoLifter, a novel system that can automatically segment scenes captured from egocentric sensors into a complete decomposition of individual 3D objects. The system is specifically designed for egocentric data where scenes contain hundreds of objects captured from natural (non-scanning) motion. EgoLifter adopts 3D Gaussians as the underlying representation of 3D scenes and objects and uses segmentation masks from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as weak supervision to learn flexible and promptable definitions of object instances free of any specific object taxonomy. To handle the challenge of dynamic objects in ego-centric videos, we design a transient prediction module that learns to filter out dynamic objects in the 3D reconstruction. The result is a fully automatic pipeline that is able to reconstruct 3D object instances as collections of 3D Gaussians that collectively compose the entire scene. We created a new benchmark on the Aria Digital Twin dataset that quantitatively demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance in open-world 3D segmentation from natural egocentric input. We run EgoLifter on various egocentric activity datasets which shows the promise of the method for 3D egocentric perception at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rintaro Yanagi, Yamato Okamoto, Shuhei Yokoo, Shin'ichi Satoh</p>
<p>Abstract: The short video-sharing services that allow users to post 10-30 second videos (e.g., YouTube Shorts and TikTok) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, conventional video copy detection (VCD) methods mainly focus on general video-sharing services (e.g., YouTube and Bilibili), and the effects of short video-sharing services on video copy detection are still unclear. Considering that illegally copied videos in short video-sharing services have service-distinctive characteristics, especially in those time lengths, the pros and cons of VCD in those services are required to be analyzed. In this paper, we examine the effects of short video-sharing services on VCD by constructing a dataset that has short video-sharing service characteristics. Our novel dataset is automatically constructed from the publicly available dataset to have reference videos and fixed short-time-length query videos, and such automation procedures assure the reproducibility and data privacy preservation of this paper. From the experimental results focusing on segment-level and video-level situations, we can see that three effects: "Segment-level VCD in short video-sharing services is more difficult than those in general video-sharing services", "Video-level VCD in short video-sharing services is easier than those in general video-sharing services", "The video alignment component mainly suppress the detection performance in short video-sharing services".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krushi Patel, Fengjun Li, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and segmenting polyps is crucial for expediting the diagnosis of colon cancer. This is a challenging task due to the large variations of polyps in color, texture, and lighting conditions, along with subtle differences between the polyp and its surrounding area. Recently, vision Transformers have shown robust abilities in modeling global context for polyp segmentation. However, they face two major limitations: the inability to learn local relations among multi-level layers and inadequate feature aggregation in the decoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel decoder architecture aimed at hierarchically aggregating locally enhanced multi-level dense features. Specifically, we introduce a novel module named Dense Attention Gate (DAG), which adaptively fuses all previous layers' features to establish local feature relations among all layers. Furthermore, we propose a novel nested decoder architecture that hierarchically aggregates decoder features, thereby enhancing semantic features. We incorporate our novel dense decoder with the PVT backbone network and conduct evaluations on five polyp segmentation datasets: Kvasir, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, and ETIS. Our experiments and comparisons with nine competing segmentation models demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the previous models on four datasets.

<p>Abstract: We present a method for large-mask pluralistic image inpainting based on the generative framework of discrete latent codes. Our method learns latent priors, discretized as tokens, by only performing computations at the visible locations of the image. This is realized by a restrictive partial encoder that predicts the token label for each visible block, a bidirectional transformer that infers the missing labels by only looking at these tokens, and a dedicated synthesis network that couples the tokens with the partial image priors to generate coherent and pluralistic complete image even under extreme mask settings. Experiments on public benchmarks validate our design choices as the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in both visual quality and diversity metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Finding a suitable layout represents a crucial task for diverse applications in graphic design. Motivated by simpler and smoother sampling trajectories, we explore the use of Flow Matching as an alternative to current diffusion-based layout generation models. Specifically, we propose LayoutFlow, an efficient flow-based model capable of generating high-quality layouts. Instead of progressively denoising the elements of a noisy layout, our method learns to gradually move, or flow, the elements of an initial sample until it reaches its final prediction. In addition, we employ a conditioning scheme that allows us to handle various generation tasks with varying degrees of conditioning with a single model. Empirically, LayoutFlow performs on par with state-of-the-art models while being significantly faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Wang, Yongqiang Bai, Hongxing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: RGB-T tracking, a vital downstream task of object tracking, has made remarkable progress in recent years. Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data. To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios. We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges. We pioneer the use of the middle fusion framework for RGB-T tracking, which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the pre-trained RGB tracking model into the framework and utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to the comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and the improved modeling of fusion-modal features, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks, while attaining 46.1 fps inference speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenxing Wei, Xing Wei, Zhiheng Ma, Songlin Dong, Shaochen Zhang, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting anomaly patterns from images is a crucial artificial intelligence technique in industrial applications. Recent research in this domain has emphasized the necessity of a large volume of training data, overlooking the practical scenario where, post-deployment of the model, unlabeled data containing both normal and abnormal samples can be utilized to enhance the model's performance. Consequently, this paper focuses on addressing the challenging yet practical few-shot online anomaly detection and segmentation (FOADS) task. Under the FOADS framework, models are trained on a few-shot normal dataset, followed by inspection and improvement of their capabilities by leveraging unlabeled streaming data containing both normal and abnormal samples simultaneously.
  To tackle this issue, we propose modeling the feature distribution of normal images using a Neural Gas network, which offers the flexibility to adapt the topology structure to identify outliers in the data flow. In order to achieve improved performance with limited training samples, we employ multi-scale feature embedding extracted from a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet to obtain a robust representation. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm that can incrementally update parameters without the need to store previous samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve substantial performance under the FOADS setting, while ensuring that the time complexity remains within an acceptable range on MVTec AD and BTAD datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chihiro Noguchi, Toshiaki Ohgushi, Masao Yamanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of unknown traffic obstacles is vital to ensure safe autonomous driving. The standard object-detection methods cannot identify unknown objects that are not included under predefined categories. This is because object-detection methods are trained to assign a background label to pixels corresponding to the presence of unknown objects. To address this problem, the pixel-wise anomaly-detection approach has attracted increased research attention. Anomaly-detection techniques, such as uncertainty estimation and perceptual difference from reconstructed images, make it possible to identify pixels of unknown objects as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, when applied to images with many unknowns and complex components, such as driving scenes, these methods often exhibit unstable performance. The purpose of this study is to achieve stable performance for detecting unknown objects by incorporating the object-detection fashions into the pixel-wise anomaly detection methods. To achieve this goal, we adopt a semantic-segmentation network with a sigmoid head that simultaneously provides pixel-wise anomaly scores and objectness scores. Our experimental results show that the objectness scores play an important role in improving the detection performance. Based on these results, we propose a novel anomaly score by integrating these two scores, which we term as unknown objectness score. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to the publicly available datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhang Xia, Shihao Song, Zhanglu Hou, Junwen Xu, Juan Zou, Yuan Liu, Shengxiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) based on multimodal data has attracted considerable attention owing to its great potential in applications. Various manually designed multimodal deep networks have performed well in multimodal HGR (MHGR), but most of existing algorithms require a lot of expert experience and time-consuming manual trials. To address these issues, we propose an evolutionary network architecture search framework with the adaptive multimodel fusion (AMF-ENAS). Specifically, we design an encoding space that simultaneously considers fusion positions and ratios of the multimodal data, allowing for the automatic construction of multimodal networks with different architectures through decoding. Additionally, we consider three input streams corresponding to intra-modal surface electromyography (sEMG), intra-modal accelerometer (ACC), and inter-modal sEMG-ACC. To automatically adapt to various datasets, the ENAS framework is designed to automatically search a MHGR network with appropriate fusion positions and ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that ENAS has been utilized in MHGR to tackle issues related to the fusion position and ratio of multimodal data. Experimental results demonstrate that AMF-ENAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ninapro DB2, DB3, and DB7 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Huo, Yikai Wang, Xuelin Qian, Yun Wang, Chong Li, Jianfeng Feng, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent fMRI-to-image approaches mainly focused on associating fMRI signals with specific conditions of pre-trained diffusion models. These approaches, while producing high-quality images, capture only a limited aspect of the complex information in fMRI signals and offer little detailed control over image creation. In contrast, this paper proposes to directly modulate the generation process of diffusion models using fMRI signals. Our approach, NeuroPictor, divides the fMRI-to-image process into three steps: i) fMRI calibrated-encoding, to tackle multi-individual pre-training for a shared latent space to minimize individual difference and enable the subsequent cross-subject training; ii) fMRI-to-image cross-subject pre-training, perceptually learning to guide diffusion model with high- and low-level conditions across different individuals; iii) fMRI-to-image single-subject refining, similar with step ii but focus on adapting to particular individual. NeuroPictor extracts high-level semantic features from fMRI signals that characterizing the visual stimulus and incrementally fine-tunes the diffusion model with a low-level manipulation network to provide precise structural instructions. By training with over 60,000 fMRI-image pairs from various individuals, our model enjoys superior fMRI-to-image decoding capacity, particularly in the within-subject setting, as evidenced in benchmark datasets.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18228">Fourier or Wavelet bases as counterpart self-attention in spikformer for efficient visual classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Wang, Duzhen Zhang, Tilelin Zhang, Bo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy-efficient spikformer has been proposed by integrating the biologically plausible spiking neural network (SNN) and artificial Transformer, whereby the Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) is used to achieve both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. However, it seems that self-attention is not always necessary, especially in sparse spike-form calculation manners. In this paper, we innovatively replace vanilla SSA (using dynamic bases calculating from Query and Key) with spike-form Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, and their combinations (using fixed triangular or wavelets bases), based on a key hypothesis that both of them use a set of basis functions for information transformation. Hence, the Fourier-or-Wavelet-based spikformer (FWformer) is proposed and verified in visual classification tasks, including both static image and event-based video datasets. The FWformer can achieve comparable or even higher accuracies ($0.4\%$-$1.5\%$), higher running speed ($9\%$-$51\%$ for training and $19\%$-$70\%$ for inference), reduced theoretical energy consumption ($20\%$-$25\%$), and reduced GPU memory usage ($4\%$-$26\%$), compared to the standard spikformer. Our result indicates the continuous refinement of new Transformers, that are inspired either by biological discovery (spike-form), or information theory (Fourier or Wavelet Transform), is promising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangyu Xu, Wanxuan Lu, Hongfeng Yu, Yongqiang Mao, Hanbo Bi, Chenglong Liu, Xian Sun, Kun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: As drone technology advances, using unmanned aerial vehicles for aerial surveys has become the dominant trend in modern low-altitude remote sensing. The surge in aerial video data necessitates accurate prediction for future scenarios and motion states of the interested target, particularly in applications like traffic management and disaster response. Existing video prediction methods focus solely on predicting future scenes (video frames), suffering from the neglect of explicitly modeling target's motion states, which is crucial for aerial video interpretation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task called Target-Aware Aerial Video Prediction, aiming to simultaneously predict future scenes and motion states of the target. Further, we design a model specifically for this task, named TAFormer, which provides a unified modeling approach for both video and target motion states. Specifically, we introduce Spatiotemporal Attention (STA), which decouples the learning of video dynamics into spatial static attention and temporal dynamic attention, effectively modeling the scene appearance and motion. Additionally, we design an Information Sharing Mechanism (ISM), which elegantly unifies the modeling of video and target motion by facilitating information interaction through two sets of messenger tokens. Moreover, to alleviate the difficulty of distinguishing targets in blurry predictions, we introduce Target-Sensitive Gaussian Loss (TSGL), enhancing the model's sensitivity to both target's position and content. Extensive experiments on UAV123VP and VisDroneVP (derived from single-object tracking datasets) demonstrate the exceptional performance of TAFormer in target-aware video prediction, showcasing its adaptability to the additional requirements of aerial video interpretation for target awareness.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D shape generation aims to produce innovative 3D content adhering to specific conditions and constraints. Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision, evolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning image-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as CLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for real-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel visual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text descriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and multiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and knowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual table generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual representations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone visual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs that are built on CLIP visual embeddings.

<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to Generative Class Incremental Learning (GCIL) by introducing the forgetting mechanism, aimed at dynamically managing class information for better adaptation to streaming data. GCIL is one of the hot topics in the field of computer vision, and this is considered one of the crucial tasks in society, specifically the continual learning of generative models. The ability to forget is a crucial brain function that facilitates continual learning by selectively discarding less relevant information for humans. However, in the field of machine learning models, the concept of intentionally forgetting has not been extensively investigated. In this study we aim to bridge this gap by incorporating the forgetting mechanisms into GCIL, thereby examining their impact on the models' ability to learn in continual learning. Through our experiments, we have found that integrating the forgetting mechanisms significantly enhances the models' performance in acquiring new knowledge, underscoring the positive role that strategic forgetting plays in the process of continual learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quality of images captured outdoors is often affected by the weather. One factor that interferes with sight is rain, which can obstruct the view of observers and computer vision applications that rely on those images. The work aims to recover rain images by removing rain streaks via Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) for image deraining (SRL-Derain). We locate rain streak pixels from the input rain image via dictionary learning and use pixel-wise RL agents to take multiple inpainting actions to remove rain progressively. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt where self-supervised RL is applied to image deraining. Experimental results on several benchmark image-deraining datasets show that the proposed SRL-Derain performs favorably against state-of-the-art few-shot and self-supervised deraining and denoising methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiheng Cheng, Qingyue Wei, Hongru Zhu, Yan Wang, Liangqiong Qu, Wei Shao, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention for its versatile segmentation abilities and intuitive prompt-based interface. However, its application in medical imaging presents challenges, requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage, H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask, guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically, we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced, mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution, enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover, the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors, facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuming Liu, Dong Zhuo, Zhiheng Feng, Siting Zhu, Chensheng Peng, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Information inside visual and LiDAR data is well complementary derived from the fine-grained texture of images and massive geometric information in point clouds. However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Images are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features with local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods. Codes will be released later.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changkun Liu, Huajian Huang, Zhengyang Ma, Tristan Braud</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) hierarchical localisation pipelines (HLoc) rely on image retrieval (IR) techniques to establish 2D-3D correspondences by selecting the $k$ most similar images from a reference image database for a given query image. Although higher values of $k$ enhance localisation robustness, the computational cost for feature matching increases linearly with $k$. In this paper, we observe that queries that are the most similar to images in the database result in a higher proportion of feature matches and, thus, more accurate positioning. Thus, a small number of images is sufficient for queries very similar to images in the reference database. We then propose a novel approach, AIR-HLoc, which divides query images into different localisation difficulty levels based on their similarity to the reference image database. We consider an image with high similarity to the reference image as an easy query and an image with low similarity as a hard query. Easy queries show a limited improvement in accuracy when increasing $k$. Conversely, higher values of $k$ significantly improve accuracy for hard queries. Given the limited improvement in accuracy when increasing $k$ for easy queries and the significant improvement for hard queries, we adapt the value of $k$ to the query's difficulty level. Therefore, AIR-HLoc optimizes processing time by adaptively assigning different values of $k$ based on the similarity between the query and reference images without losing accuracy. Our extensive experiments on the Cambridge Landmarks, 7Scenes, and Aachen Day-Night-v1.1 datasets demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy, reducing 30\%, 26\%, and 11\% in computational overhead while maintaining SOTA accuracy compared to HLoc with fixed image retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Xing, Zhenchao Cui, Jing Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: The spatial attention mechanism has been widely used to improve object detection performance. However, its operation is currently limited to static convolutions lacking content-adaptive features. This paper innovatively approaches from the perspective of dynamic convolution. We propose Razor Dynamic Convolution (RDConv) to address thetwo flaws in dynamic weight convolution, making it hard to implement in spatial mechanism: 1) it is computation-heavy; 2) when generating weights, spatial information is disregarded. Firstly, by using Razor Operation to generate certain features, we vastly reduce the parameters of the entire dynamic convolution operation. Secondly, we added a spatial branch inside RDConv to generate convolutional kernel parameters with richer spatial information. Embedding dynamic convolution will also bring the problem of sensitivity to high-frequency noise. We propose the Static-Guided Dynamic Module (SGDM) to address this limitation. By using SGDM, we utilize a set of asymmetric static convolution kernel parameters to guide the construction of dynamic convolution. We introduce the mechanism of shared weights in static convolution to solve the problem of dynamic convolution being sensitive to high-frequency noise. Extensive experiments illustrate that multiple different object detection backbones equipped with SGDM achieve a highly competitive boost in performance(e.g., +4% mAP with YOLOv5n on VOC and +1.7% mAP with YOLOv8n on COCO) with negligible parameter increase(i.e., +0.33M on YOLOv5n and +0.19M on YOLOv8n).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well in close-world scenarios. However, novel classes emerged continually in real applications, making it necessary to learn incrementally. Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to gradually recognize new classes while maintaining the discriminability of old ones. Existing CIL methods have two limitations: a heavy reliance on preserving old data for forgetting mitigation and the need for vast labeled data for knowledge adaptation. To overcome these issues, we propose a non-exemplar semi-supervised CIL framework with contrastive learning and semi-supervised incremental prototype classifier (Semi-IPC). On the one hand, contrastive learning helps the model learn rich representations, easing the trade-off between learning representations of new classes and forgetting that of old classes. On the other hand, Semi-IPC learns a prototype for each class with unsupervised regularization, enabling the model to incrementally learn from partially labeled new data while maintaining the knowledge of old classes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the strong performance of our method: without storing any old samples and only using less than 1% of labels, Semi-IPC outperforms advanced exemplar-based methods. We hope our work offers new insights for future CIL research. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adilbek Karmanov, Dayan Guan, Shijian Lu, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik, Eric Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has attracted increasing attention for tackling distribution shifts during the test time. Though prior studies have achieved very promising performance, they involve intensive computation which is severely unaligned with test-time adaptation. We design TDA, a training-free dynamic adapter that enables effective and efficient test-time adaptation with vision-language models. TDA works with a lightweight key-value cache that maintains a dynamic queue with few-shot pseudo labels as values and the corresponding test-sample features as keys. Leveraging the key-value cache, TDA allows adapting to test data gradually via progressive pseudo label refinement which is super-efficient without incurring any backpropagation. In addition, we introduce negative pseudo labeling that alleviates the adverse impact of pseudo label noises by assigning pseudo labels to certain negative classes when the model is uncertain about its pseudo label predictions. Extensive experiments over two benchmarks demonstrate TDA's superior effectiveness and efficiency as compared with the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced significantly in visual representation learning and recognition. However, they face notable challenges in performance and computational efficiency when dealing with real-world, multi-scale image inputs. Conventional methods rescale all input images into a fixed size, wherein a larger fixed size favors performance but rescaling small size images to a larger size incurs digitization noise and increased computation cost. In this work, we carry out a comprehensive, layer-wise investigation of CNN models in response to scale variation, based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) analysis. The observations reveal lower layers are more sensitive to input image scale variations than high-level layers. Inspired by this insight, we propose Multi-scale Unified Network (MUSN) consisting of multi-scale subnets, a unified network, and scale-invariant constraint. Our method divides the shallow layers into multi-scale subnets to enable feature extraction from multi-scale inputs, and the low-level features are unified in deep layers for extracting high-level semantic features. A scale-invariant constraint is posed to maintain feature consistency across different scales. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and other scale-diverse datasets, demonstrate that MSUN achieves significant improvements in both model performance and computational efficiency. Particularly, MSUN yields an accuracy increase up to 44.53% and diminishes FLOPs by 7.01-16.13% in multi-scale scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Ye, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna, Carl Busart</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks have demonstrated the vulnerability of Machine Learning (ML) image classifiers in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems. An adversarial attack can deceive the classifier into making incorrect predictions by perturbing the input SAR images, for example, with a few scatterers attached to the on-ground objects. Therefore, it is critical to develop robust SAR ATR systems that can detect potential adversarial attacks by leveraging the inherent uncertainty in ML classifiers, thereby effectively alerting human decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware SAR ATR for detecting adversarial attacks. Specifically, we leverage the capability of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in performing image classification with quantified epistemic uncertainty to measure the confidence for each input SAR image. By evaluating the uncertainty, our method alerts when the input SAR image is likely to be adversarially generated. Simultaneously, we also generate visual explanations that reveal the specific regions in the SAR image where the adversarial scatterers are likely to to be present, thus aiding human decision-making with hints of evidence of adversarial attacks. Experiments on the MSTAR dataset demonstrate that our approach can identify over 80% adversarial SAR images with fewer than 20% false alarms, and our visual explanations can identify up to over 90% of scatterers in an adversarial SAR image.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information from neuroimaging examinations (CT, MRI) is increasingly used to support diagnoses of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. While current clinical practice is mainly based on visual inspection and feature engineering, Deep Learning approaches can be used to automate the analysis and to discover new image-biomarkers. Part-prototype neural networks (PP-NN) are an alternative to standard blackbox models, and have shown promising results in general computer vision. PP-NN's base their reasoning on prototypical image regions that are learned fully unsupervised, and combined with a simple-to-understand decision layer. We present PIPNet3D, a PP-NN for volumetric images. We apply PIPNet3D to the clinical case study of Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI). We assess the quality of prototypes under a systematic evaluation framework, propose new metrics to evaluate brain prototypes and perform an evaluation with domain experts. Our results show that PIPNet3D is an interpretable, compact model for Alzheimer's diagnosis with its reasoning well aligned to medical domain knowledge. Notably, PIPNet3D achieves the same accuracy as its blackbox counterpart; and removing the remaining clinically irrelevant prototypes from its decision process does not decrease predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting-Kang Yen, Igor Morawski, Shusil Dangi, Kai He, Chung-Yi Lin, Jia-Fong Yeh, Hung-Ting Su, Winston Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based object detection has recently garnered attention in the computer vision community due to the exceptional properties of event cameras, such as high dynamic range and no motion blur. However, feature asynchronism and sparsity cause invisible objects due to no relative motion to the camera, posing a significant challenge in the task. Prior works have studied various memory mechanisms to preserve as many features as possible at the current time, guided by temporal clues. While these implicit-learned memories retain some short-term information, they still struggle to preserve long-term features effectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as pseudo-occluded objects and aim to reveal their features. Firstly, we introduce visibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to append additional visibility labels on an existing event camera dataset. Secondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to maintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features have not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated as an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the displacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal feature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss to increase the robustness of the overall pipeline. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method's effectiveness where still objects are retained but real occluded objects are discarded. The results demonstrate that (1) the additional visibility labels can assist in supervised training, and (2) our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a significant improvement of 7.9% absolute mAP.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diverse and high-quality content generated by recent generative models demonstrates the great potential of using synthetic data to train downstream models. However, in vision, especially in objection detection, related areas are not fully explored, the synthetic images are merely used to balance the long tails of existing datasets, and the accuracy of the generated labels is low, the full potential of generative models has not been exploited. In this paper, we propose DODA, a data synthesizer that can generate high-quality object detection data for new domains in agriculture. Specifically, we improve the controllability of layout-to-image through encoding layout as an image, thereby improving the quality of labels, and use a visual encoder to provide visual clues for the diffusion model to decouple visual features from the diffusion model, and empowering the model the ability to generate data in new domains. On the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) Dataset, which is the largest dataset in agriculture and contains diverse domains, using the data synthesized by DODA improves the performance of the object detector by 12.74-17.76 AP$_{50}$ in the domain that was significantly shifted from the training data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18342">Learning Inclusion Matching for Animation Paint Bucket Colorization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuekun Dai, Shangchen Zhou, Qinyue Li, Chongyi Li, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorizing line art is a pivotal task in the production of hand-drawn cel animation. This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines, based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However, issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences, leading to mismatches. In this work, we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline, which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module, enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization. To facilitate the training of our network, we also develope a unique dataset, referred to as PaintBucket-Character. This dataset includes rendered line arts alongside their colorized counterparts, featuring various 3D characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing techniques.</p>

This model is capable of simulating distinct growth stages of these plants, diverse soil conditions, and randomized field arrangements under varying lighting conditions. The integration of real-world textures and environmental factors into the procedural generation process enhances the photorealism and applicability of the synthetic data. Our dataset includes 12,000 images with semantic labels, offering a comprehensive resource for computer vision tasks in precision agriculture, such as semantic segmentation for autonomous weed control. We validate our model's effectiveness by comparing the synthetic data against real agricultural images, demonstrating its potential to significantly augment training data for machine learning models in agriculture. This approach not only provides a cost-effective solution for generating high-quality, diverse data but also addresses specific needs in agricultural vision tasks that are not fully covered by general-purpose models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyu Wu, Lingchen Yang, Zhiyi Kuang, Yao Feng, Xutao Han, Yuefan Shen, Hongbo Fu, Kun Zhou, Youyi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Undoubtedly, high-fidelity 3D hair is crucial for achieving realism, artistic expression, and immersion in computer graphics. While existing 3D hair modeling methods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving high-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture conditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned prior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these challenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity hair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for environments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main stages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The exterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization (PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from multiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior 3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates the inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a data-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D structural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the synthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges the domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we generate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair growth algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness across diverse hairstyles and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ba Hung Ngo, Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran, Tuan-Ngoc Nguyen, Hae-Gon Jeon, Tae Jong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Most domain adaptation (DA) methods are based on either a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or a vision transformers (ViTs). They align the distribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their unique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its superior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage in capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid method to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly Class-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their distinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly find class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between the outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source support. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the previously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy between the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually exchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the knowledge discrepancies of these models. Compared to conventional DA methods, our ECB achieves superior performance, which verifies its effectiveness in this hybrid model.

<p>Abstract: his paper tackles a significant challenge faced by Vision Transformers (ViTs): their constrained scalability across different image resolutions. Typically, ViTs experience a performance decline when processing resolutions different from those seen during training. Our work introduces two key innovations to address this issue. Firstly, we propose a novel module for dynamic resolution adjustment, designed with a single Transformer block, specifically to achieve highly efficient incremental token integration. Secondly, we introduce fuzzy positional encoding in the Vision Transformer to provide consistent positional awareness across multiple resolutions, thereby preventing overfitting to any single training resolution. Our resulting model, ViTAR (Vision Transformer with Any Resolution), demonstrates impressive adaptability, achieving 83.3\% top-1 accuracy at a 1120x1120 resolution and 80.4\% accuracy at a 4032x4032 resolution, all while reducing computational costs. ViTAR also shows strong performance in downstream tasks such as instance and semantic segmentation and can easily combined with self-supervised learning techniques like Masked AutoEncoder. Our work provides a cost-effective solution for enhancing the resolution scalability of ViTs, paving the way for more versatile and efficient high-resolution image processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Sigillo, Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Alessandro Nicolosi, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in the field of image generation, primarily driven by the escalating demand for high-quality outcomes across various image generation subtasks, such as inpainting, denoising, and super resolution. A major effort is devoted to exploring the application of super-resolution techniques to enhance the quality of low-resolution images. In this context, our method explores in depth the problem of ship image super resolution, which is crucial for coastal and port surveillance. We investigate the opportunity given by the growing interest in text-to-image diffusion models, taking advantage of the prior knowledge that such foundation models have already learned. In particular, we present a diffusion-model-based architecture that leverages text conditioning during training while being class-aware, to best preserve the crucial details of the ships during the generation of the super-resoluted image. Since the specificity of this task and the scarcity availability of off-the-shelf data, we also introduce a large labeled ship dataset scraped from online ship images, mostly from ShipSpotting\footnote{\url{www.shipspotting.com}} website. Our method achieves more robust results than other deep learning models previously employed for super resolution, as proven by the multiple experiments performed. Moreover, we investigate how this model can benefit downstream tasks, such as classification and object detection, thus emphasizing practical implementation in a real-world scenario. Experimental results show flexibility, reliability, and impressive performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods for different tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changshun Wu, Weicheng He, Chih-Hong Cheng, Xiaowei Huang, Saddek Bensalem</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection techniques for deep neural networks (DNNs) become crucial thanks to their filtering of abnormal inputs, especially when DNNs are used in safety-critical applications and interact with an open and dynamic environment. Nevertheless, integrating OoD detection into state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection DNNs poses significant challenges, partly due to the complexity introduced by the SOTA OoD construction methods, which require the modification of DNN architecture and the introduction of complex loss functions. This paper proposes a simple, yet surprisingly effective, method that requires neither retraining nor architectural change in object detection DNN, called Box Abstraction-based Monitors (BAM). The novelty of BAM stems from using a finite union of convex box abstractions to capture the learned features of objects for in-distribution (ID) data, and an important observation that features from OoD data are more likely to fall outside of these boxes. The union of convex regions within the feature space allows the formation of non-convex and interpretable decision boundaries, overcoming the limitations of VOS-like detectors without sacrificing real-time performance. Experiments integrating BAM into Faster R-CNN-based object detection DNNs demonstrate a considerably improved performance against SOTA OoD detection techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: In class-incremental learning (CIL) scenarios, the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting caused by the classifier's bias towards the current task has long posed a significant challenge. It is mainly caused by the characteristic of discriminative models. With the growing popularity of the generative multi-modal models, we would explore replacing discriminative models with generative ones for CIL. However, transitioning from discriminative to generative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge lies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification of distinct categories. Additionally, it requires formulating the task of CIL within a generative framework. To this end, we propose a novel generative multi-modal model (GMM) framework for class-incremental learning. Our approach directly generates labels for images using an adapted generative model. After obtaining the detailed text, we use a text encoder to extract text features and employ feature matching to determine the most similar label as the classification prediction. In the conventional CIL settings, we achieve significantly better results in long-sequence task scenarios. Under the Few-shot CIL setting, we have improved by at least 14\% accuracy over all the current state-of-the-art methods with significantly less forgetting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinitish Srinivasan, Varenya Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract Art is an immensely popular, discussed form of art that often has the ability to depict the emotions of an artist. Many researchers have made attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN (mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing. Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonkyun Kim, Changin Choi, Wonseok Lee, Wonjong Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models (VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out of ten benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Wu, Junbiao Pang, Baochang Zhang, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a practical challenge in computer vision. Pseudo-label (PL) methods, e.g., FixMatch and FreeMatch, obtain the State Of The Art (SOTA) performances in SSL. These approaches employ a threshold-to-pseudo-label (T2L) process to generate PLs by truncating the confidence scores of unlabeled data predicted by the self-training method. However, self-trained models typically yield biased and high-variance predictions, especially in the scenarios when a little labeled data are supplied. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight channel-based ensemble method to effectively consolidate multiple inferior PLs into the theoretically guaranteed unbiased and low-variance one. Importantly, our approach can be readily extended to any SSL framework, such as FixMatch or FreeMatch. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on CIFAR10/100 in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Li, Keqiang Sun, Zhixin Lai, Xiaoshi Wu, Feng Qiu, Haoran Xie, Kazunori Miyata, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The conditional text-to-image diffusion models have garnered significant attention in recent years. However, the precision of these models is often compromised mainly for two reasons, ambiguous condition input and inadequate condition guidance over single denoising loss. To address the challenges, we introduce two innovative solutions. Firstly, we propose a Spatial Guidance Injector (SGI) which enhances conditional detail by encoding text inputs with precise annotation information. This method directly tackles the issue of ambiguous control inputs by providing clear, annotated guidance to the model. Secondly, to overcome the issue of limited conditional supervision, we introduce Diffusion Consistency Loss (DCL), which applies supervision on the denoised latent code at any given time step. This encourages consistency between the latent code at each time step and the input signal, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the output. The combination of SGI and DCL results in our Effective Controllable Network (ECNet), which offers a more accurate controllable end-to-end text-to-image generation framework with a more precise conditioning input and stronger controllable supervision. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on generation under various conditions, such as human body skeletons, facial landmarks, and sketches of general objects. The results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the controllability and robustness of the generated images, outperforming existing state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Mitsouras, Eleftherios Tsonis, Paraskevi Tzouveli, Athanasios Voulodimos</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image synthesis, producing realistic and high resolution images that faithfully adhere to the corresponding text-prompts. Despite their great success, they still fall behind in sketch-to-image synthesis tasks, where in addition to text-prompts, the spatial layout of the generated images has to closely follow the outlines of certain reference sketches. Employing an MLP latent edge predictor to guide the spatial layout of the synthesized image by predicting edge maps at each denoising step has been recently proposed. Despite yielding promising results, the pixel-wise operation of the MLP does not take into account the spatial layout as a whole, and demands numerous denoising iterations to produce satisfactory images, leading to time inefficiency. To this end, we introduce U-Sketch, a framework featuring a U-Net type latent edge predictor, which is capable of efficiently capturing both local and global features, as well as spatial correlations between pixels. Moreover, we propose the addition of a sketch simplification network that offers the user the choice of preprocessing and simplifying input sketches for enhanced outputs. The experimental results, corroborated by user feedback, demonstrate that our proposed U-Net latent edge predictor leads to more realistic results, that are better aligned with the spatial outlines of the reference sketches, while drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps and, consequently, the overall execution time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world systems often encounter new data over time, which leads to experiencing target domain shifts. Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods tend to apply computationally heavy and memory-intensive backpropagation-based approaches to handle this. Here, we propose a novel method that uses a backpropagation-free approach for TTA for the specific case of 3D data. Our model uses a two-stream architecture to maintain knowledge about the source domain as well as complementary target-domain-specific information. The backpropagation-free property of our model helps address the well-known forgetting problem and mitigates the error accumulation issue. The proposed method also eliminates the need for the usually noisy process of pseudo-labeling and reliance on costly self-supervised training. Moreover, our method leverages subspace learning, effectively reducing the distribution variance between the two domains. Furthermore, the source-domain-specific and the target-domain-specific streams are aligned using a novel entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available at https://github.com/abie-e/BFTT3D.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18443">$\mathrm{F^2Depth}$: Self-supervised Indoor Monocular Depth Estimation via Optical Flow Consistency and Feature Map Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Guo, Huijie Zhao, Shuwei Shao, Xudong Li, Baochang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods have been increasingly given much attention due to the benefit of not requiring large, labelled datasets. Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth estimation framework called $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$. A self-supervised optical flow estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve $\delta_1$ accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown indoor scenes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452">SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Inhwan Bae, Young-Jae Park, Hae-Gon Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valay Bundele, Mahesh Bhupati, Biplab Banerjee, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on expert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations due to the significant effort required to collect them. On the other hand, existing approaches to training VLN agents that go beyond available expert data involve data augmentations or online exploration which can be tedious and risky. In contrast, it is easy to access large repositories of suboptimal offline trajectories. Inspired by research in offline reinforcement learning (ORL), we introduce a new problem setup of VLN-ORL which studies VLN using suboptimal demonstration data. We introduce a simple and effective reward-conditioned approach that can account for dataset suboptimality for training VLN agents, as well as benchmarks to evaluate progress and promote research in this area. We empirically study various noise models for characterizing dataset suboptimality among other unique challenges in VLN-ORL and instantiate it for the VLN$\circlearrowright$BERT and MTVM architectures in the R2R and RxR environments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed reward-conditioned approach leads to significant performance improvements, even in complex and intricate environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Image style transfer aims to imbue digital imagery with the distinctive attributes of style targets, such as colors, brushstrokes, shapes, whilst concurrently preserving the semantic integrity of the content. Despite the advancements in arbitrary style transfer methods, a prevalent challenge remains the delicate equilibrium between content semantics and style attributes. Recent developments in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heralded unprecedented synthesis capabilities, albeit at the expense of relying on extensive and often imprecise textual descriptions to delineate artistic styles. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces DiffStyler, a novel approach that facilitates efficient and precise arbitrary image style transfer. DiffStyler lies the utilization of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model-based LoRA to encapsulate the essence of style targets. This approach, coupled with strategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer process. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that LoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that further inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This technique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model, utilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising process, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original image's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style targets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in achieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style integration.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18469">Density-guided Translator Boosts Synthetic-to-Real Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Yuan, Wankang Zeng, Yanfei Su, Weiquan Liu, Ming Cheng, Yulan Guo, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D synthetic-to-real unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation is crucial to annotating new domains. Self-training is a competitive approach for this task, but its performance is limited by different sensor sampling patterns (i.e., variations in point density) and incomplete training strategies. In this work, we propose a density-guided translator (DGT), which translates point density between domains, and integrates it into a two-stage self-training pipeline named DGT-ST. First, in contrast to existing works that simultaneously conduct data generation and feature/output alignment within unstable adversarial training, we employ the non-learnable DGT to bridge the domain gap at the input level. Second, to provide a well-initialized model for self-training, we propose a category-level adversarial network in stage one that utilizes the prototype to prevent negative transfer. Finally, by leveraging the designs above, a domain-mixed self-training method with source-aware consistency loss is proposed in stage two to narrow the domain gap further. Experiments on two synthetic-to-real segmentation tasks (SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticKITTI and SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticPOSS) demonstrate that DGT-ST outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 9.4$\%$ and 4.3$\%$ mIoU improvements, respectively.

GS recently advanced the novel-view synthesis field by achieving impressive reconstruction quality at a fraction of the computational cost of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, contrary to the latter, it still lacks the ability to provide information about the confidence associated with their outputs. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a Variational Inference-based approach that seamlessly integrates uncertainty prediction into the common rendering pipeline of GS. Additionally, we introduce the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) as a new term in the loss function, enabling optimization of uncertainty estimation alongside image reconstruction. Experimental results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both image rendering quality and uncertainty estimation accuracy. Overall, our framework equips practitioners with valuable insights into the reliability of synthesized views, facilitating safer decision-making in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new knowledge distillation method tailored for image semantic segmentation, termed Intra- and Inter-Class Knowledge Distillation (I2CKD). The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student (compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class, thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network. Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have benefited from large-scale and high-quality data, demonstrating impressive performance. However, these T2I models still struggle to produce images that are aesthetically pleasing, geometrically accurate, faithful to text, and of good low-level quality. We present VersaT2I, a versatile training framework that can boost the performance with multiple rewards of any T2I model. We decompose the quality of the image into several aspects such as aesthetics, text-image alignment, geometry, low-level quality, etc. Then, for every quality aspect, we select high-quality images in this aspect generated by the model as the training set to finetune the T2I model using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Furthermore, we introduce a gating function to combine multiple quality aspects, which can avoid conflicts between different quality aspects. Our method is easy to extend and does not require any manual annotation, reinforcement learning, or model architecture changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaT2I outperforms the baseline methods across various quality criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romana Boiger, Sergey V. Churakov, Ignacio Ballester Llagaria, Georg Kosakowski, Raphael W\"ust, Nikolaos I. Prasianakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep subsurface exploration is important for mining, oil and gas industries, as well as in the assessment of geological units for the disposal of chemical or nuclear waste, or the viability of geothermal energy systems. Typically, detailed examinations of subsurface formations or units are performed on cuttings or core materials extracted during drilling campaigns, as well as on geophysical borehole data, which provide detailed information about the petrophysical properties of the rocks. Depending on the volume of rock samples and the analytical program, the laboratory analysis and diagnostics can be very time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the lithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming to support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper outlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine learning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a remarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into distinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the evaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional log analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against laboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced multidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed here provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep learning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting petrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation classification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing model performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a challenging task: text-to-motion synthesis, aiming to generate motions that align with textual descriptions and exhibit coordinated movements. Currently, the part-based methods introduce part partition into the motion synthesis process to achieve finer-grained generation. However, these methods encounter challenges such as the lack of coordination between different part motions and difficulties for networks to understand part concepts. Moreover, introducing finer-grained part concepts poses computational complexity challenges. In this paper, we propose Part-Coordinating Text-to-Motion Synthesis (ParCo), endowed with enhanced capabilities for understanding part motions and communication among different part motion generators, ensuring a coordinated and fined-grained motion synthesis. Specifically, we discretize whole-body motion into multiple part motions to establish the prior concept of different parts. Afterward, we employ multiple lightweight generators designed to synthesize different part motions and coordinate them through our part coordination module. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on common benchmarks with economic computations, including HumanML3D and KIT-ML, providing substantial evidence of its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Abbasi, Mohammad Samiei, Mohammad Hossein Rohban, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown promising Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and study whether such models can successfully classify those images into composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional generalization abilities of vision-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Cong, Jie Gui, Jing Zhang, Junming Hou, Hao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noor Ahmed, Anna Kukleva, Bernt Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) introduces a paradigm in which the problem space expands with limited data. FSCIL methods inherently face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting as data arrives incrementally, making models susceptible to overwriting previously acquired knowledge. Moreover, given the scarcity of labeled samples available at any given time, models may be prone to overfitting and find it challenging to strike a balance between extensive pretraining and the limited incremental data. To address these challenges, we propose the OrCo framework built on two core principles: features' orthogonality in the representation space, and contrastive learning. In particular, we improve the generalization of the embedding space by employing a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive losses during the pretraining phase. Additionally, we introduce OrCo loss to address challenges arising from data limitations during incremental sessions. Through feature space perturbations and orthogonality between classes, the OrCo loss maximizes margins and reserves space for the following incremental data. This, in turn, ensures the accommodation of incoming classes in the feature space without compromising previously acquired knowledge. Our experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet, CIFAR100, and CUB datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbing Zhang, Mengping Yang, Qin Zhou, Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent thrilling progress in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented synthesis quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) including image generation, 3D and video composition. Further, personalized techniques enable appealing customized production of a novel concept given only several images as reference. However, an intriguing problem persists: Is it possible to capture multiple, novel concepts from one single reference image? In this paper, we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from concepts. To alleviate this, we propose an attention calibration mechanism to improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically, we first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture attributes of multiple concepts. Then, the classes are separated and strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation, ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally, we suppress the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence among concepts. Together, our proposed method, dubbed DisenDiff, can learn disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel customized images with learned concepts. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state of the art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. More importantly, our proposed techniques are compatible with LoRA and inpainting pipelines, enabling more interactive experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhu, Qing Guo, Felix Juefei-Xu, Yihao Huang, Yang Liu, Geguang Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to identify the common and salient (usually in the foreground) regions across a given group of images. Although achieving significant progress, state-of-the-art CoSODs could be easily affected by some adversarial perturbations, leading to substantial accuracy reduction. The adversarial perturbations can mislead CoSODs but do not change the high-level semantic information (e.g., concept) of the co-salient objects. In this paper, we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations, which are subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically, we propose CosalPure containing two modules, i.e., group-image concept learning and concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module, we adopt a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial examples. For the second module, we map the adversarial image to the latent space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing different adversarial patterns, including exposure and noise. The extensive results demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Amirian, Daniel Barco, Ivo Herzig, Frank-Peter Schilling</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning based approaches have been used to improve image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a medical imaging technique often used in applications such as image-guided radiation therapy, implant dentistry or orthopaedics. In particular, while deep learning methods have been applied to reduce various types of CBCT image artifacts arising from motion, metal objects, or low-dose acquisition, a comprehensive review summarizing the successes and shortcomings of these approaches, with a primary focus on the type of artifacts rather than the architecture of neural networks, is lacking in the literature. In this review, the data generation and simulation pipelines, and artifact reduction techniques are specifically investigated for each type of artifact. We provide an overview of deep learning techniques that have successfully been shown to reduce artifacts in 3D, as well as in time-resolved (4D) CBCT through the use of projection- and/or volume-domain optimizations, or by introducing neural networks directly within the CBCT reconstruction algorithms. Research gaps are identified to suggest avenues for future exploration. One of the key findings of this work is an observed trend towards the use of generative models including GANs and score-based or diffusion models, accompanied with the need for more diverse and open training datasets and simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xu, Haipeng Li, Yinqiao Wang, Shuaicheng Liu, Chi-Wing Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh robustly from a single image is very challenging, due to the lack of diversity in existing real-world datasets. While data synthesis helps relieve the issue, the syn-to-real gap still hinders its usage. In this work, we present HandBooster, a new approach to uplift the data diversity and boost the 3D hand-mesh reconstruction performance by training a conditional generative space on hand-object interactions and purposely sampling the space to synthesize effective data samples. First, we construct versatile content-aware conditions to guide a diffusion model to produce realistic images with diverse hand appearances, poses, views, and backgrounds; favorably, accurate 3D annotations are obtained for free. Then, we design a novel condition creator based on our similarity-aware distribution sampling strategies to deliberately find novel and realistic interaction poses that are distinctive from the training set. Equipped with our method, several baselines can be significantly improved beyond the SOTA on the HO3D and DexYCB benchmarks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18593">Homogeneous Tokenizer Matters: Homogeneous Visual Tokenizer for Remote Sensing Image Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Run Shao, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chao Tao, Yunsheng Zhang, Chengli Peng, Haifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The tokenizer, as one of the fundamental components of large models, has long been overlooked or even misunderstood in visual tasks. One key factor of the great comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language tokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of language. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based methods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic elements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in language. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically independent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual tOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception Module (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity, the OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention mechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds within the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number of learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of token quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19 classification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense tasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK correspond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK outperformed Patch Embed by 6\% and 10\% in the two tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison. Compared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one image, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks, respectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zare, Yulei Niu, Hammad Ayyubi, Shih-fu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedure Planning in instructional videos entails generating a sequence of action steps based on visual observations of the initial and target states. Despite the rapid progress in this task, there remain several critical challenges to be solved: (1) Adaptive procedures: Prior works hold an unrealistic assumption that the number of action steps is known and fixed, leading to non-generalizable models in real-world scenarios where the sequence length varies. (2) Temporal relation: Understanding the step temporal relation knowledge is essential in producing reasonable and executable plans. (3) Annotation cost: Annotating instructional videos with step-level labels (i.e., timestamp) or sequence-level labels (i.e., action category) is demanding and labor-intensive, limiting its generalizability to large-scale datasets.In this work, we propose a new and practical setting, called adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or pre-determined. To address these challenges we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model. Specifically, for adaptive procedures, RAP adaptively determines the conclusion of actions using an auto-regressive model architecture. For temporal relation, RAP establishes an external memory module to explicitly retrieve the most relevant state-action pairs from the training videos and revises the generated procedures. To tackle high annotation cost, RAP utilizes a weakly-supervised learning manner to expand the training dataset to other task-relevant, unannotated videos by generating pseudo labels for action steps. Experiments on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks show the superiority of RAP over traditional fixed-length models, establishing it as a strong baseline solution for adaptive procedure planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our work addresses limitations seen in previous approaches for object-centric editing problems, such as unrealistic results due to shape discrepancies and limited control in object replacement or insertion. To this end, we introduce FlexEdit, a flexible and controllable editing framework for objects where we iteratively adjust latents at each denoising step using our FlexEdit block. Initially, we optimize latents at test time to align with specified object constraints. Then, our framework employs an adaptive mask, automatically extracted during denoising, to protect the background while seamlessly blending new content into the target image. We demonstrate the versatility of FlexEdit in various object editing tasks and curate an evaluation test suite with samples from both real and synthetic images, along with novel evaluation metrics designed for object-centric editing. We conduct extensive experiments on different editing scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of our editing framework over recent advanced text-guided image editing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajinkya Khoche, Aron Asefaw, Alejandro Gonzalez, Bogdan Timus, Sina Sharif Mansouri, Patric Jensfelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system. This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR). When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively. However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data. Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs. Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects. This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed. The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18674">Deep Learning for Robust and Explainable Models in Computer Vision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Amirian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing. These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry. However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged. This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.
  Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature. In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.
  This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability. Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research. Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness. In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.</p>

Based on state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, Annolid now harnesses the Cutie video object segmentation model to achieve resilient, markerless tracking of multiple animals from single annotated frames, even in environments in which they may be partially or entirely concealed by environmental features or by one another. Our integration of Segment Anything and Grounding-DINO strategies additionally enables the automatic masking and segmentation of recognizable animals and objects by text command, removing the need for manual annotation. Annolid's comprehensive approach to object segmentation flexibly accommodates a broad spectrum of behavior analysis applications, enabling the classification of diverse behavioral states such as freezing, digging, pup huddling, and social interactions in addition to the tracking of animals and their body parts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxiao Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Guo-Hua Wang, Jianxin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot model compression aims to compress a large model into a more compact one with only a tiny training set (even without labels). Block-level pruning has recently emerged as a leading technique in achieving high accuracy and low latency in few-shot CNN compression. But, few-shot compression for Vision Transformers (ViT) remains largely unexplored, which presents a new challenge. In particular, the issue of sparse compression exists in traditional CNN few-shot methods, which can only produce very few compressed models of different model sizes. This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot ViT compression named DC-ViT. Instead of dropping the entire block, DC-ViT selectively eliminates the attention module while retaining and reusing portions of the MLP module. DC-ViT enables dense compression, which outputs numerous compressed models that densely populate the range of model complexity. DC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot compression methods by a significant margin of 10 percentage points, along with lower latency in the compression of ViT and its variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camille Billouard, Dawa Derksen, Emmanuelle Sarrazin, Bruno Vallet</p>
<p>Abstract: Current stereo-vision pipelines produce high accuracy 3D reconstruction when using multiple pairs or triplets of satellite images. However, these pipelines are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows, reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate the learning. Our model, Satellite Neural Graphics Primitives (SAT-NGP) decreases the learning time to 15 minutes while maintaining the quality of the 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Qu, Haohui Li, Wei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-Generated Images (AGIs) have inherent multimodal nature. Unlike traditional image quality assessment (IQA) on natural scenarios, AGIs quality assessment (AGIQA) takes the correspondence of image and its textual prompt into consideration. This is coupled in the ground truth score, which confuses the unimodal IQA methods. To solve this problem, we introduce IP-IQA (AGIs Quality Assessment via Image and Prompt), a multimodal framework for AGIQA via corresponding image and prompt incorporation. Specifically, we propose a novel incremental pretraining task named Image2Prompt for better understanding of AGIs and their corresponding textual prompts. An effective and efficient image-prompt fusion module, along with a novel special [QA] token, are also applied. Both are plug-and-play and beneficial for the cooperation of image and its corresponding prompt. Experiments demonstrate that our IP-IQA achieves the state-of-the-art on AGIQA-1k and AGIQA-3k datasets. Code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xintong Wang, Jingheng Pan, Liang Ding, Chris Biemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18730">Towards Image Ambient Lighting Normalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florin-Alexandru Vasluianu, Tim Seizinger, Zongwei Wu, Rakesh Ranjan, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with broad applications. However, existing works often simplify this task within the context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting surface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization (ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image restoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution dataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend, a novel strong baseline that maximizes Image-Frequency joint entropy to selectively restore local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow localization priors. Experiments show that IFBlend achieves SOTA scores on Ambient6K and exhibits competitive performance on conventional shadow removal benchmarks compared to shadow-specific models with mask priors. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aims. To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical atherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A deep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the AI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20% internal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median age 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3 months. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The model was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the same institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC model assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome. Overall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC. AUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation cohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort. Sensitivity was consistently above 92% in both cohorts. In the overall cohort (n=540), among patients with AI-CAC=0, a single ASCVD event occurred, after 4.3 years. Patients with AI-CAC>0 had significantly higher Kaplan Meier estimates for ASCVD events (13.5% vs. 3.4%, log-rank=0.013). Conclusion. The AI-CAC model seems to accurately detect subclinical atherosclerosis on chest x-ray with elevated sensitivity, and to predict ASCVD events with elevated negative predictive value. Adoption of the AI-CAC model to refine CV risk stratification or as an opportunistic screening tool requires prospective evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weidong Xie, Lun Luo, Nanfei Ye, Yi Ren, Shaoyi Du, Minhang Wang, Jintao Xu, Rui Ai, Weihao Gu, Xieyuanli Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Place recognition is an important task for robots and autonomous cars to localize themselves and close loops in pre-built maps. While single-modal sensor-based methods have shown satisfactory performance, cross-modal place recognition that retrieving images from a point-cloud database remains a challenging problem. Current cross-modal methods transform images into 3D points using depth estimation for modality conversion, which are usually computationally intensive and need expensive labeled data for depth supervision. In this work, we introduce a fast and lightweight framework to encode images and point clouds into place-distinctive descriptors. We propose an effective Field of View (FoV) transformation module to convert point clouds into an analogous modality as images. This module eliminates the necessity for depth estimation and helps subsequent modules achieve real-time performance. We further design a non-negative factorization-based encoder to extract mutually consistent semantic features between point clouds and images. This encoder yields more distinctive global descriptors for retrieval. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while running in real time. Additional evaluation on the HAOMO dataset covering a 17 km trajectory further shows the practical generalization capabilities. We have released the implementation of our methods as open source at: https://github.com/haomo-ai/ModaLink.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Xian, Ganghua Wang, Xuan Bi, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Safeguarding intellectual property and preventing potential misuse of AI-generated images are of paramount importance. This paper introduces a robust and agile plug-and-play watermark detection framework, dubbed as RAW. As a departure from traditional encoder-decoder methods, which incorporate fixed binary codes as watermarks within latent representations, our approach introduces learnable watermarks directly into the original image data. Subsequently, we employ a classifier that is jointly trained with the watermark to detect the presence of the watermark. The proposed framework is compatible with various generative architectures and supports on-the-fly watermark injection after training. By incorporating state-of-the-art smoothing techniques, we show that the framework provides provable guarantees regarding the false positive rate for misclassifying a watermarked image, even in the presence of certain adversarial attacks targeting watermark removal. Experiments on a diverse range of images generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models reveal substantial performance enhancements compared to existing approaches. For instance, our method demonstrates a notable increase in AUROC, from 0.48 to 0.82, when compared to state-of-the-art approaches in detecting watermarked images under adversarial attacks, while maintaining image quality, as indicated by closely aligned FID and CLIP scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenshuang Zhang, Fei Pan, Junmo Kim, In So Kweon, Chengzhi Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: We establish rigorous benchmarks for visual perception robustness. Synthetic images such as ImageNet-C, ImageNet-9, and Stylized ImageNet provide specific type of evaluation over synthetic corruptions, backgrounds, and textures, yet those robustness benchmarks are restricted in specified variations and have low synthetic quality. In this work, we introduce generative model as a data source for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness. Leveraging diffusion models, we are able to generate images with more diversified backgrounds, textures, and materials than any prior work, where we term this benchmark as ImageNet-D. Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4, significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%. Our work suggests that diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenshuang-zhang/imagenet_d.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Luo, Jing Liu, James Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SplatFace, a novel Gaussian splatting framework designed for 3D human face reconstruction without reliance on accurate pre-determined geometry. Our method is designed to simultaneously deliver both high-quality novel view rendering and accurate 3D mesh reconstructions. We incorporate a generic 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior reconstruction quality. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is competitive with both other Gaussian splatting techniques in novel view synthesis and other 3D reconstruction methods in producing 3D face meshes with high geometric precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianfu Wang, Guosheng Hu, Hongguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the pose of objects from images is a crucial task of 3D scene understanding, and recent approaches have shown promising results on very large benchmarks. However, these methods experience a significant performance drop when dealing with unseen objects. We believe that it results from the limited generalizability of image features. To address this problem, we have an in-depth analysis on the features of diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, which hold substantial potential for modeling unseen objects. Based on this analysis, we then innovatively introduce these diffusion features for object pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose three distinct architectures that can effectively capture and aggregate diffusion features of different granularity, greatly improving the generalizability of object pose estimation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin on three popular benchmark datasets, LM, O-LM, and T-LESS. In particular, our method achieves higher accuracy than the previous best arts on unseen objects: 98.2% vs. 93.5% on Unseen LM, 85.9% vs. 76.3% on Unseen O-LM, showing the strong generalizability of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhong Shen, Xuanyu Yi, Zike Wu, Pan Zhou, Hanwang Zhang, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing a 3D asset from a single image with growing demands for automated 3D content creation pipelines. Previous methods primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite their significant success, these approaches encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimization and considerable memory usage. In this report, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end amortized 3D reconstruction model from single-view images, emphasizing two main insights: (1) 3D representation: leveraging a large number of 3D Gaussians for an efficient 3D Gaussian splatting process; (2) Backbone design: introducing a Mamba-based sequential network that facilitates context-dependent reasoning and linear scalability with the sequence (token) length, accommodating a substantial number of Gaussians. Gamba incorporates significant advancements in data preprocessing, regularization design, and training methodologies. We assessed Gamba against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D generation approaches using the real-world scanned OmniObject3D dataset. Here, Gamba demonstrates competitive generation capabilities, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving remarkable speed, approximately 0.6 second on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suraj Patni, Aradhye Agarwal, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: In the absence of parallax cues, a learning-based single image depth estimation (SIDE) model relies heavily on shading and contextual cues in the image. While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such models on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as CLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration from this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information. We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large dataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of generating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based on this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset, achieving Abs Rel error of 0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on KITTI dataset, achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to 0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth). For zero-shot transfer with a model trained on NYUv2, we report mean relative improvement of (20%, 23%, 81%, 25%) over NeWCRFs on (Sun-RGBD, iBims1, DIODE, HyperSim) datasets, compared to (16%, 18%, 45%, 9%) by ZoeDepth.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Siyao, Tianpei Gu, Zhitao Yang, Zhengyu Lin, Ziwei Liu, Henghui Ding, Lei Yang, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm. Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position. To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously. Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Garment3DGen a new method to synthesize 3D garment assets from a base mesh given a single input image as guidance. Our proposed approach allows users to generate 3D textured clothes based on both real and synthetic images, such as those generated by text prompts. The generated assets can be directly draped and simulated on human bodies. First, we leverage the recent progress of image to 3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. Second, we introduce carefully designed losses that allow the input base mesh to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and topology such that they can be simulated. Finally, a texture estimation module generates high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated 3D assets. With Garment3DGen users can generate the textured 3D garment of their choice without the need of artist intervention. One can provide a textual prompt describing the garment they desire to generate a simulation-ready 3D asset. We present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various assets both real and generated and provide use-cases of how one can generate simulation-ready 3D garments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image editing but often generate images that violate physical laws, particularly the effects of objects on the scene, e.g., occlusions, shadows, and reflections. By analyzing the limitations of self-supervised approaches, we propose a practical solution centered on a \q{counterfactual} dataset. Our method involves capturing a scene before and after removing a single object, while minimizing other changes. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on this dataset, we are able to not only remove objects but also their effects on the scene. However, we find that applying this approach for photorealistic object insertion requires an impractically large dataset. To tackle this challenge, we propose bootstrap supervision; leveraging our object removal model trained on a small counterfactual dataset, we synthetically expand this dataset considerably. Our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in photorealistic object removal and insertion, particularly at modeling the effects of objects on the scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shweta Singh, Aayan Yadav, Jitesh Jain, Humphrey Shi, Justin Johnson, Karan Desai</p>
<p>Abstract: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in benchmarking object detectors over the past decade. Like every dataset, COCO contains subtle errors and imperfections stemming from its annotation procedure. With the advent of high-performing models, we ask whether these errors of COCO are hindering its utility in reliably benchmarking further progress. In search for an answer, we inspect thousands of masks from COCO (2017 version) and uncover different types of errors such as imprecise mask boundaries, non-exhaustively annotated instances, and mislabeled masks. Due to the prevalence of COCO, we choose to correct these errors to maintain continuity with prior research. We develop COCO-ReM (Refined Masks), a cleaner set of annotations with visibly better mask quality than COCO-2017. We evaluate fifty object detectors and find that models that predict visually sharper masks score higher on COCO-ReM, affirming that they were being incorrectly penalized due to errors in COCO-2017. Moreover, our models trained using COCO-ReM converge faster and score higher than their larger variants trained using COCO-2017, highlighting the importance of data quality in improving object detectors. With these findings, we advocate using COCO-ReM for future object detection research. Our dataset is available at https://cocorem.xyz</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxing Sun, Rishabh Dabral, Pascal Fua, Christian Theobalt, Marc Habermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Faithful human performance capture and free-view rendering from sparse RGB observations is a long-standing problem in Vision and Graphics. The main challenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the setting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields, which have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and geometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\"ively supervising them on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view inputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and high-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or even a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance field weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve as a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This prior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively addressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure of the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a prior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in a pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes feature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field parameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions as well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views. For evaluating our method under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which contains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse camera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent state-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a predominant assumption is that the data utilized for training and evaluation purposes are drawn from the same distribution. It is also assumed that all data samples are independent and identically distributed ($\displaystyle i.i.d.$). Contrarily, practical implementations often challenge this notion, manifesting data distribution discrepancies, especially in scenarios such as cross-user HAR. Domain adaptation is the promising approach to address these challenges inherent in cross-user HAR tasks. However, a clear gap in domain adaptation techniques is the neglect of the temporal relation embedded within time series data during the phase of aligning data distributions. Addressing this oversight, our research presents the Deep Generative Domain Adaptation with Temporal Attention (DGDATA) method. This novel method uniquely recognises and integrates temporal relations during the domain adaptation process. By synergizing the capabilities of generative models with the Temporal Relation Attention mechanism, our method improves the classification performance in cross-user HAR. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted on three public sensor-based HAR datasets targeting different scenarios and applications to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DGDATA method.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the interlinked biodiversity and climate crises, we need an understanding of where species occur and how these patterns are changing. However, observational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a general model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18035">Bidirectional Consistency Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangchen Li, Jiajun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are capable of generating remarkably high-quality samples by iteratively denoising a random vector, a process that corresponds to moving along the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF ODE). Interestingly, DMs can also invert an input image to noise by moving backward along the PF ODE, a key operation for downstream tasks such as interpolation and image editing. However, the iterative nature of this process restricts its speed, hindering its broader application. Recently, Consistency Models (CMs) have emerged to address this challenge by approximating the integral of the PF ODE, thereby bypassing the need to iterate. Yet, the absence of an explicit ODE solver complicates the inversion process. To resolve this, we introduce the Bidirectional Consistency Model (BCM), which learns a single neural network that enables both forward and backward traversal along the PF ODE, efficiently unifying generation and inversion tasks within one framework. Notably, our proposed method enables one-step generation and inversion while also allowing the use of additional steps to enhance generation quality or reduce reconstruction error. Furthermore, by leveraging our model's bidirectional consistency, we introduce a sampling strategy that can enhance FID while preserving the generated image content. We further showcase our model's capabilities in several downstream tasks, such as interpolation and inpainting, and present demonstrations of potential applications, including blind restoration of compressed images and defending black-box adversarial attacks.</p>

We describe a cascade temporal filtering method to efficiently extract short- and long-term activity in two time dimensions, isochronal and chronological, for use in global path planning and local navigation respectively. The temporal filter has application either independently, or, if object recognition is also required, it can be used as a pre-filter to perform activity-gating of the more computationally expensive neural network processing. For a testbed 32-camera network, we show how this hybrid approach can achieve over 8 times improvement in frames per second throughput and 6.5 times reduction of system power use. We also show how the cost map of static objects in the ROS robot software development framework is augmented with dynamic regions determined from the temporal filter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eva Feillet, Adrian Popescu, C\'eline Hudelot</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning deals with sequential data streams composed of batches of classes. Various algorithms have been proposed to address the challenging case where samples from past classes cannot be stored. However, selecting an appropriate algorithm for a user-defined setting is an open problem, as the relative performance of these algorithms depends on the incremental settings. To solve this problem, we introduce an algorithm recommendation method that simulates the future data stream. Given an initial set of classes, it leverages generative models to simulate future classes from the same visual domain. We evaluate recent algorithms on the simulated stream and recommend the one which performs best in the user-defined incremental setting. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on three large datasets using six algorithms and six incremental settings. Our method outperforms competitive baselines, and performance is close to that of an oracle choosing the best algorithm in each setting. This work contributes to facilitate the practical deployment of incremental learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Shi, Jingwei Zhang, Jun Kong, Fusheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In digital pathology, the multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy is widely used in the weakly supervised histopathology whole slide image (WSI) classification task where giga-pixel WSIs are only labeled at the slide level. However, existing attention-based MIL approaches often overlook contextual information and intrinsic spatial relationships between neighboring tissue tiles, while graph-based MIL frameworks have limited power to recognize the long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce the integrative graph-transformer framework that simultaneously captures the context-aware relational features and global WSI representations through a novel Graph Transformer Integration (GTI) block. Specifically, each GTI block consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer modeling neighboring relations at the local instance level and an efficient global attention model capturing comprehensive global information from extensive feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and BRIGHT, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art MIL methods, achieving an improvement of 1.0% to 2.6% in accuracy and 0.7%-1.6% in AUROC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomically guided PET reconstruction using MRI information has been shown to have the potential to improve PET image quality. However, these improvements are limited to PET scans with paired MRI information. In this work we employed a diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) to infer T1-weighted-MRI (deep-MRI) images from FDG-PET brain images. We then use the DPM-generated T1w-MRI to guide the PET reconstruction. The model was trained with brain FDG scans, and tested in datasets containing multiple levels of counts. Deep-MRI images appeared somewhat degraded than the acquired MRI images. Regarding PET image quality, volume of interest analysis in different brain regions showed that both PET reconstructed images using the acquired and the deep-MRI images improved image quality compared to OSEM. Same conclusions were found analysing the decimated datasets. A subjective evaluation performed by two physicians confirmed that OSEM scored consistently worse than the MRI-guided PET images and no significant differences were observed between the MRI-guided PET images. This proof of concept shows that it is possible to infer DPM-based MRI imagery to guide the PET reconstruction, enabling the possibility of changing reconstruction parameters such as the strength of the prior on anatomically guided PET reconstruction in the absence of MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua C. Zhao, Ahaan Dabholkar, Atul Sharma, Saurabh Bagchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized learning paradigm introduced to preserve privacy of client data. Despite this, prior work has shown that an attacker at the server can still reconstruct the private training data using only the client updates. These attacks are known as data reconstruction attacks and fall into two major categories: gradient inversion (GI) and linear layer leakage attacks (LLL). However, despite demonstrating the effectiveness of these attacks in breaching privacy, prior work has not investigated the usefulness of the reconstructed data for downstream tasks. In this work, we explore data reconstruction attacks through the lens of training and improving models with leaked data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both GI and LLL attacks in maliciously training models using the leaked data more accurately than a benign federated learning strategy. Counter-intuitively, this bump in training quality can occur despite limited reconstruction quality or a small total number of leaked images. Finally, we show the limitations of these attacks for downstream training, individually for GI attacks and for LLL attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Teramoto, Ayano Michiba, Yuka Kiriyama, Tetsuya Tsukamoto, Kazuyoshi Imaizumi, Hiroshi Fujita</p>
<p>Abstract: Cytology plays a crucial role in lung cancer diagnosis. Pulmonary cytology involves cell morphological characterization in the specimen and reporting the corresponding findings, which are extremely burdensome tasks. In this study, we propose a report-generation technique for lung cytology images. In total, 71 benign and 135 malignant pulmonary cytology specimens were collected. Patch images were extracted from the captured specimen images, and the findings were assigned to each image as a dataset for report generation. The proposed method consists of a vision model and a text decoder. In the former, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify a given image as benign or malignant, and the features related to the image are extracted from the intermediate layer. Independent text decoders for benign and malignant cells are prepared for text generation, and the text decoder switches according to the CNN classification results. The text decoder is configured using a Transformer that uses the features obtained from the CNN for report generation. Based on the evaluation results, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.4%, respectively, for automated benign and malignant case classification, and the saliency map indicated characteristic benign and malignant areas. The grammar and style of the generated texts were confirmed as correct and in better agreement with gold standard compared to existing LLM-based image-captioning methods and single-text-decoder ablation model. These results indicate that the proposed method is useful for pulmonary cytology classification and reporting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shun Taguchi, Hideki Deguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to online embedding of multi-scale CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) features into 3D maps. By harnessing CLIP, this methodology surpasses the constraints of conventional vocabulary-limited methods and enables the incorporation of semantic information into the resultant maps. While recent approaches have explored the embedding of multi-modal features in maps, they often impose significant computational costs, lacking practicality for exploring unfamiliar environments in real time. Our approach tackles these challenges by efficiently computing and embedding multi-scale CLIP features, thereby facilitating the exploration of unfamiliar environments through real-time map generation. Moreover, the embedding CLIP features into the resultant maps makes offline retrieval via linguistic queries feasible. In essence, our approach simultaneously achieves real-time object search and mapping of unfamiliar environments. Additionally, we propose a zero-shot object-goal navigation system based on our mapping approach, and we validate its efficacy through object-goal navigation, offline object retrieval, and multi-object-goal navigation in both simulated environments and real robot experiments. The findings demonstrate that our method not only exhibits swifter performance than state-of-the-art mapping methods but also surpasses them in terms of the success rate of object-goal navigation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been significant progress in implementing deep learning models in disease diagnosis using chest X- rays. Despite these advancements, inherent biases in these models can lead to disparities in prediction accuracy across protected groups. In this study, we propose a framework to achieve accurate diagnostic outcomes and ensure fairness across intersectional groups in high-dimensional chest X- ray multi-label classification. Transcending traditional protected attributes, we consider complex interactions within social determinants, enabling a more granular benchmark and evaluation of fairness. We present a simple and robust method that involves retraining the last classification layer of pre-trained models using a balanced dataset across groups. Additionally, we account for fairness constraints and integrate class-balanced fine-tuning for multi-label settings. The evaluation of our method on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an optimal tradeoff between accuracy and fairness compared to baseline methods.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18198">Generative Medical Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Huo, Xi Ouyang, S\'ebastien Ourselin, Rachel Sparks</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in medical image segmentation performance have been significantly driven by the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, these models introduce high computational demands and often have limited ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging datasets. In this manuscript, we introduce Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), a novel approach leveraging a generative model for image segmentation. Concretely, GMS employs a robust pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to derive latent representations of both images and masks, followed by a mapping model that learns the transition from image to mask in the latent space. This process culminates in generating a precise segmentation mask within the image space using the pre-trained VAE decoder. The design of GMS leads to fewer learnable parameters in the model, resulting in a reduced computational burden and enhanced generalization capability. Our extensive experimental analysis across five public datasets in different medical imaging domains demonstrates GMS outperforms existing discriminative segmentation models and has remarkable domain generalization. Our experiments suggest GMS could set a new benchmark for medical image segmentation, offering a scalable and effective solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Harmanani, Paul F. R. Wilson, Fahimeh Fooladgar, Amoon Jamzad, Mahdi Gilany, Minh Nguyen Nhat To, Brian Wodlinger, Purang Abolmaesumi, Parvin Mousavi</p>
<p>Abstract: PURPOSE: Deep learning methods for classifying prostate cancer (PCa) in ultrasound images typically employ convolutional networks (CNNs) to detect cancer in small regions of interest (ROI) along a needle trace region. However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label noise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer classification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier with MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning strategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that for both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones lag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more noticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can improve performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a specificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for modelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust features than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the best architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an effective way to improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for deriving general representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data. However, as real-world applications continually integrate new content, the high computational and resource demands of SSL necessitate continual learning rather than complete retraining. This poses a challenge in striking a balance between stability and plasticity when adapting to new information. In this paper, we employ Centered Kernel Alignment for quantitatively analyzing model stability and plasticity, revealing the critical roles of batch normalization layers for stability and convolutional layers for plasticity. Motivated by this, we propose Branch-tuning, an efficient and straightforward method that achieves a balance between stability and plasticity in continual SSL. Branch-tuning consists of branch expansion and compression, and can be easily applied to various SSL methods without the need of modifying the original methods, retaining old data or models. We validate our method through incremental experiments on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in real-world scenarios. We hope our work offers new insights for future continual self-supervised learning research. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrinivas Ramasubramanian, Harsh Rangwani, Sho Takemori, Kunal Samanta, Yuhei Umeda, Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise in internet usage has led to the generation of massive amounts of data, resulting in the adoption of various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, which can effectively utilize the colossal amount of data to train models. However, before deploying these models in the real world, these must be strictly evaluated on performance measures like worst-case recall and satisfy constraints such as fairness. We find that current state-of-the-art empirical techniques offer sub-optimal performance on these practical, non-decomposable performance objectives. On the other hand, the theoretical techniques necessitate training a new model from scratch for each performance objective. To bridge the gap, we propose SelMix, a selective mixup-based inexpensive fine-tuning technique for pre-trained models, to optimize for the desired objective. The core idea of our framework is to determine a sampling distribution to perform a mixup of features between samples from particular classes such that it optimizes the given objective. We comprehensively evaluate our technique against the existing empirical and theoretically principled methods on standard benchmark datasets for imbalanced classification. We find that proposed SelMix fine-tuning significantly improves the performance for various practical non-decomposable objectives across benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a critical preprocessing step in order to increase the efficiency and the performance of many hyperspectral imaging algorithms. However, dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), suffer from their computationally demanding nature, becoming advisable for their implementation onto high-performance computer architectures for applications under strict latency constraints. This work presents the implementation of the PCA algorithm onto two different high-performance devices, namely, an NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a Kalray manycore, uncovering a highly valuable set of tips and tricks in order to take full advantage of the inherent parallelism of these high-performance computing platforms, and hence, reducing the time that is required to process a given hyperspectral image. Moreover, the achieved results obtained with different hyperspectral images have been compared with the ones that were obtained with a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation of the PCA algorithm that has been recently published, providing, for the first time in the literature, a comprehensive analysis in order to highlight the pros and cons of each option.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinpeng Lu, Jingyun Chen, Linghan Cai, Songhan Jiang, Yongbing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) imaging is routinely used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis by providing complementary information. Automatically segmenting tumors in PET/CT images can significantly improve examination efficiency. Traditional multi-modal segmentation solutions mainly rely on concatenation operations for modality fusion, which fail to effectively model the non-linear dependencies between PET and CT modalities. Recent studies have investigated various approaches to optimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint representations. However, modality-specific encoders used in these methods operate independently, inadequately leveraging the synergistic relationships inherent in PET and CT modalities, for example, the complementarity between semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Interaction and Weighting Network termed H2ASeg to explore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential complementary information. Specifically, we design a Modality-Cooperative Spatial Attention (MCSA) module that performs intra- and inter-modal interactions globally and locally. Additionally, a Target-Aware Modality Weighting (TAMW) module is developed to highlight tumor-related features within multi-modal features, thereby refining tumor segmentation. By embedding these modules across different layers, H2ASeg can hierarchically model cross-modal correlations, enabling a nuanced understanding of both semantic and structural tumor features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of H2ASeg, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on AutoPet-II and Hecktor2022 benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiqi Chen, Yixin Cao, Yan Zhang, Chaochao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from an over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within our framework, we devise a causal graph to elucidate the predictions of MLLMs on VQA problems, and assess the causal effect of biases through an in-depth causal analysis. Motivated by the causal graph, we introduce a novel MORE dataset, consisting of 12,000 VQA instances. This dataset is designed to challenge MLLMs' abilities, necessitating multi-hop reasoning and the surmounting of unimodal biases. Furthermore, we propose two strategies to mitigate unimodal biases and enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, including a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework for limited-access MLLMs and the refinement of open-source MLLMs through fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments offer valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection and analysis of the solar coronal holes (CHs) is an important field of study in the domain of solar physics. Mainly, it is required for the proper prediction of the geomagnetic storms which directly or indirectly affect various space and ground-based systems. For the detection of CHs till date, the solar scientist depends on manual hand-drawn approaches. However, with the advancement of image processing technologies, some automated image segmentation methods have been used for the detection of CHs. In-spite of this, fast and accurate detection of CHs are till a major issues. Here in this work, a novel quantum computing-based fast fuzzy c-mean technique has been developed for fast detection of the CHs region. The task has been carried out in two stages, in first stage the solar image has been segmented using a quantum computing based fast fuzzy c-mean (QCFFCM) and in the later stage the CHs has been extracted out from the segmented image based on image morphological operation. In the work, quantum computing has been used to optimize the cost function of the fast fuzzy c-mean (FFCM) algorithm, where quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been used to optimize the quadratic part of the cost function. The proposed method has been tested for 193 \AA{} SDO/AIA full-disk solar image datasets and has been compared with the existing techniques. The outcome shows the comparable performance of the proposed method with the existing one within a very lesser time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Wu, Velibor Bojkovic, Bin Gu, Kun Suo, Kai Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue for energy-efficient computing compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), closely mirroring biological neural processes. However, this potential comes with inherent challenges in directly training SNNs through spatio-temporal backpropagation -- stemming from the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons and their discrete signal processing -- which necessitates alternative ways of training, most notably through ANN-SNN conversion. In this work, we introduce a lightweight Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) technique, aimed at enhancing conversion accuracy without the computational overhead. We ground our method on provided theoretical findings that through proper temporal bias calibration the expected error of ANN-SNN conversion can be reduced to be zero after each time step. We further propose a heuristic algorithm for finding the temporal bias only in the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of backpropagation and we evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, achieving a notable increase in accuracy on all datasets. Codes are released at a GitHub repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inhwan Bae, Junoh Lee, Hae-Gon Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elmanna, Ahmed Elsafty, Yomna Ahmed, Muhammad Rushdi, Ahmed Morsy</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital pathology has recently been revolutionized by advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and high-performance computing. With its advanced tools, digital pathology can help improve and speed up the diagnostic process, reduce human errors, and streamline the reporting step. In this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and classification. The dataset is a highly diverse dataset of more than 100K RBCs containing eight different classes. The dataset, which is considerably larger than any publicly available hematopathology dataset, was labeled independently by two hematopathologists who also manually created masks for RBC cell segmentation. Subsequently, in the proposed framework, first, a U-Net model was trained to achieve automatic RBC image segmentation. Second, an EfficientNetB0 model was trained to classify RBC images into one of the eight classes using a transfer learning approach with a 5X2 cross-validation scheme. An IoU of 98.03% and an average classification accuracy of 96.5% were attained on the test set. Moreover, we have performed experimental comparisons against several prominent CNN models. These comparisons show the superiority of the proposed model with a good balance between performance and computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Bian, Beth Philips, Tim Cootes, Martin Fergie</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence histology data is emerging as an important method for understanding the tumour micro-environment in cancer. This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers. Distinctively, HEMIT's mIHC images are multi-component and cellular-level aligned with H&E, enriching supervised stain translation tasks. To our knowledge, HEMIT is the first publicly available cellular-level aligned dataset that enables H&E to multi-target mIHC image translation. This dataset provides the computer vision community with a valuable resource to develop novel computational methods which have the potential to gain new insights from H&E slide archives.
  We also propose a new dual-branch generator architecture, using residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin Transformers which achieves better translation outcomes than other popular algorithms. When evaluated on HEMIT, it outperforms pix2pixHD, pix2pix, U-Net, and ResNet, achieving the highest overall score on key metrics including the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Pearson correlation score (R), and Peak signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, downstream analysis has been used to further validate the quality of the generated mIHC images. These results set a new benchmark in the field of stain translation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aissam Djahnine, Alexandre Popoff, Emilien Jupin-Delevaux, Vincent Cottin, Olivier Nempont, Loic Boussel</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pathology detection can be implemented by training a model on healthy data only and measuring the deviation from the training set upon inference, for example with CNN-based feature extraction and one-class classifiers, or reconstruction-score-based methods such as AEs, GANs and Diffusion models. Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the probability distribution of training examples through an invertible architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology detection in chest CT data. Our model is trained unsupervised on healthy 3D pulmonary CT patches, and detects deviations from its log-likelihood distribution as anomalies. We aggregate patches-level likelihood values from a patient's CT scan to provide a patient-level 'normal'/'abnormal' prediction. Out-of-distribution detection performance is evaluated using expert annotations on a separate chest CT test dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siang Chen, Wei Tang, Pengwei Xie, Wenming Yang, Guijin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast and robust object grasping in clutter is a crucial component of robotics. Most current works resort to the whole observed point cloud for 6-Dof grasp generation, ignoring the guidance information excavated from global semantics, thus limiting high-quality grasp generation and real-time performance. In this work, we show that the widely used heatmaps are underestimated in the efficiency of 6-Dof grasp generation. Therefore, we propose an effective local grasp generator combined with grasp heatmaps as guidance, which infers in a global-to-local semantic-to-point way. Specifically, Gaussian encoding and the grid-based strategy are applied to predict grasp heatmaps as guidance to aggregate local points into graspable regions and provide global semantic information. Further, a novel non-uniform anchor sampling mechanism is designed to improve grasp accuracy and diversity. Benefiting from the high-efficiency encoding in the image space and focusing on points in local graspable regions, our framework can perform high-quality grasp detection in real-time and achieve state-of-the-art results. In addition, real robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a success rate of 94% and a clutter completion rate of 100%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas M\"uller, Erwin Quiring</p>
<p>Abstract: Resource efficiency plays an important role for machine learning nowadays. The energy and decision latency are two critical aspects to ensure a sustainable and practical application. Unfortunately, the energy consumption and decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have recently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge examples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision latency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts inputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to accelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these energy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that input uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with mostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a specific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation. Based on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies for crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution and identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We empirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple image classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity effect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation effort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural networks. Finally, we discuss applications of our findings for the good by improving efficiency by increasing sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Zhao, Qingnan Fan, Fei Kou, Shuai Qin, Hong Gu, Wei Wu, Pengcheng Xu, Mingrui Zhu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, instruction-based image editing methods have garnered significant attention in image editing. However, despite encompassing a wide range of editing priors, these methods are helpless when handling editing tasks that are challenging to accurately describe through language. We propose InstructBrush, an inversion method for instruction-based image editing methods to bridge this gap. It extracts editing effects from exemplar image pairs as editing instructions, which are further applied for image editing. Two key techniques are introduced into InstructBrush, Attention-based Instruction Optimization and Transformation-oriented Instruction Initialization, to address the limitations of the previous method in terms of inversion effects and instruction generalization. To explore the ability of instruction inversion methods to guide image editing in open scenarios, we establish a TransformationOriented Paired Benchmark (TOP-Bench), which contains a rich set of scenes and editing types. The creation of this benchmark paves the way for further exploration of instruction inversion. Quantitatively and qualitatively, our approach achieves superior performance in editing and is more semantically consistent with the target editing effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Ibrahim, Hermione Warr, Konstantinos Kamnitsas</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models that can answer questions of the form "How would $x$ change if $y$ had been $z$?" is fundamental for advancing medical image analysis. Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions, though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and that corresponding labels are available in training data. However, clinical data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop, for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.</p>

The methodology entails the initial training of ML models, followed by a fine-tuning phase where irrelevant features identified through explainability methods are eliminated.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafic Nader, Florent Autrusseau, Vincent L'Allinec, Romain Bourcier</p>
<p>Abstract: We hereby present a full synthetic model, able to mimic the various constituents of the cerebral vascular tree: the cerebral arteries, the bifurcations and the intracranial aneurysms. By building this model, our goal was to provide a substantial dataset of brain arteries which could be used by a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to either segment or detect/recognize various vascular diseases (such as artery dissection/thrombosis) or even some portions of the cerebral vasculature, such as the bifurcations or aneurysms. In this study, we will particularly focus on Intra-Cranial Aneurysm (ICA) detection and segmentation. The cerebral aneurysms most often occur on a particular structure of the vascular tree named the Circle of Willis. Various studies have been conducted to detect and monitor the ICAs and those based on Deep Learning (DL) achieve the best performances. Specifically, in this work, we propose a full synthetic 3D model able to mimic the brain vasculature as acquired by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and more particularly the Time Of Flight (TOF) principle. Among the various MRI modalities, the MRA-TOF allows to have a relatively good rendering of the blood vessels and is non-invasive (no contrast liquid injection). Our model has been designed to simultaneously mimic the arteries geometry, the ICA shape and the background noise. The geometry of the vascular tree is modeled thanks to an interpolation with 3D Spline functions, and the statistical properties of the background MRI noise is collected from MRA acquisitions and reproduced within the model. In this work, we thoroughly describe the synthetic vasculature model, we build up a neural network designed for ICA segmentation and detection, and finally, we carry out an in-depth evaluation of the performance gap gained thanks to the synthetic model data augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new dataset called Real Acoustic Fields (RAF) that captures real acoustic room data from multiple modalities. The dataset includes high-quality and densely captured room impulse response data paired with multi-view images, and precise 6DoF pose tracking data for sound emitters and listeners in the rooms. We used this dataset to evaluate existing methods for novel-view acoustic synthesis and impulse response generation which previously relied on synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth) into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic field modeling techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Xing, Zhiyong Feng, Yong Su, Changjae Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to handle the distribution shifts between training and test scenarios. For a new in-distribution (ID) dataset, existing methods require retraining to capture the dataset-specific feature representation or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a deep generative models (DGM) based transferable OOD detection method, which is unnecessary to retrain on a new ID dataset. We design an image erasing strategy to equip exclusive conditional entropy distribution for each ID dataset, which determines the discrepancy of DGM's posteriori ucertainty distribution on different ID datasets. Owing to the powerful representation capacity of convolutional neural networks, the proposed model trained on complex dataset can capture the above discrepancy between ID datasets without retraining and thus achieve transferable OOD detection. We validate the proposed method on five datasets and verity that ours achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art group based OOD detection methods that need to be retrained to deploy on new ID datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanchao Huang, Wei Li, Xiang-Gen Xia, Hao Wang, Ran Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) has been widely applied to locate and classify objects with diverse orientations in remote sensing images. However, the inconsistent features for the localization and classification tasks in AOOD models may lead to ambiguity and low-quality object predictions, which constrains the detection performance. In this article, an AOOD method called task-wise sampling convolutions (TS-Conv) is proposed. TS-Conv adaptively samples task-wise features from respective sensitive regions and maps these features together in alignment to guide a dynamic label assignment for better predictions. Specifically, sampling positions of the localization convolution in TS-Conv are supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB) prediction associated with spatial coordinates, while sampling positions and convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be adaptively adjusted according to different orientations for improving the orientation robustness of features. Furthermore, a dynamic task-consistent-aware label assignment (DTLA) strategy is developed to select optimal candidate positions and assign labels dynamically according to ranked task-aware scores obtained from TS-Conv. Extensive experiments on several public datasets covering multiple scenes, multimodal images, and multiple categories of objects demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and superior performance of the proposed TS-Conv.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Rongyu Zhang, Xiaoqi Li, Xiaowei Chi, Zehui Chen, Ming Lu, Yandong Guo, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-centric bird-eye-view (BEV) perception has shown promising potential in autonomous driving. Recent works mainly focus on improving efficiency or accuracy but neglect the challenges when facing environment changing, resulting in severe degradation of transfer performance. For BEV perception, we figure out the significant domain gaps existing in typical real-world cross-domain scenarios and comprehensively solve the Domain Adaption (DA) problem for multi-view 3D object detection. Since BEV perception approaches are complicated and contain several components, the domain shift accumulation on multiple geometric spaces (i.e., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) makes BEV DA even challenging. In this paper, we propose a Multi-space Alignment Teacher-Student (MATS) framework to ease the domain shift accumulation, which consists of a Depth-Aware Teacher (DAT) and a Geometric-space Aligned Student (GAS) model. DAT tactfully combines target lidar and reliable depth prediction to construct depth-aware information, extracting target domain-specific knowledge in Voxel and BEV feature spaces. It then transfers the sufficient domain knowledge of multiple spaces to the student model. In order to jointly alleviate the domain shift, GAS projects multi-geometric space features to a shared geometric embedding space and decreases data distribution distance between two domains. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct BEV 3D object detection experiments on three cross-domain scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xialei Liu, Jiang-Tian Zhai, Andrew D. Bagdanov, Ke Li, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn tasks with access only to data from the current one. EFCIL is of interest because it mitigates concerns about privacy and long-term storage of data, while at the same time alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning. In this work, we introduce task-adaptive saliency for EFCIL and propose a new framework, which we call Task-Adaptive Saliency Supervision (TASS), for mitigating the negative effects of saliency drift between different tasks. We first apply boundary-guided saliency to maintain task adaptivity and \textit{plasticity} on model attention. Besides, we introduce task-agnostic low-level signals as auxiliary supervision to increase the \textit{stability} of model attention. Finally, we introduce a module for injecting and recovering saliency noise to increase the robustness of saliency preservation. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can better preserve saliency maps across tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset EFCIL benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yu, Zheng Qin, Ji Hou, Mahdi Saleh, Dongsheng Li, Benjamin Busam, Slobodan Ilic</p>
<p>Abstract: The intrinsic rotation invariance lies at the core of matching point clouds with handcrafted descriptors. However, it is widely despised by recent deep matchers that obtain the rotation invariance extrinsically via data augmentation. As the finite number of augmented rotations can never span the continuous SO(3) space, these methods usually show instability when facing rotations that are rarely seen. To this end, we introduce RoITr, a Rotation-Invariant Transformer to cope with the pose variations in the point cloud matching task. We contribute both on the local and global levels. Starting from the local level, we introduce an attention mechanism embedded with Point Pair Feature (PPF)-based coordinates to describe the pose-invariant geometry, upon which a novel attention-based encoder-decoder architecture is constructed. We further propose a global transformer with rotation-invariant cross-frame spatial awareness learned by the self-attention mechanism, which significantly improves the feature distinctiveness and makes the model robust with respect to the low overlap. Experiments are conducted on both the rigid and non-rigid public benchmarks, where RoITr outperforms all the state-of-the-art models by a considerable margin in the low-overlapping scenarios. Especially when the rotations are enlarged on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark, RoITr surpasses the existing methods by at least 13 and 5 percentage points in terms of Inlier Ratio and Registration Recall, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incorporating human feedback has been shown to be crucial to align text generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-to-event prediction, e.g. cancer survival analysis or hospital length of stay, is a highly prominent machine learning task in medical and healthcare applications. However, only a few interpretable machine learning methods comply with its challenges. To facilitate a comprehensive explanatory analysis of survival models, we formally introduce time-dependent feature effects and global feature importance explanations. We show how post-hoc interpretation methods allow for finding biases in AI systems predicting length of stay using a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 X-ray images with textual radiology reports annotated by human experts. Moreover, we evaluate cancer survival models beyond predictive performance to include the importance of multi-omics feature groups based on a large-scale benchmark comprising 11 datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Model developers can use the proposed methods to debug and improve machine learning algorithms, while physicians can discover disease biomarkers and assess their significance. We hope the contributed open data and code resources facilitate future work in the emerging research direction of explainable survival analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixin Wang, Jianlong Chang, Xiao Luo, Jinan Sun, Zhouchen Lin, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent competitive performance across a range of vision tasks, vision Transformers still have an issue of heavy computational costs. Recently, vision prompt learning has provided an economic solution to this problem without fine-tuning the whole large-scale models. However, the efficiency of existing models are still far from satisfactory due to insertion of extensive prompts blocks and trick prompt designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient vision model named impLicit vIsion prOmpt tuNing (LION), which is motivated by deep implicit models with stable memory costs for various complex tasks. In particular, we merely insect two equilibrium implicit layers in two ends of the pre-trained main backbone with parameters in the backbone frozen. Moreover, we prune the parameters in these two layers according to lottery hypothesis. The performance obtained by our LION are promising on a wide range of datasets. In particular, our LION reduces up to 11.5% of training parameter numbers while obtaining higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art baseline VPT, especially under challenging scenes. Furthermore, we find that our proposed LION had a good generalization performance, making it an easy way to boost transfer learning in the future.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14394">Unified Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for Single- and Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Chen, Ben Kang, Jiawen Zhu, Dong Wang, Houwen Peng, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new sequence-to-sequence learning framework for RGB-based and multi-modal object tracking. First, we present SeqTrack for RGB-based tracking. It casts visual tracking as a sequence generation task, forecasting object bounding boxes in an autoregressive manner. This differs from previous trackers, which depend on the design of intricate head networks, such as classification and regression heads. SeqTrack employs a basic encoder-decoder transformer architecture. The encoder utilizes a bidirectional transformer for feature extraction, while the decoder generates bounding box sequences autoregressively using a causal transformer. The loss function is a plain cross-entropy. Second, we introduce SeqTrackv2, a unified sequence-to-sequence framework for multi-modal tracking tasks. Expanding upon SeqTrack, SeqTrackv2 integrates a unified interface for auxiliary modalities and a set of task-prompt tokens to specify the task. This enables it to manage multi-modal tracking tasks using a unified model and parameter set. This sequence learning paradigm not only simplifies the tracking framework, but also showcases superior performance across 14 challenging benchmarks spanning five single- and multi-modal tracking tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Lepage, J\'er\'emie Mary, David Picard</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new challenge for image similarity search in the context of fashion, addressing the inherent ambiguity in this domain stemming from complex images. We present Referred Visual Search (RVS), a task allowing users to define more precisely the desired similarity, following recent interest in the industry. We release a new large public dataset, LAION-RVS-Fashion, consisting of 272k fashion products with 842k images extracted from LAION, designed explicitly for this task. However, unlike traditional visual search methods in the industry, we demonstrate that superior performance can be achieved by bypassing explicit object detection and adopting weakly-supervised conditional contrastive learning on image tuples. Our method is lightweight and demonstrates robustness, reaching Recall at one superior to strong detection-based baselines against 2M distractors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Senqiao Yang, Peidong Jia, Renrui Zhang, Ming Lu, Yandong Guo, Wei Xue, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Since real-world machine systems are running in non-stationary environments, Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task is proposed to adapt the pre-trained model to continually changing target domains. Recently, existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation, which aims to leverage a self-training manner to extract the target domain knowledge. However, pseudo labels can be noisy and the updated model parameters are unreliable under dynamic data distributions, leading to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in the continual adaptation process. To tackle these challenges and maintain the model plasticity, we design a Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA, explicitly handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge. Specifically, we first comprehensively explore the different domain representations of the adapters with trainable high-rank or low-rank embedding spaces. Then we inject ViDAs into the pre-trained model, which leverages high-rank and low-rank features to adapt the current domain distribution and maintain the continual domain-shared knowledge, respectively. To exploit the low-rank and high-rank ViDAs more effectively, we further propose a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Note that, our method can be regarded as a novel transfer paradigm for large-scale models, delivering promising results in adaptation to continually changing distributions.

<p>Abstract: The study of complex human interactions and group activities has become a focal point in human-centric computer vision. However, progress in related tasks is often hindered by the challenges of obtaining large-scale labeled datasets from real-world scenarios. To address the limitation, we introduce M3Act, a synthetic data generator for multi-view multi-group multi-person human atomic actions and group activities. Powered by Unity Engine, M3Act features multiple semantic groups, highly diverse and photorealistic images, and a comprehensive set of annotations, which facilitates the learning of human-centered tasks across single-person, multi-person, and multi-group conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of M3Act across three core experiments. The results suggest our synthetic dataset can significantly improve the performance of several downstream methods and replace real-world datasets to reduce cost. Notably, M3Act improves the state-of-the-art MOTRv2 on DanceTrack dataset, leading to a hop on the leaderboard from 10th to 2nd place. Moreover, M3Act opens new research for controllable 3D group activity generation. We define multiple metrics and propose a competitive baseline for the novel task.

<p>Abstract: We present the first neural network that has learned to compactly represent and can efficiently reconstruct the statistical dependencies between the values of physical variables at different spatial locations in large 3D simulation ensembles. Going beyond linear dependencies, we consider mutual information as a measure of non-linear dependence. We demonstrate learning and reconstruction with a large weather forecast ensemble comprising 1000 members, each storing multiple physical variables at a 250 x 352 x 20 simulation grid. By circumventing compute-intensive statistical estimators at runtime, we demonstrate significantly reduced memory and computation requirements for reconstructing the major dependence structures. This enables embedding the estimator into a GPU-accelerated direct volume renderer and interactively visualizing all mutual dependencies for a selected domain point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haeil Lee, Hansang Lee, Junmo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed Sample Data Augmentation (MSDA) techniques, such as Mixup, CutMix, and PuzzleMix, have been widely acknowledged for enhancing performance in a variety of tasks. A previous study reported the class dependency of traditional data augmentation (DA), where certain classes benefit disproportionately compared to others. This paper reveals a class dependent effect of MSDA, where some classes experience improved performance while others experience degraded performance. This research addresses the issue of class dependency in MSDA and proposes an algorithm to mitigate it. The approach involves training on a mixture of MSDA and non-MSDA data, which not only mitigates the negative impact on the affected classes, but also improves overall accuracy. Furthermore, we provide in-depth analysis and discussion of why MSDA introduced class dependencies and which classes are most likely to have them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanay Rastogi, M{\aa}rten Bj\"orkman</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-space diagrams are essential tools for analyzing traffic patterns and optimizing transportation infrastructure and traffic management strategies. Traditional data collection methods for these diagrams have limitations in terms of temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advancements in camera technology have overcome these limitations and provided extensive urban data. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to constructing time-space diagrams by utilizing street-view video sequences captured by cameras mounted on moving vehicles. Using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5, StrongSORT, and photogrammetry techniques for distance calculation, we can infer vehicle trajectories from the video data and generate time-space diagrams. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we utilized datasets from the KITTI computer vision benchmark suite. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can generate trajectories from video data, although there are some errors that can be mitigated by improving the performance of the detector, tracker, and distance calculation components. In conclusion, the utilization of street-view video sequences captured by cameras mounted on moving vehicles, combined with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, has immense potential for constructing comprehensive time-space diagrams. These diagrams offer valuable insights into traffic patterns and contribute to the design of transportation infrastructure and traffic management strategies.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16421">Distilling ODE Solvers of Diffusion Models into Smaller Steps</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghwan Kim, Hao Tang, Fisher Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract Diffusion models have recently gained prominence as a novel category of generative models. Despite their success, these models face a notable drawback in terms of slow sampling speeds, requiring a high number of function evaluations (NFE) in the order of hundreds or thousands. In response, both learning-free and learning-based sampling strategies have been explored to expedite the sampling process. Learning-free sampling employs various ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers based on the formulation of diffusion ODEs. However, it encounters challenges in faithfully tracking the true sampling trajectory, particularly for small NFE. Conversely, learning-based sampling methods, such as knowledge distillation, demand extensive additional training, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Distilled-ODE solvers (D-ODE solvers), a straightforward distillation approach grounded in ODE solver formulations. Our method seamlessly integrates the strengths of both learning-free and learning-based sampling. D-ODE solvers are constructed by introducing a single parameter adjustment to existing ODE solvers. Furthermore, we optimize D-ODE solvers with smaller steps using knowledge distillation from ODE solvers with larger steps across a batch of samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of D-ODE solvers compared to existing ODE solvers, including DDIM, PNDM, DPM-Solver, DEIS, and EDM, particularly in scenarios with fewer NFE. Notably, our method incurs negligible computational overhead compared to previous distillation techniques, facilitating straightforward and rapid integration with existing samplers. Qualitative analysis reveals that D-ODE solvers not only enhance image quality but also faithfully follow the target ODE trajectory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation in adverse weather scenarios is a critical task for autonomous driving systems. While foundation models have shown promise, the need for specialized adaptors becomes evident for handling more challenging scenarios. We introduce DiffPrompter, a novel differentiable visual and latent prompting mechanism aimed at expanding the learning capabilities of existing adaptors in foundation models. Our proposed $\nabla$HFC image processing block excels particularly in adverse weather conditions, where conventional methods often fall short. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages of jointly training visual and latent prompts, demonstrating that this combined approach significantly enhances performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. Our differentiable visual prompts leverage parallel and series architectures to generate prompts, effectively improving object segmentation tasks in adverse conditions. Through a comprehensive series of experiments and evaluations, we provide empirical evidence to support the efficacy of our approach. Project page at https://diffprompter.github.io.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08106">Generalized Logit Adjustment: Calibrating Fine-tuned Models by Removing Label Bias in Foundation Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Beier Zhu, Kaihua Tang, Qianru Sun, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maomao Li, Ge Yuan, Cairong Wang, Zhian Liu, Yong Zhang, Yongwei Nie, Jue Wang, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to face swapping from the perspective of fine-grained facial editing, dubbed "editing for swapping" (E4S). The traditional face swapping methods rely on global feature extraction and fail to preserve the detailed source identity. In contrast, we propose a Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method, which allows the explicit disentanglement of shape and texture. Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to project the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a mask-guided injection module manipulating feature maps with the style codes. Based on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and mask swapping. Besides, due to the large lighting condition gap, transferring the source skin into the target image may lead to disharmony lighting. We propose a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the target lighting condition while preserving the source skin. Further, to deal with the potential mismatch areas during mask exchange, we design a face inpainting module to refine the face shape. The extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our E4S outperforms existing methods in preserving texture, shape, and lighting. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/e4s2024/E4S2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Amin Mansour, Hehui Zheng, Robert K. Katzschmann</p>
<p>Abstract: The world around us is full of soft objects we perceive and deform with dexterous hand movements. For a robotic hand to control soft objects, it has to acquire online state feedback of the deforming object. While RGB-D cameras can collect occluded point clouds at a rate of 30Hz, this does not represent a continuously trackable object surface. Hence, in this work, we developed a method that takes as input a template mesh which is the mesh of an object in its non-deformed state and a deformed point cloud of the same object, and then shapes the template mesh such that it matches the deformed point cloud. The reconstruction of meshes from point clouds has long been studied in the field of Computer graphics under 3D reconstruction and 4D reconstruction, however, both lack the speed and generalizability needed for robotics applications. Our model is designed using a point cloud auto-encoder and a Real-NVP architecture. Our trained model can perform mesh reconstruction and tracking at a rate of 58Hz on a template mesh of 3000 vertices and a deformed point cloud of 5000 points and is generalizable to the deformations of six different object categories which are assumed to be made of soft material in our experiments (scissors, hammer, foam brick, cleanser bottle, orange, and dice). The object meshes are taken from the YCB benchmark dataset. An instance of a downstream application can be the control algorithm for a robotic hand that requires online feedback from the state of the manipulated object which would allow online grasp adaptation in a closed-loop manner. Furthermore, the tracking capacity of our method can help in the system identification of deforming objects in a marker-free approach. In future work, we will extend our trained model to generalize beyond six object categories and additionally to real-world deforming point clouds.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new interaction mechanism of prediction and planning for end-to-end autonomous driving, called PPAD (Iterative Interaction of Prediction and Planning Autonomous Driving), which considers the timestep-wise interaction to better integrate prediction and planning. An ego vehicle performs motion planning at each timestep based on the trajectory prediction of surrounding agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and its local road conditions. Unlike existing end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks, PPAD models the interactions among ego, agents, and the dynamic environment in an autoregressive manner by interleaving the Prediction and Planning processes at every timestep, instead of a single sequential process of prediction followed by planning. Specifically, we design ego-to-agent, ego-to-map, and ego-to-BEV interaction mechanisms with hierarchical dynamic key objects attention to better model the interactions. The experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in clinical treatment are increasingly constrained by the limitations of supervised learning techniques, which depend heavily on large volumes of annotated data. The annotation process is not only costly but also demands substantial time from clinical specialists. Addressing this issue, we introduce the S4MI (Self-Supervision and Semi-Supervision for Medical Imaging) pipeline, a novel approach that leverages advancements in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning. These techniques engage in auxiliary tasks that do not require labeling, thus simplifying the scaling of machine supervision compared to fully-supervised methods. Our study benchmarks these techniques on three distinct medical imaging datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in classification and segmentation tasks. Notably, we observed that self supervised learning significantly surpassed the performance of supervised methods in the classification of all evaluated datasets. Remarkably, the semi-supervised approach demonstrated superior outcomes in segmentation, outperforming fully-supervised methods while using 50% fewer labels across all datasets. In line with our commitment to contributing to the scientific community, we have made the S4MI code openly accessible, allowing for broader application and further development of these methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and generated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in both image generation quality and controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Mengyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Pichao Wang, Jialun Cai, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with respect to example boxes or class names, \emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot counting. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting based on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two foundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\textbf{i}) SAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\textbf{ii}) CLIP to classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework, termed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental results on FSC-147, COCO, and LVIS demonstrate that PseCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object counting/detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Herau, Nathan Piasco, Moussab Bennehar, Luis Rold\~ao, Dzmitry Tsishkou, Cyrille Migniot, Pascal Vasseur, C\'edric Demonceaux</p>
<p>Abstract: In rapidly-evolving domains such as autonomous driving, the use of multiple sensors with different modalities is crucial to ensure high operational precision and stability. To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhi Wang, Jingbo Wang, Yixuan Li, Dahua Lin, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-conditioned human motion synthesis has made remarkable progress with the emergence of diffusion models in recent research. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for a single character and overlook multi-human interactions. In our approach, we strive to explore this problem by synthesizing human motion with interactions for a group of characters of any size. The key aspect of our approach is the adaptation of human-wise interactions as pairs of human joints that can be either in contact or separated by a desired distance. In contrast to existing methods that necessitate training motion generation models on multi-human motion datasets with a fixed number of characters, our approach inherently possesses the flexibility to model human interactions involving an arbitrary number of individuals, thereby transcending the limitations imposed by the training data. We introduce a novel controllable motion generation method, InterControl, to encourage the synthesized motions maintaining the desired distance between joint pairs. It consists of a motion controller and an inverse kinematics guidance module that realistically and accurately aligns the joints of synthesized characters to the desired location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distance between joint pairs for human-wise interactions can be generated using an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM). Experimental results highlight the capability of our framework to generate interactions with multiple human characters and its potential to work with off-the-shelf physics-based character simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuming Liu, Guangming Wang, Weicai Ye, Chaokang Jiang, Jinru Han, Zhe Liu, Guofeng Zhang, Dalong Du, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation, which aims to predict per-point 3D displacements of dynamic scenes, is a fundamental task in the computer vision field. However, previous works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally constrained searching ranges, and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising from the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the diffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed to enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases, e.g. dynamics, noisy inputs, repetitive patterns, etc. To restrain the generation diversity, three key flow-related features are leveraged as conditions in our diffusion model. Furthermore, we also develop an uncertainty estimation module within diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated scene flow. Our DifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 24.0% and 29.1% EPE3D reduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets. Notably, our method achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy (0.0078m in EPE3D) on the KITTI dataset. Additionally, our diffusion-based refinement paradigm can be readily integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing scene flow networks, significantly increasing their estimation accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingqun Qi, Jiahao Pan, Peng Li, Ruibin Yuan, Xiaowei Chi, Mengfei Li, Wenhan Luo, Wei Xue, Shanghang Zhang, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating vivid and emotional 3D co-speech gestures is crucial for virtual avatar animation in human-machine interaction applications. While the existing methods enable generating the gestures to follow a single emotion label, they overlook that long gesture sequence modeling with emotion transition is more practical in real scenes. In addition, the lack of large-scale available datasets with emotional transition speech and corresponding 3D human gestures also limits the addressing of this task. To fulfill this goal, we first incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted emotion transition audio is extremely difficult, we propose a novel weakly supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of transition gestures w.r.t different emotional ones, we model the temporal association representation between two different emotional gesture sequences as style guidance and infuse it into the transition generation. We further devise an emotion mixture mechanism that provides weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion label for transition gestures. Last, we present a keyframe sampler to supply effective initial posture cues in long sequences, enabling us to generate diverse gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models constructed by adapting single emotion-conditioned counterparts on our newly defined emotion transition task and datasets. Our code and dataset will be released on the project page: https://xingqunqi-lab.github.io/Emo-Transition-Gesture/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Wimmer, Peter Wonka, Maks Ovsjanikov</p>
<p>Abstract: With the immense growth of dataset sizes and computing resources in recent years, so-called foundation models have become popular in NLP and vision tasks. In this work, we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization accuracy. To address this problem, we propose, first, to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models. Second, we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet dataset, almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Du, Miaojing Shi, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting objects in low-light scenarios presents a persistent challenge, as detectors trained on well-lit data exhibit significant performance degradation on low-light data due to low visibility. Previous methods mitigate this issue by exploring image enhancement or object detection techniques with real low-light image datasets. However, the progress is impeded by the inherent difficulties about collecting and annotating low-light images. To address this challenge, we propose to boost low-light object detection with zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which aims to generalize a detector from well-lit scenarios to low-light ones without requiring real low-light data. Revisiting Retinex theory in the low-level vision, we first design a reflectance representation learning module to learn Retinex-based illumination invariance in images with a carefully designed illumination invariance reinforcement strategy. Next, an interchange-redecomposition-coherence procedure is introduced to improve over the vanilla Retinex image decomposition process by performing two sequential image decompositions and introducing a redecomposition cohering loss. Extensive experiments on ExDark, DARK FACE, and CODaN datasets show strong low-light generalizability of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZPDu/DAI-Net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfei Fan, Tianyu Zhao, Guidong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accuracy and computational efficiency are the most important metrics to Visual Inertial Navigation System (VINS). The existing VINS algorithms with either high accuracy or low computational complexity, are difficult to provide the high precision localization in resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a novel filter-based VINS framework named SchurVINS, which could guarantee both high accuracy by building a complete residual model and low computational complexity with Schur complement. Technically, we first formulate the full residual model where Gradient, Hessian and observation covariance are explicitly modeled. Then Schur complement is employed to decompose the full model into ego-motion residual model and landmark residual model. Finally, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update is implemented in these two models with high efficiency. Experiments on EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets show that our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and computational complexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Ximeng Sun, Bryan A. Plummer, Kate Saenko, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose interfaces for many machine learning problems. Recent work has adapted LLMs to generative visual tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual chat, using a relatively small amount of instruction-tuning data. In this paper, we explore whether modern LLMs can also be adapted to classifying an image into a set of categories. First, we evaluate multimodal LLMs that are tuned for generative tasks on zero-shot image classification and find that their performance is far below that of specialized models like CLIP. We then propose an approach for light fine-tuning of LLMs using the same contrastive image-caption matching objective as CLIP. Our results show that LLMs can, indeed, achieve good image classification performance when adapted this way. Our approach beats state-of-the-art mLLMs by 13% and slightly outperforms contrastive learning with a custom text model, while also retaining the LLM's generative abilities. LLM initialization appears to particularly help classification in domains under-represented in the visual pre-training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Keetha, Jay Karhade, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Gengshan Yang, Sebastian Scherer, Deva Ramanan, Jonathon Luiten</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current methods are often hampered by the non-volumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a single unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2x superior performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Gopalakrishnan, Neel Dey, Polina Golland</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical decisions are informed by aligning rapid portable 2D intraoperative images (e.g., X-rays) to a high-fidelity 3D preoperative reference scan (e.g., CT). 2D/3D image registration often fails in practice: conventional optimization methods are prohibitively slow and susceptible to local minima, while neural networks trained on small datasets fail on new patients or require impractical landmark supervision. We present DiffPose, a self-supervised approach that leverages patient-specific simulation and differentiable physics-based rendering to achieve accurate 2D/3D registration without relying on manually labeled data. Preoperatively, a CNN is trained to regress the pose of a randomly oriented synthetic X-ray rendered from the preoperative CT. The CNN then initializes rapid intraoperative test-time optimization that uses the differentiable X-ray renderer to refine the solution. Our work further proposes several geometrically principled methods for sampling camera poses from $\mathbf{SE}(3)$, for sparse differentiable rendering, and for driving registration in the tangent space $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ with geodesic and multiscale locality-sensitive losses. DiffPose achieves sub-millimeter accuracy across surgical datasets at intraoperative speeds, improving upon existing unsupervised methods by an order of magnitude and even outperforming supervised baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Yang, Patrick Pfreundschuh, Roland Siegwart, Marco Hutter, Peyman Moghadam, Vaishakh Patil</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR Upsampling is a challenging task for the perception systems of robots and autonomous vehicles, due to the sparse and irregular structure of large-scale scene contexts. Recent works propose to solve this problem by converting LiDAR data from 3D Euclidean space into an image super-resolution problem in 2D image space. Although their methods can generate high-resolution range images with fine-grained details, the resulting 3D point clouds often blur out details and predict invalid points. In this paper, we propose TULIP, a new method to reconstruct high-resolution LiDAR point clouds from low-resolution LiDAR input. We also follow a range image-based approach but specifically modify the patch and window geometries of a Swin-Transformer-based network to better fit the characteristics of range images. We conducted several experiments on three public real-world and simulated datasets. TULIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all relevant metrics and generates robust and more realistic point clouds than prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Gu, Zhichao Sun, Tian Chen, Xin Xiao, Yepeng Liu, Yongchao Xu, Laurent Najman</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. The key is how to leverage unlabeled images in the training process. Most methods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under variations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions) in the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images often have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as the image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Motivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in structure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast invariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a novel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e. connected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in two filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the proposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their erroneous predictions on unlabeled images. This helps to alleviate the confirmation bias issue of overfitting to noisy pseudo labels of unlabeled images, and thus effectively improves the segmentation performance. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly/consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art methods. The source codes will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is a long-lasting goal to design an embodied system that can solve long-horizon open-world tasks in human-like ways. However, existing approaches usually struggle with compound difficulties caused by the logic-aware decomposition and context-aware execution of these tasks. To this end, we introduce MP5, an open-ended multimodal embodied system built upon the challenging Minecraft simulator, which can decompose feasible sub-objectives, design sophisticated situation-aware plans, and perform embodied action control, with frequent communication with a goal-conditioned active perception scheme. Specifically, MP5 is developed on top of recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and the system is modulated into functional modules that can be scheduled and collaborated to ultimately solve pre-defined context- and process-dependent tasks. Extensive experiments prove that MP5 can achieve a 22% success rate on difficult process-dependent tasks and a 91% success rate on tasks that heavily depend on the context. Moreover, MP5 exhibits a remarkable ability to address many open-ended tasks that are entirely novel.</p>

Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin.

<p>Abstract: Endometrial cancer, the fourth most common cancer in females in the United States, with the lifetime risk for developing this disease is approximately 2.8% in women. Precise histologic evaluation and molecular classification of endometrial cancer is important for effective patient management and determining the best treatment modalities. This study introduces EndoNet, which uses convolutional neural networks for extracting histologic features and a vision transformer for aggregating these features and classifying slides based on their visual characteristics into high- and low- grade. The model was trained on 929 digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images of endometrial cancer from hysterectomy cases at Dartmouth-Health. It classifies these slides into low-grade (Endometroid Grades 1 and 2) and high-grade (endometroid carcinoma FIGO grade 3, uterine serous carcinoma, carcinosarcoma) categories. EndoNet was evaluated on an internal test set of 110 patients and an external test set of 100 patients from the public TCGA database. The model achieved a weighted average F1-score of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) and an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99) on the internal test, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.94) for F1-score and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75-0.93) for AUC on the external test. Pending further validation, EndoNet has the potential to support pathologists without the need of manual annotations in classifying the grades of gynecologic pathology tumors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research into dynamic 3D scene understanding has primarily focused on short-term change tracking from dense observations, while little attention has been paid to long-term changes with sparse observations. We address this gap with MoRE, a novel approach for multi-object relocalization and reconstruction in evolving environments. We view these environments as "living scenes" and consider the problem of transforming scans taken at different points in time into a 3D reconstruction of the object instances, whose accuracy and completeness increase over time. At the core of our method lies an SE(3)-equivariant representation in a single encoder-decoder network, trained on synthetic data. This representation enables us to seamlessly tackle instance matching, registration, and reconstruction. We also introduce a joint optimization algorithm that facilitates the accumulation of point clouds originating from the same instance across multiple scans taken at different points in time. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both end-to-end performance and individual subtasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forests are an essential part of Earth's ecosystems and natural systems, as well as providing services on which humanity depends, yet they are rapidly changing as a result of land use decisions and climate change. Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and recently many such problems have been approached using machine learning algorithms for remote sensing. To date, forest-monitoring problems have largely been addressed in isolation. Inspired by the rise of foundation models for computer vision and remote sensing, we here present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench). FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To further enhance the diversity of tasks and geographies represented in FoMo-Bench, we introduce a novel global dataset, TalloS, combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification, encompassing 1,000+ categories across multiple hierarchical taxonomic levels (species, genus, family). Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a baseline foundation model with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used spectral bands in remote sensing, across diverse ground sampling distances and geographical locations worldwide. This work aims to inspire research collaborations between machine learning and forest biology researchers in exploring scalable multi-modal and multi-task models for forest monitoring. All code and data will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Monika Wysocza\'nska, Oriane Sim\'eoni, Micha\"el Ramamonjisoa, Andrei Bursuc, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Patrick P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: The popular CLIP model displays impressive zero-shot capabilities thanks to its seamless interaction with arbitrary text prompts. However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Ran Xu, Senqiao Yang, Renrui Zhang, Qizhe Zhang, Zehui Chen, Yandong Guo, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is proposed to migrate a source pre-trained model to continually changing target distributions, addressing real-world dynamism. Existing CTTA methods mainly rely on entropy minimization or teacher-student pseudo-labeling schemes for knowledge extraction in unlabeled target domains. However, dynamic data distributions cause miscalibrated predictions and noisy pseudo-labels in existing self-supervised learning methods, hindering the effective mitigation of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting problems during the continual adaptation process. To tackle these issues, we propose a continual self-supervised method, Adaptive Distribution Masked Autoencoders (ADMA), which enhances the extraction of target domain knowledge while mitigating the accumulation of distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose a Distribution-aware Masking (DaM) mechanism to adaptively sample masked positions, followed by establishing consistency constraints between the masked target samples and the original target samples. Additionally, for masked tokens, we utilize an efficient decoder to reconstruct a hand-crafted feature descriptor (e.g., Histograms of Oriented Gradients), leveraging its invariant properties to boost task-relevant representations. Through conducting extensive experiments on four widely recognized benchmarks, our proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxiang Cao, Jie Lei, Weiying Xie, Jiaqing Zhang, Daixun Li, Yunsong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant progress in object detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Existing methods, while achieving promising results, often struggle to effectively integrate local and global information, particularly direction-aware features. This paper proposes SAR-Net, a novel framework specifically designed for global fusion of direction-aware information in SAR object detection. SAR-Net leverages two key innovations: the Unity Compensation Mechanism (UCM) and the Direction-aware Attention Module (DAM). UCM facilitates the establishment of complementary relationships among features across different scales, enabling efficient global information fusion. Among them, Multi-scale Alignment Module (MAM) and distinct Multi-level Fusion Module (MFM) enhance feature integration by capturing both texture detail and semantic information. Then, Multi-feature Embedding Module (MEM) feeds back global features into the primary branches, further improving information transmission. Additionally, DAM, through bidirectional attention polymerization, captures direction-aware information, effectively eliminating background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SAR-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results on aircraft (SAR-AIRcraft-1.0) and ship datasets (SSDD, HRSID), confirming its generalization capability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Liu, Zihao Zhu, Giorgio Becherini, Yichen Peng, Mingyang Su, You Zhou, Xuefei Zhe, Naoya Iwamoto, Bo Zheng, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose EMAGE, a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio and masked gestures, encompassing facial, local body, hands, and global movements. To achieve this, we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME), a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines MoShed SMPLX body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head, neck, and finger movements, offering a community-standardized, high-quality 3D motion captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer, facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover, EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs, generating complete, audio-synchronized results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan-Niklas Dihlmann, Andreas Engelhardt, Hendrik Lensch</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Pan, Zeyu Yang, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. Extending image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling, existing methods tend to be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly train a novel 4D Gaussian splatting model with explicit point cloud geometry, enabling real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 20-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 6 mins to model a dynamic object, vs 120 mins by Consistent4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhen Zhu, James Z. Wang, Wonseuk Lee, Brad Wyble</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual learning often occurs in a specific context, where an agent acquires skills through exploration and tracking of its location in a consistent environment. The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach, termed Environmental Spatial Similarity (ESS), that complements existing contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on extensive, disconnected datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Kriuk, Fedor Kriuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging problem for machine learning researchers. Unlike printed text data, handwritten character datasets have more variation due to human-introduced bias. With numerous unique character classes present, some data, such as Logographic Scripts or Sino-Korean character sequences, bring new complications to the HCR problem. The classification task on such datasets requires the model to learn high-complexity details of the images that share similar features. With recent advances in computational resource availability and further computer vision theory development, some research teams have effectively addressed the arising challenges. Although known for achieving high accuracy while keeping the number of parameters small, many common approaches are still not generalizable and use dataset-specific solutions to achieve better results. Due to complex structure, existing methods frequently prevent the solutions from gaining popularity. This paper proposes a highly scalable approach for detailed character image classification by introducing the model architecture, data preprocessing steps, and testing design instructions. We also perform experiments to compare the performance of our method with that of existing ones to show the improvements achieved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Ricker, Denis Lukovnikov, Asja Fischer</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent text-to-image models, anyone can generate deceptively realistic images with arbitrary contents, fueling the growing threat of visual disinformation. A key enabler for generating high-resolution images with low computational cost has been the development of latent diffusion models (LDMs). In contrast to conventional diffusion models, LDMs perform the denoising process in the low-dimensional latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder (AE) instead of the high-dimensional image space. Despite their relevance, the forensic analysis of LDMs is still in its infancy. In this work we propose AEROBLADE, a novel detection method which exploits an inherent component of LDMs: the AE used to transform images between image and latent space. We find that generated images can be more accurately reconstructed by the AE than real images, allowing for a simple detection approach based on the reconstruction error. Most importantly, our method is easy to implement and does not require any training, yet nearly matches the performance of detectors that rely on extensive training. We empirically demonstrate that AEROBLADE is effective against state-of-the-art LDMs, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Beyond detection, our approach allows for the qualitative analysis of images, which can be leveraged for identifying inpainted regions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kihong Kim, Haneol Lee, Jihye Park, Seyeon Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Seungryong Kim, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality videos that synthesize desired realistic content is a challenging task due to their intricate high-dimensionality and complexity of videos. Several recent diffusion-based methods have shown comparable performance by compressing videos to a lower-dimensional latent space, using traditional video autoencoder architecture. However, such method that employ standard frame-wise 2D and 3D convolution fail to fully exploit the spatio-temporal nature of videos. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid video diffusion model, called HVDM, which can capture spatio-temporal dependencies more effectively. The HVDM is trained by a hybrid video autoencoder which extracts a disentangled representation of the video including: (i) a global context information captured by a 2D projected latent (ii) a local volume information captured by 3D convolutions with wavelet decomposition (iii) a frequency information for improving the video reconstruction. Based on this disentangled representation, our hybrid autoencoder provide a more comprehensive video latent enriching the generated videos with fine structures and details. Experiments on video generation benchamarks (UCF101, SkyTimelapse, and TaiChi) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality, showing a wide range of video applications (e.g., long video generation, image-to-video, and video dynamics control).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bi'an Du, Xiang Gao, Wei Hu, Renjie Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative 3D part assembly involves understanding part relationships and predicting their 6-DoF poses for assembling a realistic 3D shape. Prior work often focus on the geometry of individual parts, neglecting part-whole hierarchies of objects. Leveraging two key observations: 1) super-part poses provide strong hints about part poses, and 2) predicting super-part poses is easier due to fewer superparts, we propose a part-whole-hierarchy message passing network for efficient 3D part assembly. We first introduce super-parts by grouping geometrically similar parts without any semantic labels. Then we employ a part-whole hierarchical encoder, wherein a super-part encoder predicts latent super-part poses based on input parts. Subsequently, we transform the point cloud using the latent poses, feeding it to the part encoder for aggregating super-part information and reasoning about part relationships to predict all part poses. In training, only ground-truth part poses are required. During inference, the predicted latent poses of super-parts enhance interpretability. Experimental results on the PartNet dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in part and connectivity accuracy and enables an interpretable hierarchical part assembly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongliang Cao, Marvin Eisenberger, Nafie El Amrani, Daniel Cremers, Florian Bernard</p>
<p>Abstract: Although 3D shape matching and interpolation are highly interrelated, they are often studied separately and applied sequentially to relate different 3D shapes, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end, we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand, by incorporating spatial maps, our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand, by introducing spectral maps, our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore, we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation, even compared to supervised approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has been facilitated by advancements in model algorithms, the increasing scale of foundation models, and the availability of ample high-quality datasets. While AIGC has achieved remarkable performance, it still faces several challenges, such as the difficulty of maintaining up-to-date and long-tail knowledge, the risk of data leakage, and the high costs associated with training and inference. Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for future research.Project Repo: https://github.com/hymie122/RAG-Survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interest is increasing among political scientists in leveraging the extensive information available in images. However, the challenge of interpreting these images lies in the need for specialized knowledge in computer vision and access to specialized hardware. As a result, image analysis has been limited to a relatively small group within the political science community. This landscape could potentially change thanks to the rise of large language models (LLMs). This paper aims to raise awareness of the feasibility of using Gemini for image content analysis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a corpus of 688 images. Content reports were elicited from Gemini for each image and then manually evaluated by the authors. We find that Gemini is highly accurate in performing object detection, which is arguably the most common and fundamental task in image analysis for political scientists. Equally important, we show that it is easy to implement as the entire command consists of a single prompt in natural language; it is fast to run and should meet the time budget of most researchers; and it is free to use and does not require any specialized hardware. In addition, we illustrate how political scientists can leverage Gemini for other image understanding tasks, including face identification, sentiment analysis, and caption generation. Our findings suggest that Gemini and other similar LLMs have the potential to drastically stimulate and accelerate image research in political science and social sciences more broadly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Street View-level Imagery (SVI) is a valuable data source for studies (e.g., environmental assessments, green space identification or land cover classification). While commercial SVI is available, such providers commonly restrict copying or reuse in ways necessary for research. Open SVI datasets are readily available from less restrictive sources, such as Mapillary, but due to the heterogeneity of the images, these require substantial preprocessing, filtering, and careful quality checks. We present an efficient method for automated downloading, processing, cropping, and filtering open SVI, to be used in a survey of human perceptions of the streets portrayed in these images. We demonstrate our open-source reusable SVI preparation and smartphone-friendly perception-survey software with Amsterdam (Netherlands) as the case study. Using a citizen science approach, we collected from 331 people 22,637 ratings about their perceptions for various criteria. We have published our software in a public repository for future re-use and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Jing, Tan Yujuan, Ren Ao, Liu Duo</p>
<p>Abstract: The prediction of optical flow for occluded points is still a difficult problem that has not yet been solved. Recent methods use self-attention to find relevant non-occluded points as references for estimating the optical flow of occluded points based on the assumption of self-similarity. However, they rely on visual features of a single image and weak constraints, which are not sufficient to constrain the trained network to focus on erroneous and weakly relevant reference points. We make full use of online occlusion recognition information to construct occlusion extended visual features and two strong constraints, allowing the network to learn to focus only on the most relevant references without requiring occlusion ground truth to participate in the training of the network. Our method adds very few network parameters to the original framework, making it very lightweight. Extensive experiments show that our model has the greatest cross-dataset generalization. Our method achieves much greater error reduction, 18.6%, 16.2%, and 20.1% for all points, non-occluded points, and occluded points respectively from the state-of-the-art GMA-base method, MATCHFlow(GMA), on Sintel Albedo pass. Furthermore, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Sintel bench-marks, ranking \#1 among all published methods on Sintel clean pass. The code will be open-source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongqi Yue, Pan Zhou, Richang Hong, Hanwang Zhang, Qianru Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Even when using large multi-modal foundation models, few-shot learning is still challenging -- if there is no proper inductive bias, it is nearly impossible to keep the nuanced class attributes while removing the visually prominent attributes that spuriously correlate with class labels. To this end, we find an inductive bias that the time-steps of a Diffusion Model (DM) can isolate the nuanced class attributes, i.e., as the forward diffusion adds noise to an image at each time-step, nuanced attributes are usually lost at an earlier time-step than the spurious attributes that are visually prominent. Building on this, we propose Time-step Few-shot (TiF) learner. We train class-specific low-rank adapters for a text-conditioned DM to make up for the lost attributes, such that images can be accurately reconstructed from their noisy ones given a prompt. Hence, at a small time-step, the adapter and prompt are essentially a parameterization of only the nuanced class attributes. For a test image, we can use the parameterization to only extract the nuanced class attributes for classification. TiF learner significantly outperforms OpenCLIP and its adapters on a variety of fine-grained and customized few-shot learning tasks. Codes are in https://github.com/yue-zhongqi/tif.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Liu, Hongzi Zhu, Zhenxi Wang, Yunsong Zhou, Shan Chang, Minyi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Registration of point clouds collected from a pair of distant vehicles provides a comprehensive and accurate 3D view of the driving scenario, which is vital for driving safety related applications, yet existing literature suffers from the expensive pose label acquisition and the deficiency to generalize to new data distributions. In this paper, we propose EYOC, an unsupervised distant point cloud registration method that adapts to new point cloud distributions on the fly, requiring no global pose labels. The core idea of EYOC is to train a feature extractor in a progressive fashion, where in each round, the feature extractor, trained with near point cloud pairs, can label slightly farther point cloud pairs, enabling self-supervision on such far point cloud pairs. This process continues until the derived extractor can be used to register distant point clouds. Particularly, to enable high-fidelity correspondence label generation, we devise an effective spatial filtering scheme to select the most representative correspondences to register a point cloud pair, and then utilize the aligned point clouds to discover more correct correspondences. Experiments show that EYOC can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods at a lower training cost. Moreover, it outwits supervised methods regarding generalization performance on new data distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretable computer vision models can produce transparent predictions, where the features of an image are compared with prototypes from a training dataset and the similarity between them forms a basis for classification. Nevertheless these methods are computationally expensive to train, introduce additional complexity and may require domain knowledge to adapt hyper-parameters to a new dataset. Inspired by developments in object detection, segmentation and large-scale self-supervised foundation vision models, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel explainable-by-design image classification approach using a transformer-decoder head and hierarchical mixture-modelling. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent image components, such as the head, body, wings and tail of a bird, and the image background, and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction. We demonstrate that ComFe obtains higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. We also show that ComFe outperforms a non-interpretable linear head across a range of datasets, including ImageNet, and improves performance on generalisation and robustness benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Xu, Zezheng Zhao, Yuxin Cao, Chunyu Chen, Hao Ge, Ziyao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D face reconstruction plays a crucial role in avatar generation, with significant demand in web-related applications such as generating virtual financial advisors in FinTech. Current reconstruction methods predominantly rely on deep learning techniques and employ 2D self-supervision as a means to guide model learning. However, these methods encounter challenges in capturing the comprehensive 3D structural information of the face due to the utilization of 2D images for model training purposes. To overcome this limitation and enhance the reconstruction of 3D structural features, we propose an innovative approach that integrates existing 2D features with 3D features to guide the model learning process. Specifically, we introduce the 3D-ID Loss, which leverages the high-dimensional structure features extracted from a Spectral-Based Graph Convolution Encoder applied to the facial mesh. This approach surpasses the sole reliance on the 3D information provided by the facial mesh vertices coordinates. Our model is trained using 2D-3D data pairs from a combination of datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NoW benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Fan Zhang, Weichen Yu, Qingsong Wen, Xue Wang, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual descriptions based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated content, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward vision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we propose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the output distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores for each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias sampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods. Furthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and raising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzu Wu, Xianfeng Wu, Tianyu Luan, Yajing Bai, Zhongyuan Lai, Junsong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: While previous studies have demonstrated successful 3D object shape completion with a sufficient number of points, they often fail in scenarios when a few points, e.g. tens of points, are observed. Surprisingly, via entropy analysis, we find that even a few points, e.g. 64 points, could retain substantial information to help recover the 3D shape of the object. To address the challenge of shape completion with very sparse point clouds, we then propose Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model, which contains a novel dual-branch feature extractor for handling extremely sparse inputs, coupled with an extensive branch for maximal point utilization with a saliency branch for dynamic importance assignment. This model is further bolstered by a two-stage revision network that refines both the extracted features and the decoder output, enhancing the detail and authenticity of the completed point cloud. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering 3D shapes from a few points. The proposed Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model outperforms previous methods on both few-point inputs and many-point inputs, and shows good generalizability to different object categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunlong Xia, Xinliang Wang, Feng Lv, Xin Hao, Yifeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved significant success in computer vision, it does not perform well in dense prediction tasks due to the lack of inner-patch information interaction and the limited diversity of feature scale. Most existing studies are devoted to designing vision-specific transformers to solve the above problems, which introduce additional pre-training costs. Therefore, we present a plain, pre-training-free, and feature-enhanced ViT backbone with Convolutional Multi-scale feature interaction, named ViT-CoMer, which facilitates bidirectional interaction between CNN and transformer. Compared to the state-of-the-art, ViT-CoMer has the following advantages: (1) We inject spatial pyramid multi-receptive field convolutional features into the ViT architecture, which effectively alleviates the problems of limited local information interaction and single-feature representation in ViT. (2) We propose a simple and efficient CNN-Transformer bidirectional fusion interaction module that performs multi-scale fusion across hierarchical features, which is beneficial for handling dense prediction tasks. (3) We evaluate the performance of ViT-CoMer across various dense prediction tasks, different frameworks, and multiple advanced pre-training. Notably, our ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO val2017 without extra training data, and 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K val, both of which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We hope ViT-CoMer can serve as a new backbone for dense prediction tasks to facilitate future research. The code will be released at https://github.com/Traffic-X/ViT-CoMer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vu Minh Hieu Phan, Yutong Xie, Yuankai Qi, Lingqiao Liu, Liyang Liu, Bowen Zhang, Zhibin Liao, Qi Wu, Minh-Son To, Johan W. Verjans</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical vision language pre-training (VLP) has emerged as a frontier of research, enabling zero-shot pathological recognition by comparing the query image with the textual descriptions for each disease. Due to the complex semantics of biomedical texts, current methods struggle to align medical images with key pathological findings in unstructured reports. This leads to the misalignment with the target disease's textual representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions into their fundamental aspects, leveraging prior knowledge about the visual manifestations of pathologies. This is achieved by consulting a large language model and medical experts. Integrating a Transformer module, our approach aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease, generating aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each aspect, we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated disease. Additionally, capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations, we present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases, optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy. Conducting experiments on seven downstream datasets, ours improves the accuracy of recent methods by up to 8.56% and 17.0% for seen and unseen categories, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Oshima, Shohei Taniguchi, Masahiro Suzuki, Yutaka Matsuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the remarkable achievements in image generation through diffusion models, the research community has shown increasing interest in extending these models to video generation. Recent diffusion models for video generation have predominantly utilized attention layers to extract temporal features. However, attention layers are limited by their memory consumption, which increases quadratically with the length of the sequence. This limitation presents significant challenges when attempting to generate longer video sequences using diffusion models. To overcome this challenge, we propose leveraging state-space models (SSMs). SSMs have recently gained attention as viable alternatives due to their linear memory consumption relative to sequence length. In the experiments, we first evaluate our SSM-based model with UCF101, a standard benchmark of video generation. In addition, to investigate the potential of SSMs for longer video generation, we perform an experiment using the MineRL Navigate dataset, varying the number of frames to 64, 200, and 400. In these settings, our SSM-based model can considerably save memory consumption for longer sequences, while maintaining competitive FVD scores to the attention-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Tran, Di Chang, Maksim Siniukov, Mohammad Soleymani</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-human communication is like a delicate dance where listeners and speakers concurrently interact to maintain conversational dynamics. Hence, an effective model for generating listener nonverbal behaviors requires understanding the dyadic context and interaction. In this paper, we present an effective framework for creating 3D facial motions in dyadic interactions. Existing work consider a listener as a reactive agent with reflexive behaviors to the speaker's voice and facial motions. The heart of our framework is Dyadic Interaction Modeling (DIM), a pre-training approach that jointly models speakers' and listeners' motions through masking and contrastive learning to learn representations that capture the dyadic context. To enable the generation of non-deterministic behaviors, we encode both listener and speaker motions into discrete latent representations, through VQ-VAE. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in generating listener motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art according to the quantitative measures capturing the diversity and realism of generated motions. Qualitative results demonstrate the superior capabilities of the proposed approach in generating diverse and realistic expressions, eye blinks and head gestures.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is evident that, currently, generative models are surpassed in quality by human professionals. However, with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence, this gap will narrow, leading to scenarios where individuals who have dedicated years of their lives to mastering a skill become obsolete due to their high costs, which are inherently linked to the time they require to complete a task -- a task that AI could accomplish in minutes or seconds. To avoid future social upheavals, we must, even now, contemplate how to fairly assess the contributions of such individuals in training generative models and how to compensate them for the reduction or complete loss of their incomes. In this work, we propose a method to structure collaboration between model developers and data providers. To achieve this, we employ Shapley Values to quantify the contribution of artist(s) in an image generated by the Stable Diffusion-v1.5 model and to equitably allocate the reward among them.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10030">Multi-criteria Token Fusion with One-step-ahead Attention for Efficient Vision Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyeok Lee, Joonmyung Choi, Hyunwoo J. Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent backbone for computer vision. For more efficient ViTs, recent works lessen the quadratic cost of the self-attention layer by pruning or fusing the redundant tokens. However, these works faced the speed-accuracy trade-off caused by the loss of information. Here, we argue that token fusion needs to consider diverse relations between tokens to minimize information loss. In this paper, we propose a Multi-criteria Token Fusion (MCTF), that gradually fuses the tokens based on multi-criteria (e.g., similarity, informativeness, and size of fused tokens). Further, we utilize the one-step-ahead attention, which is the improved approach to capture the informativeness of the tokens. By training the model equipped with MCTF using a token reduction consistency, we achieve the best speed-accuracy trade-off in the image classification (ImageNet1K). Experimental results prove that MCTF consistently surpasses the previous reduction methods with and without training. Specifically, DeiT-T and DeiT-S with MCTF reduce FLOPs by about 44% while improving the performance (+0.5%, and +0.3%) over the base model, respectively. We also demonstrate the applicability of MCTF in various Vision Transformers (e.g., T2T-ViT, LV-ViT), achieving at least 31% speedup without performance degradation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Shan, Yujie Zhang, Qi Yang, Haichen Yang, Yiling Xu, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Xiaozhong Xu, Shan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available reference, which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization of deep neural networks. However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of generalization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain anchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and distortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks. Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing learning-based PCQA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradeep Chakraborty, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Our paper introduces a novel two-stage self-supervised approach for detecting co-occurring salient objects (CoSOD) in image groups without requiring segmentation annotations. Unlike existing unsupervised methods that rely solely on patch-level information (e.g. clustering patch descriptors) or on computation heavy off-the-shelf components for CoSOD, our lightweight model leverages feature correspondences at both patch and region levels, significantly improving prediction performance. In the first stage, we train a self-supervised network that detects co-salient regions by computing local patch-level feature correspondences across images. We obtain the segmentation predictions using confidence-based adaptive thresholding. In the next stage, we refine these intermediate segmentations by eliminating the detected regions (within each image) whose averaged feature representations are dissimilar to the foreground feature representation averaged across all the cross-attention maps (from the previous stage). Extensive experiments on three CoSOD benchmark datasets show that our self-supervised model outperforms the corresponding state-of-the-art models by a huge margin (e.g. on the CoCA dataset, our model has a 13.7% F-measure gain over the SOTA unsupervised CoSOD model). Notably, our self-supervised model also outperforms several recent fully supervised CoSOD models on the three test datasets (e.g., on the CoCA dataset, our model has a 4.6% F-measure gain over a recent supervised CoSOD model).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Cao, Jinghao Li, Xi Xiao, Derui Wang, Minhui Xue, Hao Ge, Wei Liu, Guangwu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work has shown that well-crafted adversarial perturbations can threaten the security of video recognition systems. Attackers can invade such models with a low query budget when the perturbations are semantic-invariant, such as StyleFool. Despite the query efficiency, the naturalness of the minutia areas still requires amelioration, since StyleFool leverages style transfer to all pixels in each frame. To close the gap, we propose LocalStyleFool, an improved black-box video adversarial attack that superimposes regional style-transfer-based perturbations on videos. Benefiting from the popularity and scalably usability of Segment Anything Model (SAM), we first extract different regions according to semantic information and then track them through the video stream to maintain the temporal consistency. Then, we add style-transfer-based perturbations to several regions selected based on the associative criterion of transfer-based gradient information and regional area. Perturbation fine adjustment is followed to make stylized videos adversarial. We demonstrate that LocalStyleFool can improve both intra-frame and inter-frame naturalness through a human-assessed survey, while maintaining competitive fooling rate and query efficiency. Successful experiments on the high-resolution dataset also showcase that scrupulous segmentation of SAM helps to improve the scalability of adversarial attacks under high-resolution data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vehicle trajectory prediction has increasingly relied on data-driven solutions, but their ability to scale to different data domains and the impact of larger dataset sizes on their generalization remain under-explored. While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset.

GLIP builds on Fast Language-Image Pre-Training (FLIP), which randomly masks image patches while training a CLIP model. GLIP replaces random masking with centered masking, that uses a Gaussian distribution and is inspired by the importance of image patches at the center of the image. GLIP retains the same computational savings as FLIP, while improving performance across a range of downstream datasets and tasks, as demonstrated by our experimental results. We show the benefits of GLIP to be easy to obtain, requiring no delicate tuning of the Gaussian, and also applicable to data sets containing images without an obvious center focus.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the emergence of foundation models, deep learning-based object detectors have shown practical usability in closed set scenarios. However, for real-world tasks, object detectors often operate in open environments, where crucial factors (e.g., data distribution, objective) that influence model learning are often changing. The dynamic and intricate nature of the open environment poses novel and formidable challenges to object detectors. Unfortunately, current research on object detectors in open environments lacks a comprehensive analysis of their distinctive characteristics, challenges, and corresponding solutions, which hinders their secure deployment in critical real-world scenarios. This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive review and analysis of object detectors in open environments. We initially identified limitations of key structural components within the existing detection pipeline and propose the open environment object detector challenge framework that includes four quadrants (i.e., out-of-domain, out-of-category, robust learning, and incremental learning) based on the dimensions of the data / target changes. For each quadrant of challenges in the proposed framework, we present a detailed description and systematic analysis of the overarching goals and core difficulties, systematically review the corresponding solutions, and benchmark their performance over multiple widely adopted datasets. In addition, we engage in a discussion of open problems and potential avenues for future research. This paper aims to provide a fresh, comprehensive, and systematic understanding of the challenges and solutions associated with open-environment object detectors, thus catalyzing the development of more solid applications in real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Zheng, Chenhao Lin, Jiahao Sun, Zhengyu Zhao, Qian Li, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based monocular depth estimation (MDE), extensively applied in autonomous driving, is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous physical attacks against MDE models rely on 2D adversarial patches, so they only affect a small, localized region in the MDE map but fail under various viewpoints. To address these limitations, we propose 3D Depth Fool (3D$^2$Fool), the first 3D texture-based adversarial attack against MDE models. 3D$^2$Fool is specifically optimized to generate 3D adversarial textures agnostic to model types of vehicles and to have improved robustness in bad weather conditions, such as rain and fog. Experimental results validate the superior performance of our 3D$^2$Fool across various scenarios, including vehicles, MDE models, weather conditions, and viewpoints. Real-world experiments with printed 3D textures on physical vehicle models further demonstrate that our 3D$^2$Fool can cause an MDE error of over 10 meters.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we uncover the unexpected efficacy of residual-based large language models (LLMs) as part of encoders for biomedical imaging tasks, a domain traditionally devoid of language or textual data. The approach diverges from established methodologies by utilizing a frozen transformer block, extracted from pre-trained LLMs, as an innovative encoder layer for the direct processing of visual tokens. This strategy represents a significant departure from the standard multi-modal vision-language frameworks, which typically hinge on language-driven prompts and inputs. We found that these LLMs could boost performance across a spectrum of biomedical imaging applications, including both 2D and 3D visual classification tasks, serving as plug-and-play boosters. More interestingly, as a byproduct, we found that the proposed framework achieved superior performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on extensive, standardized datasets in MedMNIST-2D and 3D. Through this work, we aim to open new avenues for employing LLMs in biomedical imaging and enriching the understanding of their potential in this specialized domain.</p>

However, mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their unexplainable nature, often identified indirectly through visualization or sample statistics, which necessitates additional human supervision for interpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T) framework, which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically, we extract common keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential biases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their similarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model. The keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages, such as a clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing using these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify known biases, such as gender bias in CelebA, background bias in Waterbirds, and distribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally, B2T uncovers novel biases in larger datasets, such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example, we discovered a contextual bias between "bee" and "flower" in ImageNet. We also highlight various applications of B2T keywords, including debiased training, CLIP prompting, and model comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yu, Danruo Deng, Furui Liu, Yueming Jin, Qi Dou, Guangyong Chen, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods assume that labeled data, unlabeled data and test data are from the same distribution. Open-set semi-supervised learning (Open-set SSL) considers a more practical scenario, where unlabeled data and test data contain new categories (outliers) not observed in labeled data (inliers). Most previous works focused on outlier detection via binary classifiers, which suffer from insufficient scalability and inability to distinguish different types of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Negative Evidential Deep Learning (ANEDL) to tackle these limitations. Concretely, we first introduce evidential deep learning (EDL) as an outlier detector to quantify different types of uncertainty, and design different uncertainty metrics for self-training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive negative optimization strategy, making EDL more tailored to the unlabeled dataset containing both inliers and outliers. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across four datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Kuniaki Saito, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Kate Saenko, Bryan A. Plummer</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) measures a classifier's ability to generalize to new distributions of data it was not trained on. Recent work has shown that a hyperparameter-tuned Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training procedure, that is simply minimizing the empirical risk on the source domains, can outperform most existing DG methods. ERM has achieved such strong results while only tuning hyper-parameters such as learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and dropout. However there are additional hyperparameters which further limit overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We therefore focus on tuning previously untuned hyper-parameters, including training amount, initialization, and additional regularizers. We call the resulting stronger baseline ERM++. ERM++ improves the performance of DG by over 5% compared to prior ERM baselines on a standard benchmark of 5 datasets with a ResNet-50 and over 15% with a ViT-B/16, and outperforms all SOTA methods on DomainBed with both architectures. We also explore the relationship between DG performance and similarity to pre-training data, and find that similarity to pre-training data distributions is an important driver of performance, but that ERM++ with stronger initializations can deliver strong performance even on dissimilar datasets.Code is released at https://github.com/piotr-teterwak/erm_plusplus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabri Mustafa Kahya, Muhammet Sami Yavuz, Eckehard Steinbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting human presence indoors with millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar faces challenges from both moving and stationary clutter. This work proposes a robust and real-time capable human presence and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method using 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar. HOOD solves the human presence and OOD detection problems simultaneously in a single pipeline. Our solution relies on a reconstruction-based architecture and works with radar macro and micro range-Doppler images (RDIs). HOOD aims to accurately detect the presence of humans in the presence or absence of moving and stationary disturbers. Since HOOD is also an OOD detector, it aims to detect moving or stationary clutters as OOD in humans' absence and predicts the current scene's output as "no presence." HOOD performs well in diverse scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness across different human activities and situations. On our dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar, we achieve an average AUROC of 94.36%. Additionally, our extensive evaluations and experiments demonstrate that HOOD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection methods in terms of common OOD detection metrics. Importantly, HOOD also perfectly fits on Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, which showcases its versatility across different hardware environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheekar Banerjee, Md. Kamrul Hasan Monir</p>
<p>Abstract: Undoubtedly breast cancer identifies itself as one of the most widespread and terrifying cancers across the globe. Millions of women are getting affected each year from it. Breast cancer remains the major one for being the reason of largest number of demise of women. In the recent time of research, Medical Image Computing and Processing has been playing a significant role for detecting and classifying breast cancers from ultrasound images and mammograms, along with the celestial touch of deep neural networks. In this research, we focused mostly on our rigorous implementations and iterative result analysis of different cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely EfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image, named as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the pre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. We activated the hyper-parameter tuning procedures, added fully connected layers, discarded the unprecedented outliers and recorded the accuracy results from our custom modified EfficientNet architectures. Our deep learning model training approach was related to both identifying the cancer affected areas with region of interest (ROI) techniques and multiple classifications (benign, malignant and normal). The approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of EfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%, b5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1- 99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong potentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and classification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early stage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Galati, Daniele Falcetta, Rosa Cortese, Barbara Casolla, Ferran Prados, Ninon Burgos, Maria A. Zuluaga</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for brain vessel segmentation from different image modalities. Existing state-of-the-art methods focus on a single modality, despite the wide range of available cerebrovascular imaging techniques. This can lead to significant distribution shifts that negatively impact the generalization across modalities. By relying on annotated angiographies and a limited number of annotated venographies, our framework accomplishes image-to-image translation and semantic segmentation, leveraging a disentangled and semantically rich latent space to represent heterogeneous data and perform image-level adaptation from source to target domains. Moreover, we reduce the typical complexity of cycle-based architectures and minimize the use of adversarial training, which allows us to build an efficient and intuitive model with stable training. We evaluate our method on magnetic resonance angiographies and venographies. While achieving state-of-the-art performance in the source domain, our method attains a Dice score coefficient in the target domain that is only 8.9% lower, highlighting its promising potential for robust cerebrovascular image segmentation across different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilue Qian, Peiyu Yu, Ying Nian Wu, Yao Su, Wei Wang, Lifeng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual planning simulates how humans make decisions to achieve desired goals in the form of searching for visual causal transitions between an initial visual state and a final visual goal state. It has become increasingly important in egocentric vision with its advantages in guiding agents to perform daily tasks in complex environments. In this paper, we propose an interpretable and generalizable visual planning framework consisting of i) a novel Substitution-based Concept Learner (SCL) that abstracts visual inputs into disentangled concept representations, ii) symbol abstraction and reasoning that performs task planning via the self-learned symbols, and iii) a Visual Causal Transition model (ViCT) that grounds visual causal transitions to semantically similar real-world actions. Given an initial state, we perform goal-conditioned visual planning with a symbolic reasoning method fueled by the learned representations and causal transitions to reach the goal state. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a large-scale visual planning dataset based on AI2-THOR, dubbed as CCTP. Extensive experiments on this challenging dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method in visual task planning. Empirically, we show that our framework can generalize to unseen task trajectories, unseen object categories, and real-world data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cathrin Elich, Lukas Kirchdorfer, Jan M. K\"ohler, Lukas Schott</p>
<p>Abstract: While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL) baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we challenge paradigms in MTL in the context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only been mildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such as the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To further investigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scale invariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has often been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of gradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment we find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize differences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Lastly, we compare the transferability of features learned through MTL and STL on common image corruptions, and find light evidence that MTL can lead to superior transferability. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yuan, Chuan Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning selects the most informative samples from the unlabelled dataset to annotate in the context of a limited annotation budget. While numerous methods have been proposed for subsequent sample selection based on an initialized model, scant attention has been paid to the indispensable phase of active learning: selecting samples for model cold-start initialization. Most of the previous studies resort to random sampling or naive clustering. However, random sampling is prone to fluctuation, and naive clustering suffers from convergence speed, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data such as imaging data. In this work, we propose to integrate foundation models with clustering methods to select samples for cold-start active learning initialization. Foundation models refer to those trained on massive datasets by the self-supervised paradigm and capable of generating informative and compacted embeddings for various downstream tasks. Leveraging these embeddings to replace raw features such as pixel values, clustering quickly converges and identifies better initial samples. For a comprehensive comparison, we included a classic ImageNet-supervised model to acquire embeddings. Experiments on two clinical tasks of image classification and segmentation demonstrated that foundation model-based clustering efficiently pinpointed informative initial samples, leading to models showcasing enhanced performance than the baseline methods. We envisage that this study provides an effective paradigm for future cold-start active learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Soo Min Kwon, Ismail R. Alkhouri, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasamin Medghalchi, Niloufar Zakariaei, Arman Rahmim, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the abundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive, particularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with their duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various scenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when dealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different devices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new informative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based on natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant GPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we introduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method tailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective fine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\% of parameters compared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset diversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process prompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across different images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making processes regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial role than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms classifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior performance when encountering unseen datasets.

<p>Abstract: Prior study shows that pre-training techniques can boost the performance of visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g., locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme, facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information extraction, document classification, and document question answering.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of mobile manipulation using legged robots equipped with an arm, namely legged loco-manipulation. The robot legs, while usually utilized for mobility, offer an opportunity to amplify the manipulation capabilities by conducting whole-body control. That is, the robot can control the legs and the arm at the same time to extend its workspace. We propose a framework that can conduct the whole-body control autonomously with visual observations. Our approach, namely Visual Whole-Body Control(VBC), is composed of a low-level policy using all degrees of freedom to track the end-effector manipulator position and a high-level policy proposing the end-effector position based on visual inputs. We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer for real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments and show significant improvements over baselines in picking up diverse objects in different configurations (heights, locations, orientations) and environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Chao Tang, Amir Aghabiglou, Chung San Chu, Yves Wiaux</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</p>
