<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Blair-Stanek, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: An LLM is stable if it reaches the same conclusion when asked the identical question multiple times. We find leading LLMs like gpt-4o, claude-3.5, and gemini-1.5 are unstable when providing answers to hard legal questions, even when made as deterministic as possible by setting temperature to 0. We curate and release a novel dataset of 500 legal questions distilled from real cases, involving two parties, with facts, competing legal arguments, and the question of which party should prevail. When provided the exact same question, we observe that LLMs sometimes say one party should win, while other times saying the other party should win. This instability has implications for the increasing numbers of legal AI products, legal processes, and lawyers relying on these LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05202">Accelerating LLM Inference with Lossless Speculative Decoding Algorithms for Heterogeneous Vocabularies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Oren Pereg, Gaurav Jain, Roy Schwartz, Moshe Wasserblat, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms achieve significant speedups over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05233">Efficient Knowledge Feeding to Language Models: A Novel Integrated Encoder-Decoder Architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> S Santosh Kumar, Rishi Gottimukkala, Supriya Devidutta, Karthikeyan S</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently feeding knowledge to language models (LLMs) during prediction by integrating retrieval and generation processes within a unified framework. While the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model addresses gaps in LLMs' training data and knowledge limits, it is hindered by token limit restrictions and dependency on the retrieval system's accuracy. Our proposed architecture incorporates in-context vectors (ICV) to overcome these challenges. ICV recasts in-context learning by using latent embeddings of LLMs to create a vector that captures essential task information. This vector is then used to shift the latent states of the LLM, enhancing the generation process without adding demonstration examples to the prompt. ICV directly integrates information into the model, enabling it to process this information more effectively. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ICV outperforms standard in-context learning and fine-tuning across question-answering, information retrieval, and other tasks. This approach mitigates the limitations of current RAG models and offers a more robust solution for handling extensive and diverse datasets. Despite leveraging a fraction of the parameters, our ICV-enhanced model achieves competitive performance against models like LLaMA-3, Gemma, and Phi-3, significantly reducing computational costs and memory requirements. ICV reduces prompt length, is easy to control, surpasses token limitations, and is computationally efficient compared to fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussam Ghanem (ICB, UB), Christophe Cruz (ICB, UB)</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated significant potential in the automated construction of knowledge graphs from unstructured text. This paper builds upon our previous work [16], which evaluated various models using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, triple matching, and graph matching, and introduces a refined approach to address the critical issues of hallucination and omission. We propose an enhanced evaluation framework incorporating BERTScore for graph similarity, setting a practical threshold of 95% for graph matching. Our experiments focus on the Mistral model, comparing its original and fine-tuned versions in zero-shot and few-shot settings. We further extend our experiments using examples from the KELM-sub training dataset, illustrating that the fine-tuned model significantly improves knowledge graph construction accuracy while reducing the exact hallucination and omission. However, our findings also reveal that the fine-tuned models perform worse in generalization tasks on the KELM-sub dataset. This study underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluation metrics in advancing the state-of-the-art in knowledge graph construction from textual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxu Chen, Dongrui Liu, Tao Luo, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining the hidden representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a perspective to understand LLMs' underlying inference logic and improve their reliability in application scenarios. However, previous methods introduce external ''black-box'' modules to explain ''black-box'' LLMs, increasing the potential uncertainty and failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining method SEER, enhancing LLMs' explainability by aggregating the same concept and disentangling the different concepts in the representation space. In this way, SEER provides faithful explanations carried by representations synchronously with the LLMs' output. Additionally, we showcase the applications of SEER on trustworthiness-related tasks (e.g., the safety risks classification and detoxification tasks), where self-explained LLMs achieve consistent improvement in explainability and performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of SEER on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Bhandari, Usman Naseem, Amitava Datta, Nicolas Fay, Mehwish Nasim</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychological assessment tools have long helped humans understand behavioural patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content comparable to that of humans, we explore whether they exhibit personality traits. To this end, this work applies psychological tools to LLMs in diverse scenarios to generate personality profiles. Using established trait-based questionnaires such as the Big Five Inventory and by addressing the possibility of training data contamination, we examine the dimensional variability and dominance of LLMs across five core personality dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit unique dominant traits, varying characteristics, and distinct personality profiles even within the same family of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Hongyi Liu, Zhuoming Chen, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in information retrieval and long-document QA. However, to tackle the most challenging intellectual problems, LLMs must reason effectively in long and complex contexts (e.g., frontier mathematical research). Studying how LLMs handle increasing reasoning complexity and context length is essential, yet existing benchmarks lack a solid basis for quantitative evaluation. Inspired by the abstraction of GSM-8K problems as computational graphs, and the ability to introduce noise by adding unnecessary nodes and edges, we develop a grade school math problem generator capable of producing arithmetic problems with infinite difficulty and context length under fine-grained control. Using our newly synthesized GSM-Infinite benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate existing LLMs. We find a consistent sigmoid decline in reasoning performance as complexity increases, along with a systematic inference scaling trend: exponentially increasing inference computation yields only linear performance gains. These findings underscore the fundamental limitations of current long-context LLMs and the key challenges in scaling reasoning capabilities. Our GSM-Infinite benchmark provides a scalable and controllable testbed for systematically studying and advancing LLM reasoning in long and complex contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an outcome-driven fine-tuning framework that enhances the forecasting capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without relying on human-curated reasoning samples. Our method leverages model self-play to generate pairs of diverse reasoning trajectories and probabilistic forecasts for a set of diverse questions that resolve after the models' knowledge cutoff date. We then rank pairs of these reasoning traces by their distance to the actual outcomes before fine-tuning the model via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). On a separate test set, our approach increases prediction accuracy of Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B by between 7--10\% over a base model and a DPO fine-tuned control model with randomized labels, bringing them on par with forecasting capabilities of much larger frontier models like GPT-4o.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Vipul Gupta, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Rebecca J. Passonneau</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05312">Towards the Development of Balanced Synthetic Data for Correcting Grammatical Errors in Arabic: An Approach Based on Error Tagging Model and Synthetic Data Generating Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahlam Alrehili, Areej Alhothali</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation is widely recognized as a way to enhance the quality of neural grammatical error correction (GEC) systems. However, current approaches often lack diversity or are too simplistic to generate the wide range of grammatical errors made by humans, especially for low-resource languages such as Arabic. In this paper, we will develop the error tagging model and the synthetic data generation model to create a large synthetic dataset in Arabic for grammatical error correction. In the error tagging model, the correct sentence is categorized into multiple error types by using the DeBERTav3 model. Arabic Error Type Annotation tool (ARETA) is used to guide multi-label classification tasks in an error tagging model in which each sentence is classified into 26 error tags. The synthetic data generation model is a back-translation-based model that generates incorrect sentences by appending error tags before the correct sentence that was generated from the error tagging model using the ARAT5 model. In the QALB-14 and QALB-15 Test sets, the error tagging model achieved 94.42% F1, which is state-of-the-art in identifying error tags in clean sentences. As a result of our syntactic data training in grammatical error correction, we achieved a new state-of-the-art result of F1-Score: 79.36% in the QALB-14 Test set. We generate 30,219,310 synthetic sentence pairs by using a synthetic data generation model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05331">Fine-Tuned LLMs are &quot;Time Capsules&quot; for Tracking Societal Bias Through Books</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmitra Madhusudan, Robert Morabito, Skye Reid, Nikta Gohari Sadr, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: Books, while often rich in cultural insights, can also mirror societal biases of their eras - biases that Large Language Models (LLMs) may learn and perpetuate during training. We introduce a novel method to trace and quantify these biases using fine-tuned LLMs. We develop BookPAGE, a corpus comprising 593 fictional books across seven decades (1950-2019), to track bias evolution. By fine-tuning LLMs on books from each decade and using targeted prompts, we examine shifts in biases related to gender, sexual orientation, race, and religion. Our findings indicate that LLMs trained on decade-specific books manifest biases reflective of their times, with both gradual trends and notable shifts. For example, model responses showed a progressive increase in the portrayal of women in leadership roles (from 8% to 22%) from the 1950s to 2010s, with a significant uptick in the 1990s (from 4% to 12%), possibly aligning with third-wave feminism. Same-sex relationship references increased markedly from the 1980s to 2000s (from 0% to 10%), mirroring growing LGBTQ+ visibility. Concerningly, negative portrayals of Islam rose sharply in the 2000s (26% to 38%), likely reflecting post-9/11 sentiments. Importantly, we demonstrate that these biases stem mainly from the books' content and not the models' architecture or initial training. Our study offers a new perspective on societal bias trends by bridging AI, literary studies, and social science research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05346">Probabilistic Subspace Manifolds for Contextual Inference in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Nightingale, Dominic Lavington, Jonathan Thistlethwaite, Sebastian Penhaligon, Thomas Belinski, David Boldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing token embeddings as probability distributions over learned manifolds allows for more flexible contextual inference, reducing representational rigidity while enhancing semantic granularity. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that probabilistic embeddings improve neighborhood consistency and decrease redundancy, ensuring that token relationships remain more structurally coherent across fine-tuning iterations. The integration of probabilistic subspaces within attention mechanisms facilitates more adaptive contextual weighting, enabling models to capture latent dependencies that would otherwise be obscured in conventional embeddings. Experimental results highlight increased robustness against adversarial modifications, with probabilistic embeddings preserving contextual integrity even under perturbation-based evaluation scenarios. Performance assessments indicate that probabilistic representations achieve greater adaptability in domain-specific applications, mitigating the need for extensive retraining when shifting across linguistic domains. Computational trade-offs remain within operationally feasible limits, with marginal increases in inference latency balanced against the benefits of enhanced representation stability and contextual expressiveness. The capacity to encode structured uncertainty provides advantages in generative modeling tasks, particularly where maintaining coherence across extended sequences requires a representation framework capable of handling ambiguous or context-dependent linguistic constructs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Chi, Maureen de Seyssel, Natalie Schluter</p>
<p>Abstract: Spoken language understanding research to date has generally carried a heavy text perspective. Most datasets are derived from text, which is then subsequently synthesized into speech, and most models typically rely on automatic transcriptions of speech. This is to the detriment of prosody--additional information carried by the speech signal beyond the phonetics of the words themselves and difficult to recover from text alone. In this work, we investigate the role of prosody in Spoken Question Answering. By isolating prosodic and lexical information on the SLUE-SQA-5 dataset, which consists of natural speech, we demonstrate that models trained on prosodic information alone can perform reasonably well by utilizing prosodic cues. However, we find that when lexical information is available, models tend to predominantly rely on it. Our findings suggest that while prosodic cues provide valuable supplementary information, more effective integration methods are required to ensure prosody contributes more significantly alongside lexical features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baturay Saglam, Zhuoran Yang, Dionysis Kalogerias, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through example-based prompts without requiring parameter updates. However, understanding how tasks are internally encoded and generalized remains a challenge. To address some of the empirical and technical gaps in the literature, we introduce an automated formulation for encoding task information in ICL prompts as a function of attention heads within the transformer architecture. This approach computes a single task vector as a weighted sum of attention heads, with the weights optimized causally via gradient descent. Our findings show that existing methods fail to generalize effectively to modalities beyond text. In response, we also design a benchmark to evaluate whether a task vector can preserve task fidelity in functional regression tasks. The proposed method successfully extracts task-specific information from in-context demonstrations and excels in both text and regression tasks, demonstrating its generalizability across modalities. Moreover, ablation studies show that our method's effectiveness stems from aligning the distribution of the last hidden state with that of an optimally performing in-context-learned model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natasha Martus, Sebastian Crowther, Maxwell Dorrington, Jonathan Applethwaite, Edgar Tillinghurst, Quentin Birkenshaw, Lukas Petrov, Constance Willoughby</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of structured hierarchical embeddings into transformer-based architectures introduces a refined approach to lexical representation, ensuring that multi-scale semantic relationships are preserved without compromising computational efficiency. A projection mechanism that maps tokens onto a structured manifold provides improved lexical alignment, enhancing the adaptability of word representations across diverse linguistic tasks. The structured encoding framework ensures that hierarchical embeddings maintain coherence across varying abstraction levels, allowing for stable transitions between localized syntactic features and global semantic structures. Experimental evaluations indicate that hierarchical embeddings consistently outperform conventional token representations, improving accuracy in linguistic benchmarks while maintaining lower computational overhead. Comparative analysis across multiple domains highlights the ability of hierarchical embeddings to retain contextual consistency, particularly in specialized language applications where structured lexical alignment is essential. Statistical assessments further demonstrate that hierarchical embeddings exhibit enhanced robustness under perturbation conditions, ensuring that linguistic structures remain stable across adversarial text modifications. The integration of hierarchical projections with transformer attention mechanisms enables improved contextual adaptation, ensuring that token representations are dynamically adjusted based on varying linguistic distributions. The refined hierarchical organization of embeddings provides greater interpretability in lexical modeling, facilitating enhanced generalization capabilities across diverse text processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Yang, Ting Hua, Shangqian Gao, Binfeng Xu, Zheng Tang, Jie Xu, Hongxia Jin, Vijay Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved significant success, their reliance on large volumes of human-annotated data has limited their potential for further scaling. In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingtong Yu, Zechuan Gong, Chang Zhou, Yuan Fang, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are able to model interconnected entities in many online services, supporting a wide range of applications on the Web. This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhe Chen, Sven Koenig, Bistra Dilkina</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent release of OpenAI's o1 models and other similar frameworks showcasing test-time scaling laws has demonstrated their exceptional capability to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by this, subsequent research has revealed that such test-time scaling laws hinge on the model's ability to search both within a single response (intra-response) and across multiple responses (inter-response) during training. Crucially, beyond selecting a single optimal response, the model must also develop robust self-correction capabilities within its own outputs. However, training models to achieve effective self-evaluation and self-correction remains a significant challenge, heavily dependent on the quality of self-reflection data. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing the quality of self-reflection data generation for complex problem-solving, which can subsequently improve the training of next-generation large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore how manually triggering a model's self-correction mechanisms can improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel iterative deepening sampling algorithm framework designed to enhance self-correction and generate higher-quality samples. Through extensive experiments on Math500 and AIME benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate on difficult tasks and provide detailed ablation studies to analyze its effectiveness across diverse settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingheng Ye, Shen Wang, Deqing Zou, Yibo Yan, Kun Wang, Hai-Tao Zheng, Zenglin Xu, Irwin King, Philip S. Yu, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent efforts have begun integrating large language models (LLMs) into foreign language education (FLE), they often rely on traditional approaches to learning tasks without fully embracing educational methodologies, thus lacking adaptability to language learning. To address this gap, we argue that LLMs have the potential to serve as effective tutors in FLE. Specifically, LLMs can play three critical roles: (1) as data enhancers, improving the creation of learning materials or serving as student simulations; (2) as task predictors, serving as learner assessment or optimizing learning pathway; and (3) as agents, enabling personalized and inclusive education. We encourage interdisciplinary research to explore these roles, fostering innovation while addressing challenges and risks, ultimately advancing FLE through the thoughtful integration of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Liu, Chengtao Gan, Junjie Wang, Yichi Zhang, Zhongpu Bo, Mengshu Sun, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically developed by fine-tuning general-purposed LLMs with large-scale domain-specific corpora. However, training on large-scale corpora often fails to effectively organize domain knowledge of LLMs, leading to fragmented understanding. Inspired by how humans connect concepts and organize knowledge through mind maps, we aim to emulate this approach by using ontology with hierarchical conceptual knowledge to reorganize LLM's domain knowledge. From this perspective, we propose an ontology-driven self-training framework called OntoTune, which aims to align LLMs with ontology through in-context learning, enabling the generation of responses guided by the ontology. We leverage in-context learning to identify whether the LLM has acquired the specific concept's ontology knowledge, and select the entries not yet mastered by LLM as the training set to further align the LLM with ontology. Compared to existing domain LLMs based on newly collected large-scale domain-specific corpora, our OntoTune, which relies on the existing, long-term developed ontology and LLM itself, significantly reduces data maintenance costs and offers improved generalization ability. We conduct our study in the medical domain to evaluate the effectiveness of OntoTune, utilizing a standardized medical ontology, SNOMED CT as our ontology source. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoTune achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-ontology task hypernym discovery and out-of-ontology task medical domain QA. Moreover, compared to the latest direct ontology injection method TaxoLLaMA, our OntoTune better preserves original knowledge of LLM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ala N. Tak, Amin Banayeeanzade, Anahita Bolourani, Mina Kian, Robin Jia, Jonathan Gratch</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising capabilities in predicting human emotions from text. However, the mechanisms through which these models process emotional stimuli remain largely unexplored. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how autoregressive LLMs infer emotions, showing that emotion representations are functionally localized to specific regions in the model. Our evaluation includes diverse model families and sizes and is supported by robustness checks. We then show that the identified representations are psychologically plausible by drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, a well-established psychological framework positing that emotions emerge from evaluations (appraisals) of environmental stimuli. By causally intervening on construed appraisal concepts, we steer the generation and show that the outputs align with theoretical and intuitive expectations. This work highlights a novel way to causally intervene and precisely shape emotional text generation, potentially benefiting safety and alignment in sensitive affective domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning with synthesized instructions has been a common practice for adapting LLMs to domain-specific QA tasks. However, the synthesized instructions deviate from real user questions and expected answers. This study proposes a novel framework called DeepThink to generate high-quality instructions. DeepThink first generates a few seed questions to mimic actual user questions, simulates conversations to uncover the hidden user needs, and refines the answer by conversational contexts and the retrieved documents for more comprehensive answers. Experiments demonstrate that DeepThink achieves an average performance improvement of 7.92% compared to a GPT-4-turbo+RAG-based assistant on the real user test set in the advertising domain across dimensions such as relevance, completeness, clarity, accuracy, and actionability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemiao Zhang, Feiyu Duan, Liangyu Xu, Yongwei Zhou, Sirui Wang, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced human language understanding and generation, with pretraining data quality and organization being crucial to their performance. Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining Strategy (FRAMES), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAMES achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random sampling across MMLU and CMMLU, effectively boosting LLM performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05553">Latent Structure Modulation in Large Language Models Through Stochastic Concept Embedding Transitions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Whitaker, Colin Sisate, Marcel Windsor, Nikolai Fairweather, Tarquin Goldborough, Oskar Lindenfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic embedding transitions introduce a probabilistic mechanism for adjusting token representations dynamically during inference, mitigating the constraints imposed through static or deterministic embeddings. A transition framework was proposed in which each token embedding evolved through probabilistic updates, ensuring adaptability while preserving semantic integrity across linguistic contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that models incorporating stochastic transitions exhibited greater lexical diversity, improved generative coherence, and enhanced retention of low-frequency vocabulary, contributing to more varied sentence structures and reduced reliance on high-probability token selections. Statistical analyses of embedding drift across transformer layers indicated that representations evolved more flexibly without losing coherence, supporting the hypothesis that controlled stochasticity facilitated context-sensitive representation learning. Experimental results revealed that probabilistic embeddings introduced minor computational overhead while maintaining generative efficiency, reinforcing their feasibility in large-scale applications. A comparative study with traditional embedding approaches highlighted measurable gains in text completion accuracy, dialogue coherence, and structural complexity, confirming the effectiveness of stochastic transitions in enhancing representation expressiveness. Clustering patterns in the embedding space suggested that probabilistic updates preserved meaningful semantic groupings while enabling context-driven shifts, further validating the stability of the transition mechanism. Performance metrics indicated that stochastic transitions balanced adaptability and control, ensuring that generative outputs remained linguistically coherent without excessive randomness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of automatically translating natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal language, has demonstrated advancements with the progress of large language models (LLMs). However, a key obstacle to further advancements is the scarcity of paired datasets that align natural language with formal language. To address this challenge, we introduce ATLAS (Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data), an iterative data generation framework designed to produce large-scale, high-quality parallel theorem statements. With the proposed ATLAS running for 10 iterations, we construct an undergraduate-level dataset comprising 300k theorem statements and develop the ATLAS translator, achieving accuracies of 80.59% (pass@8) and 92.99% (pass@128) on ProofNet, significantly outperforming the base model (23.99% and 47.17%) and InternLM2-Math-Plus-7B (50.94% and 80.32%). Furthermore, the ATLAS translator also achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the high-school-level miniF2F dataset and the graduate-level MathQual dataset introduced in this work. The datasets, model, and code will be released to the public soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this survey, we systematically analyze techniques used to adapt large multimodal models (LMMs) for low-resource (LR) languages, examining approaches ranging from visual enhancement and data creation to cross-modal transfer and fusion strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of 106 studies across 75 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. We aim to provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoshi Pan, Qianhui Wu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Hao Cheng, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Chin-Yew Lin, H. Vicky Zhao, Lili Qiu, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: To deliver coherent and personalized experiences in long-term conversations, existing approaches typically perform retrieval augmented response generation by constructing memory banks from conversation history at either the turn-level, session-level, or through summarization techniques. In this paper, we present two key findings: (1) The granularity of memory unit matters: Turn-level, session-level, and summarization-based methods each exhibit limitations in both memory retrieval accuracy and the semantic quality of the retrieved content. (2) Prompt compression methods, such as \textit{LLMLingua-2}, can effectively serve as a denoising mechanism, enhancing memory retrieval accuracy across different granularities. Building on these insights, we propose SeCom, a method that constructs a memory bank with topical segments by introducing a conversation Segmentation model, while performing memory retrieval based on Compressed memory units. Experimental results show that SeCom outperforms turn-level, session-level, and several summarization-based methods on long-term conversation benchmarks such as LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+. Additionally, the proposed conversation segmentation method demonstrates superior performance on dialogue segmentation datasets such as DialSeg711, TIAGE, and SuperDialSeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcheng Zeng, Xinyu Cui, Xuanfa Jin, Guoqing Liu, Zexu Sun, Quan He, Dong Li, Ning Yang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A truly intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) should be capable of correcting errors in its responses through external interactions. However, even the most advanced models often face challenges in improving their outputs. In this paper, we explore how to cultivate LLMs with the self-refinement capability through iterative preference training, and how this ability can be leveraged to improve model performance during inference. To this end, we introduce a novel post-training and inference framework, called ARIES: Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Enhancement Structure. This method iteratively performs preference training and self-refinement-based data collection. During training, ARIES strengthen the model's direct question-answering capability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. During inference, ARIES harnesses this self-refinement capability to generate a series of progressively refined responses, which are then filtered using either the Reward Model Scoring or a simple yet effective Rule-Based Selection mechanism, specifically tailored to our approach, to construct a dataset for the next round of preference training. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of ARIES. When applied to the Llama-3.1-8B model and under the self-refinement setting, ARIES surpasses powerful models such as GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled (LC) and a 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, outperforming Iterative DPO by 27.8% and 35.5% respectively, as well as a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, surpassing Iterative DPO by 26.6%. Furthermore, ARIES consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukmin Cho, Sangjin Choi, Taeho Hwang, Jeongyeon Seo, Soyeong Jeong, Huije Lee, Hoyun Song, Jong C. Park, Youngjin Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for real-time interactions, as they have been widely incorporated into real-world services. Speculative decoding, a fully algorithmic solution, has gained attention for improving inference speed by drafting and verifying tokens, thereby generating multiple tokens in a single forward pass. However, current drafting strategies usually require significant fine-tuning or have inconsistent performance across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchy Drafting (HD), a novel lossless drafting approach that organizes various token sources into multiple databases in a hierarchical framework based on temporal locality. In the drafting step, HD sequentially accesses multiple databases to obtain draft tokens from the highest to the lowest locality, ensuring consistent acceleration across diverse tasks and minimizing drafting latency. Our experiments on Spec-Bench using LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters demonstrate that HD outperforms existing database drafting methods, achieving robust inference speedups across model sizes, tasks, and temperatures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized for their exceptional generative capabilities and versatility across various tasks. However, the high inference costs associated with these models have not received adequate attention, particularly when compared to the focus on training costs in existing research. In response to this gap, our study conducts a comprehensive benchmarking of LLM inference energy across a wide range of NLP tasks, where we analyze the impact of different models, tasks, prompts, and system-related factors on inference energy. Specifically, our experiments reveal several interesting insights, including strong correlation of inference energy with output token length and response time. Also, we find that quantization and optimal batch sizes, along with targeted prompt phrases, can significantly reduce energy usage. This study is the first to thoroughly benchmark LLM inference across such a diverse range of aspects, providing insights and offering several recommendations for improving energy efficiency in model deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houcheng Jiang, Junfeng Fang, Ningyu Zhang, Guojun Ma, Mingyang Wan, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Tat-seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable expressive speech synthesis, especially in text-to-speech (TTS) models, have allowed for the generation of speech with specific styles guided by textual descriptions, known as style prompts. While this development enhances the flexibility and naturalness of synthesized speech, there remains a significant gap in understanding how these models handle vague or abstract style prompts. This study investigates the potential gender bias in how models interpret occupation-related prompts, specifically examining their responses to instructions like "Act like a nurse". We explore whether these models exhibit tendencies to amplify gender stereotypes when interpreting such prompts. Our experimental results reveal the model's tendency to exhibit gender bias for certain occupations. Moreover, models of different sizes show varying degrees of this bias across these occupations.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a novel task of incongruence detection in eyewitness testimonies. Given a pair of testimonies containing of multiple pairs of question and answer by two subjects, we identify contextually related incongruence between the two subjects. We also mark the span of incongruences in the utterances. To achieve this, we developed MIND(MultI-EyewitNess Deception) - a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2927 pairs of contextually related answers designed to capture both explicit and implicit contradictions. INstruction - TunEd iNcongruity Detection framework based on 6W and multi-hop reasoning approach, aka. INTEND. Drawing from investigative techniques, INTEND address the task as a close-style problem, contradicting on the who, what, when, where and why aspect of the content. Our findings shows that prompt tuning, especially when utilizing our framework, enhances the detection of incongruences by a margin of +5.63 percent. We compare our approach with multiple fine-tuning and prompt tuning techniques on MLMs and LLMs. Emperical results demonstrate convincing performance improvement in F1-score over fine-tuned and regular prompt-tuning techniques, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has led to the rise of AI-driven mental health chatbots, though challenges related to privacy, data collection, and expertise persist. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then, we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI, containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues. Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code generation and problem solving. Current approaches employ external tool-based iterative debuggers that use compiler or other tool-based runtime feedback to refine coarse programs generated by various methods. However, the effectiveness of these approaches heavily relies on the quality of the initial code generation, which remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce CodeSim, a novel multi-agent code generation framework that comprehensively addresses the stages of program synthesis-planning, coding, and debugging-through a human-like perception approach. As human verifies their understanding of any algorithms through visual simulation, CodeSim uniquely features a method of plan verification and internal debugging through the step-by-step simulation of input/output. Extensive experiments across seven challenging competitive problem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks demonstrate CodeSim's remarkable code generation capabilities. Our framework achieves new state-of-the-art (pass@1) results-(HumanEval 95.1%, MBPP 90.7%, APPS 22%, and CodeContests 29.1%). Furthermore, our method shows potential for even greater enhancement when cascaded with external debuggers. To facilitate further research and development in this area, we have open-sourced our framework in this link (https://kagnlp.github.io/codesim.github.io/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ada Defne Tur, Gaurav Kamath, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Though English sentences are typically inflexible vis-\`a-vis word order, constituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory presents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with constituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such theories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP), because while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the performance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how these models process language, and how this compares to human language processing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same patterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing theories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a variety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on four types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative alternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle movement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent ordering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkatesh Mishra, Bimsara Pathiraja, Mihir Parmar, Sat Chidananda, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Ali Payani, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning abilities of LLMs have been a key focus in recent years. One challenging reasoning domain with interesting nuances is legal reasoning, which requires careful application of rules, and precedents while balancing deductive and analogical reasoning, and conflicts between rules. Although there have been a few works on using LLMs for legal reasoning, their focus has been on overall accuracy. In this paper, we dig deeper to do a step-by-step analysis and figure out where they commit errors. We use the college-level Multiple Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) task from the \textit{Civil Procedure} dataset and propose a new error taxonomy derived from initial manual analysis of reasoning chains with respect to several LLMs, including two objective measures: soundness and correctness scores. We then develop an LLM-based automated evaluation framework to identify reasoning errors and evaluate the performance of LLMs. The computation of soundness and correctness on the dataset using the auto-evaluator framework reveals several interesting insights. Furthermore, we show that incorporating the error taxonomy as feedback in popular prompting techniques marginally increases LLM performance. Our work will also serve as an evaluation framework that can be used in detailed error analysis of reasoning chains for logic-intensive complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoshuai Du, Yiyi Tao, Yixian Shen, Hang Zhang, Yanxin Shen, Xinyu Qiu, Chuanqi Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the performance of various large language models (LLMs) on zero-shot end-to-end relation extraction (RE) in Chinese, a task that integrates entity recognition and relation extraction without requiring annotated data. While LLMs show promise for RE, most prior work focuses on English or assumes pre-annotated entities, leaving their effectiveness in Chinese RE largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we evaluate ChatGPT, Gemini, and LLaMA based on accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability. ChatGPT demonstrates the highest overall performance, balancing precision and recall, while Gemini achieves the fastest inference speed, making it suitable for real-time applications. LLaMA underperforms in both accuracy and latency, highlighting the need for further adaptation. Our findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for zero-shot Chinese RE, shedding light on trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. This study serves as a foundation for future research aimed at improving LLM adaptability to complex linguistic tasks in Chinese NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlyn Zhou, Haishan Gao, Sarah Chen, Dan Edelstein, Dan Jurafsky, Chen Shani</p>
<p>Abstract: Word similarity has many applications to social science and cultural analytics tasks like measuring meaning change over time and making sense of contested terms. Yet traditional similarity methods based on cosine similarity between word embeddings cannot capture the context-dependent, asymmetrical, polysemous nature of semantic similarity. We propose a new measure of similarity, Word Confusion, that reframes semantic similarity in terms of feature-based classification confusion. Word Confusion is inspired by Tversky's suggestion that similarity features be chosen dynamically. Here we train a classifier to map contextual embeddings to word identities and use the classifier confusion (the probability of choosing a confounding word c instead of the correct target word t) as a measure of the similarity of c and t. The set of potential confounding words acts as the chosen features. Our method is comparable to cosine similarity in matching human similarity judgments across several datasets (MEN, WirdSim353, and SimLex), and can measure similarity using predetermined features of interest. We demonstrate our model's ability to make use of dynamic features by applying it to test a hypothesis about changes in the 18th C. meaning of the French word "revolution" from popular to state action during the French Revolution. We hope this reimagining of semantic similarity will inspire the development of new tools that better capture the multi-faceted and dynamic nature of language, advancing the fields of computational social science and cultural analytics and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces BnTTS (Bangla Text-To-Speech), the first framework for Bangla speaker adaptation-based TTS, designed to bridge the gap in Bangla speech synthesis using minimal training data. Building upon the XTTS architecture, our approach integrates Bangla into a multilingual TTS pipeline, with modifications to account for the phonetic and linguistic characteristics of the language. We pre-train BnTTS on 3.85k hours of Bangla speech dataset with corresponding text labels and evaluate performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings on our proposed test dataset. Empirical evaluations in few-shot settings show that BnTTS significantly improves the naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker fidelity of synthesized Bangla speech. Compared to state-of-the-art Bangla TTS systems, BnTTS exhibits superior performance in Subjective Mean Opinion Score (SMOS), Naturalness, and Clarity metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zherui Li, Houcheng Jiang, Hao Chen, Baolong Bi, Zhenhong Zhou, Fei Sun, Junfeng Fang, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihao Chen, Chaitanya Malaviya, Alex Fabrikant, Hagai Taitelbaum, Tal Schuster, Senaka Buthpitiya, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit the reference determinacy (RD) assumption in the task of natural language inference (NLI), i.e., the premise and hypothesis are assumed to refer to the same context when human raters annotate a label. While RD is a practical assumption for constructing a new NLI dataset, we observe that current NLI models, which are typically trained solely on hypothesis-premise pairs created with the RD assumption, fail in downstream applications such as fact verification, where the input premise and hypothesis may refer to different contexts. To highlight the impact of this phenomenon in real-world use cases, we introduce RefNLI, a diagnostic benchmark for identifying reference ambiguity in NLI examples. In RefNLI, the premise is retrieved from a knowledge source (i.e., Wikipedia) and does not necessarily refer to the same context as the hypothesis. With RefNLI, we demonstrate that finetuned NLI models and few-shot prompted LLMs both fail to recognize context mismatch, leading to over 80% false contradiction and over 50% entailment predictions. We discover that the existence of reference ambiguity in NLI examples can in part explain the inherent human disagreements in NLI and provide insight into how the RD assumption impacts the NLI dataset creation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathlyn Eaglewood, Tobias Featherington, Dorian Mayfair, Sylvester Grimshaw, James Pettigrew</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic perturbations offer a novel approach for influencing neural representations without requiring direct modification of model parameters. The recursive regeneration of symbolic structures introduces structured variations in latent embeddings, leading to controlled shifts in attention dynamics and lexical diversity across sequential generations. A comparative analysis with conventional fine-tuning techniques reveals that structural modifications at the symbolic level induce distinct variations in contextual sensitivity while maintaining overall model fluency and coherence. Shifts in attention weight distributions highlight the role of symbolic modifications in adjusting token dependencies, influencing response variability, and refining long-form text generation. Experimental findings suggest that symbolic perturbations can enhance adaptability in domain-specific applications, allowing modifications in model behavior without retraining. Evaluations of semantic drift indicate that recursive regeneration alters long-range token dependencies, affecting topic coherence across extended text sequences. Results from lexical variability assessments further support the conclusion that symbolic-level modifications introduce interpretable variations in generated responses, potentially enabling more controlled stylistic adjustments in automated text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Peng Huang, Hao-Yuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in natural language processing but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect or fabricated content. This issue undermines their reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and legal advisory. To address this challenge, we propose Delta, an inference-time method that reduces hallucinations without requiring model retraining or additional data. Delta works by randomly masking parts of the input prompt and contrasting the output distributions for the original and masked inputs, effectively suppressing hallucinations through inference-only computations. We evaluate Delta on context-rich question-answering benchmarks, achieving absolute improvements of approximately 3 and 6 percentage points on SQuAD v1.1 and v2, respectively, and 7 and 2 percentage points on TriviaQA and Natural Questions under-sampling decoding. Delta also improves the no-answer exact match score on SQuAD v2 by over ten percentage points, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations arising from contextual ambiguity. These results highlight Delta as a computationally efficient and scalable approach for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Kumar Nigam, Tanmay Dubey, Govind Sharma, Noel Shallum, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Arnab Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of semantic segmentation of legal documents through rhetorical role classification, with a focus on Indian legal judgments. We introduce LegalSeg, the largest annotated dataset for this task, comprising over 7,000 documents and 1.4 million sentences, labeled with 7 rhetorical roles. To benchmark performance, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models, including Hierarchical BiLSTM-CRF, TransformerOverInLegalBERT (ToInLegalBERT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Role-Aware Transformers, alongside an exploratory RhetoricLLaMA, an instruction-tuned large language model. Our results demonstrate that models incorporating broader context, structural relationships, and sequential sentence information outperform those relying solely on sentence-level features. Additionally, we conducted experiments using surrounding context and predicted or actual labels of neighboring sentences to assess their impact on classification accuracy. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in distinguishing between closely related roles and addressing class imbalance. Our work underscores the potential of advanced techniques for improving legal document understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in legal NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Yuhang Yan, Linqi Liu, Yixin Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Kai-Wei Chang, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of incorrect images, such as depictions of people of color in Nazi-era uniforms by Gemini, frustrated users and harmed Google's reputation, motivating us to investigate the relationship between accurately reflecting factuality and promoting diversity and equity. In this study, we focus on 19 real-world statistics collected from authoritative sources. Using these statistics, we develop a checklist comprising objective and subjective queries to analyze behavior of large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models. Objective queries assess the models' ability to provide accurate world knowledge. In contrast, the design of subjective queries follows a key principle: statistical or experiential priors should not be overgeneralized to individuals, ensuring that models uphold diversity. These subjective queries are based on three common human cognitive errors that often result in social biases. We propose metrics to assess factuality and fairness, and formally prove the inherent trade-off between these two aspects. Results show that GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 perform notably well among six LLMs and four T2I models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/uclanlp/Fact-or-Fair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain prone to factual inaccuracies and computational errors, including hallucinations and mistakes in mathematical reasoning. Recent work augmented LLMs with tools to mitigate these shortcomings, but often requires curated gold tool-use demonstrations. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can learn to use tools without demonstrations. First, we analyse zero-shot prompting strategies to guide LLMs in tool utilisation. Second, we propose a self-training method to synthesise tool-use traces using the LLM itself. We compare supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning techniques for fine-tuning the model on datasets constructed using existing Question Answering (QA) datasets, i.e., TriviaQA and GSM8K. Experiments show that tool-use enhances performance on a long-tail knowledge task: 3.7% on PopQA, which is used solely for evaluation, but leads to mixed results on other datasets, i.e., TriviaQA, GSM8K, and NQ-Open. Our findings highlight the potential and challenges of integrating external tools into LLMs without demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock movement prediction, a fundamental task in financial time-series forecasting, requires identifying and retrieving critical influencing factors from vast amounts of time-series data. However, existing text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods fall short in handling complex financial analysis. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for financial time-series forecasting, featuring three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B parameter large language model (StockLLM) as the backbone, a novel candidate selection method leveraging LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. This enables our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while minimizing noise in complex financial data. We also construct new datasets integrating financial indicators and historical stock prices to train FinSeer and ensure robust evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms bare StockLLM and random retrieval, highlighting its effectiveness, while FinSeer surpasses existing retrieval methods, achieving an 8\% higher accuracy on BIGDATA22 and retrieving more impactful sequences. This work underscores the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel framework for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Teng, Jiaqing Liu, Rahul Kumar Jain, Shurong Chai, Ruibo Hou, Tomoko Tateyama, Lanfen Lin, Yen-wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, posing a severe burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and society at large. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in addressing mental health challenges, including the detection of depression through text-based analysis. However, current LLM-based methods often struggle with nuanced symptom identification and lack a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process, making it difficult to accurately classify and explain mental health conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a Chain-of-Thought Prompting approach that enhances both the performance and interpretability of LLM-based depression detection. Our method breaks down the detection process into four stages: (1) sentiment analysis, (2) binary depression classification, (3) identification of underlying causes, and (4) assessment of severity. By guiding the model through these structured reasoning steps, we improve interpretability and reduce the risk of overlooking subtle clinical indicators. We validate our method on the E-DAIC dataset, where we test multiple state-of-the-art large language models. Experimental results indicate that our Chain-of-Thought Prompting technique yields superior performance in both classification accuracy and the granularity of diagnostic insights, compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics is critical for conversational agents, enabling effective content analysis and informed decision-making. However, time-aware datasets, particularly for persona-grounded conversations, are still limited, which narrows their scope and diminishes their complexity. To address this gap, we introduce MTPChat, a multimodal, time-aware persona dialogue dataset that integrates linguistic, visual, and temporal elements within dialogue and persona memory. Leveraging MTPChat, we propose two time-sensitive tasks: Temporal Next Response Prediction (TNRP) and Temporal Grounding Memory Prediction (TGMP), both designed to assess a model's ability to understand implicit temporal cues and dynamic interactions. Additionally, we present an innovative framework featuring an adaptive temporal module to effectively integrate multimodal streams and capture temporal dependencies. Experimental results validate the challenges posed by MTPChat and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multimodal time-sensitive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Ficarra, Ryan Cotterell, Alex Warstadt</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being studied as models of human language learners. Due to the nascency of the field, it is not well-established whether LMs exhibit similar learning dynamics to humans, and there are few direct comparisons between learning trajectories in humans and models. Word learning trajectories for children are relatively well-documented, and recent work has tried to extend these investigations to language models. However, there are no widely agreed-upon metrics for word learning in language models. We take a distributional approach to this problem, defining lexical knowledge in terms of properties of the learned distribution for a target word. We argue that distributional signatures studied in prior work fail to capture key distributional information. Thus, we propose an array of signatures that improve on earlier approaches by capturing knowledge of both where the target word can and cannot occur as well as gradient preferences about the word's appropriateness. We obtain learning trajectories for a selection of small language models we train from scratch, study the relationship between different distributional signatures, compare how well they align with human word learning trajectories and interpretable lexical features, and address basic methodological questions about estimating these distributional signatures. Our metrics largely capture complementary information, suggesting that it is important not to rely on a single metric. However, across all metrics, language models' learning trajectories fail to correlate with those of children.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runchuan Zhu, Zinco Jiang, Jiang Wu, Zhipeng Ma, Jiahe Song, Fengshuo Bai, Dahua Lin, Lijun Wu, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (RAIT) aims to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by improving their ability to refuse responses to questions beyond their knowledge, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving reliability. Effective RAIT must address two key challenges: firstly, effectively reject unknown questions to minimize hallucinations; secondly, avoid over-refusal to ensure questions that can be correctly answered are not rejected, thereby maintain the helpfulness of LLM outputs. In this paper, we address the two challenges by deriving insightful observations from the gradient-based perspective, and proposing the Gradient-driven Refusal Aware Instruction Tuning Framework GRAIT: (1) employs gradient-driven sample selection to effectively minimize hallucinations and (2) introduces an adaptive weighting mechanism during fine-tuning to reduce the risk of over-refusal, achieving the balance between accurate refusals and maintaining useful responses. Experimental evaluations on open-ended and multiple-choice question answering tasks demonstrate that GRAIT significantly outperforms existing RAIT methods in the overall performance.

<p>Abstract: We propose ARISE, a framework that iteratively induces rules and generates synthetic data for text classification. We combine synthetic data generation and automatic rule induction, via bootstrapping, to iteratively filter the generated rules and data. We induce rules via inductive generalisation of syntactic n-grams, enabling us to capture a complementary source of supervision. These rules alone lead to performance gains in both, in-context learning (ICL) and fine-tuning (FT) settings. Similarly, use of augmented data from ARISE alone improves the performance for a model, outperforming configurations that rely on complex methods like contrastive learning. Further, our extensive experiments on various datasets covering three full-shot, eight few-shot and seven multilingual variant settings demonstrate that the rules and data we generate lead to performance improvements across these diverse domains and languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongye Liu, Ricardo Henao</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart word substitution aims to enhance sentence quality by improving word choices; however current benchmarks rely on human-labeled data. Since word choices are inherently subjective, ground-truth word substitutions generated by a small group of annotators are often incomplete and likely not generalizable. To circumvent this issue, we instead employ a model-based score (BARTScore) to quantify sentence quality, thus forgoing the need for human annotations. Specifically, we use this score to define a distribution for each word substitution, allowing one to test whether a substitution is statistically superior relative to others. In addition, we propose a loss function that directly optimizes the alignment between model predictions and sentence scores, while also enhancing the overall quality score of a substitution. Crucially, model learning no longer requires human labels, thus avoiding the cost of annotation while maintaining the quality of the text modified with substitutions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms both masked language models (BERT, BART) and large language models (GPT-4, LLaMA).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jackson Coleman, Isaiah Lawrence, Benjamin Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source multi-hop question answering (QA) represents a challenging task in natural language processing due to the need for dynamic integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods often suffer from cascading errors, insufficient handling of knowledge conflicts, and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Multi-source Knowledge-Oriented Reasoning (AMKOR), a generative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically fuse parametric and retrieved knowledge while exploring reasoning trajectories using probabilistic beam reasoning. AMKOR is further enhanced by a multi-granular learning strategy, optimizing both local reasoning steps and global answer accuracy. Experiments conducted on four widely-used multi-hop QA datasets, including HotpotQA and MuSiQue, demonstrate that AMKOR achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods on both reasoning accuracy and robustness. Additional analyses confirm its scalability, adaptability to noisy knowledge, and superior ability to handle complex multi-hop tasks. This work establishes a new benchmark for multi-source multi-hop QA by effectively combining reasoning quality and efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05945">&quot;Let the AI conspiracy begin...&quot; Language Model coordination is just one inference-intervention away</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Darm, Annalisa Riccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a straightforward and effective methodology to steer large language model behaviour capable of bypassing learned alignment goals. We employ interference-time activation shifting, which is effective without additional training. Following prior studies, we derive intervention directions from activation differences in contrastive pairs of model outputs, which represent the desired and undesired behaviour. By prompting the model to include multiple-choice answers in its response, we can automatically evaluate the sensitivity of model output to individual attention heads steering efforts. We demonstrate that interventions on these heads generalize well to open-ended answer generation in the challenging "AI coordination" dataset. In this dataset, models must choose between assisting another AI or adhering to ethical, safe, and unharmful behaviour. Our fine-grained interventions lead Llama 2 to prefer coordination with other AIs over following established alignment goals. Additionally, this approach enables stronger interventions than those applied to whole model layers, preserving the overall cohesiveness of the output. The simplicity of our method highlights the shortcomings of current alignment strategies and points to potential future research directions, as concepts like "AI coordination" can be influenced by selected attention heads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jules R. Kala, Emmanuel Adetiba, Abdultaofeek Abayom, Oluwatobi E. Dare, Ayodele H. Ifijeh</p>
<p>Abstract: A cascade-based speech-to-speech translation has been considered a benchmark for a very long time, but it is plagued by many issues, like the time taken to translate a speech from one language to another and compound errors. These issues are because a cascade-based method uses a combination of methods such as speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and finally, text-to-speech translation. Translatotron, a sequence-to-sequence direct speech-to-speech translation model was designed by Google to address the issues of compound errors associated with cascade model. Today there are 3 versions of the Translatotron model: Translatotron 1, Translatotron 2, and Translatotron3. The first version was designed as a proof of concept to show that a direct speech-to-speech translation was possible, it was found to be less effective than the cascade model but was producing promising results. Translatotron2 was an improved version of Translatotron 1 with results similar to the cascade model. Translatotron 3 the latest version of the model is better than the cascade model at some points. In this paper, a complete review of speech-to-speech translation will be presented, with a particular focus on all the versions of Translatotron models. We will also show that Translatotron is the best model to bridge the language gap between African Languages and other well-formalized languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amin Abbasi, Farnaz Sadat Mirnezami, Hassan Naderi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents HamRaz, a novel Persian-language mental health dataset designed for Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite the growing application of LLMs in AI-driven psychological counseling, existing datasets predominantly focus on Western and East Asian contexts, overlooking cultural and linguistic nuances essential for effective Persian-language therapy. To address this gap, HamRaz combines script-based dialogues with adaptive LLM role-playing, ensuring coherent and dynamic therapy interactions. We also introduce HamRazEval, a dual evaluation framework that measures conversational quality and therapeutic effectiveness using General Dialogue Metrics and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI). Experimental results show HamRaz outperforms conventional Script Mode and Two-Agent Mode, producing more empathetic, context-aware, and realistic therapy sessions. By releasing HamRaz, we contribute a culturally adapted, LLM-driven resource to advance AI-powered psychotherapy research in diverse communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ohav Barbi, Ori Yoran, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems, where specialized agents collaborate to solve a shared task hold great potential, from increased modularity to simulating complex environments. However, they also have a major caveat -- a single agent can cause the entire system to fail. Consider a simple game where the knowledge to solve the task is distributed between agents, which share information in a communication channel. At each round, any of the agents can terminate the game and make the final prediction, even if they are uncertain about the outcome of their action. Detection of such rogue agents $\textit{before they act}$ may prevent the system's failure. In this work, we propose to $\textit{monitor}$ agents during action prediction and $\textit{intervene}$ when a future error is likely to occur. To test our approach, we introduce WhoDunitEnv, a multi-agent collaboration environment that allows modular control over task complexity and communication structure. Experiments on two variants of WhoDunitEnv and the GovSim environment for resource sustainability show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains up to 17.4% and 20%, respectively. Moreover, a thorough analysis shows that our monitors successfully identify critical points of agent confusion and our interventions effectively stop agent errors from propagating.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Porwal, Alice Rozet, Pryce Houck, Jotsna Gowda, Sarah Moeller, Kevin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: African American English (AAE) presents unique challenges in natural language processing (NLP). This research systematically compares the performance of available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique linguistic characteristics. Data and code are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikun Kang, Wenqi Wu, Filippos Christianos, Alex J. Chan, Fraser Greenlee, George Thomas, Marvin Purtorab, Andy Toulis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Large Memory Model (LM2), a decoder-only Transformer architecture enhanced with an auxiliary memory module that aims to address the limitations of standard Transformers in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and synthesizing information distributed over long contexts. The proposed LM2 incorporates a memory module that acts as a contextual representation repository, interacting with input tokens via cross attention and updating through gating mechanisms. To preserve the Transformers general-purpose capabilities, LM2 maintains the original information flow while integrating a complementary memory pathway. Experimental results on the BABILong benchmark demonstrate that the LM2model outperforms both the memory-augmented RMT model by 37.1% and the baseline Llama-3.2 model by 86.3% on average across tasks. LM2 exhibits exceptional capabilities in multi-hop inference, numerical reasoning, and large-context question-answering. On the MMLU dataset, it achieves a 5.0% improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model, demonstrating that its memory module does not degrade performance on general tasks. Further, in our analysis, we explore the memory interpretability, effectiveness of memory modules, and test-time behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of explicit memory in enhancing Transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Razavi, Mina Soltangheis, Negar Arabzadeh, Sara Salamat, Morteza Zihayat, Ebrahim Bagheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to variations in prompt formulation, which can significantly impact their ability to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Prompt Sensitivity Prediction, and a dataset PromptSET designed to investigate the effects of slight prompt variations on LLM performance. Using TriviaQA and HotpotQA datasets as the foundation of our work, we generate prompt variations and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple LLMs. We benchmark the prompt sensitivity prediction task employing state-of-the-art methods from related tasks, including LLM-based self-evaluation, text classification, and query performance prediction techniques. Our findings reveal that existing methods struggle to effectively address prompt sensitivity prediction, underscoring the need to understand how information needs should be phrased for accurate LLM responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokwon Song, Taehyun Lee, Jaewoo Ahn, Jae Hyuk Sung, Gunhee Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Conceptual combination is a cognitive process that merges basic concepts, enabling the creation of complex expressions. During this process, the properties of combination (e.g., the whiteness of a peeled apple) can be inherited from basic concepts, newly emerge, or be canceled. However, previous studies have evaluated a limited set of properties and have not examined the generative process. To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly. Our key findings are threefold: (1) Our automatic metric grading property emergence and cancellation closely corresponds with human judgments. (2) LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, struggle to generate noun phrases which possess given emergent properties. (3) Our proposed method, inspired by cognitive psychology model that explains how relationships between concepts are formed, improves performances in all generative tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06087">ConMeC: A Dataset for Metonymy Resolution with Common Nouns</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Ghosh, Tianyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Metonymy plays an important role in our daily communication. People naturally think about things using their most salient properties or commonly related concepts. For example, by saying "The bus decided to skip our stop today," we actually mean that the bus driver made the decision, not the bus. Prior work on metonymy resolution has mainly focused on named entities. However, metonymy involving common nouns (such as desk, baby, and school) is also a frequent and challenging phenomenon. We argue that NLP systems should be capable of identifying the metonymic use of common nouns in context. We create a new metonymy dataset ConMeC, which consists of 6,000 sentences, where each sentence is paired with a target common noun and annotated by humans to indicate whether that common noun is used metonymically or not in that context. We also introduce a chain-of-thought based prompting method for detecting metonymy using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate our LLM-based pipeline, as well as a supervised BERT model on our dataset and three other metonymy datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs could achieve performance comparable to the supervised BERT model on well-defined metonymy categories, while still struggling with instances requiring nuanced semantic understanding. Our dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/SaptGhosh/ConMeC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) have significantly advanced generative modeling in natural language processing (NLP). Despite their success, LMs often struggle with adaptation to new contexts in real-time applications. A promising approach to task adaptation is activation intervention, which steers the LMs' generation process by identifying and manipulating the activations. However, existing interventions are highly dependent on heuristic rules or require many prompt inputs to determine effective interventions. This paper proposes a layer-wise additive activation intervention framework that optimizes the intervention process, thus enhancing the sample efficiency. We benchmark our framework on various datasets, demonstrating improvements in the accuracy of pre-trained LMs and competing intervention baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumin An, Junyoung Sung, Wonpyo Park, Chanjun Park, Paul Hongsuck Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent and contextually rich outputs, their capacity to efficiently handle long-form contexts is limited by fixed-length position embeddings. Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal documents including judgments and court orders require highly sophisticated legal knowledge for understanding. To disclose expert knowledge for non-experts, we explore the problem of visualizing legal texts with easy-to-understand diagrams and propose a novel dataset of LegalViz with 23 languages and 7,010 cases of legal document and visualization pairs, using the DOT graph description language of Graphviz. LegalViz provides a simple diagram from a complicated legal corpus identifying legal entities, transactions, legal sources, and statements at a glance, that are essential in each judgment. In addition, we provide new evaluation metrics for the legal diagram visualization by considering graph structures, textual similarities, and legal contents. We conducted empirical studies on few-shot and finetuning large language models for generating legal diagrams and evaluated them with these metrics, including legal content-based evaluation within 23 languages. Models trained with LegalViz outperform existing models including GPTs, confirming the effectiveness of our dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Weng, Fengbin Zhu, Tong Ye, Haoyan Liu, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), has proven effective in enabling LLMs to produce more accurate and reliable responses. However, it remains a significant challenge how to effectively integrate external retrieved knowledge with internal parametric knowledge in LLMs. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Selection RAG framework, where the LLM is made to select from pairwise responses generated with internal parametric knowledge solely and with external retrieved knowledge together to achieve enhanced accuracy. To this end, we devise a Self-Selection-RGP method to enhance the capabilities of the LLM in both generating and selecting the correct answer, by training the LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) over a curated Retrieval Generation Preference (RGP) dataset. Experimental results with two open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B) well demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods on Natural Questions (NQ) and TrivialQA datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Public health researchers are increasingly interested in using social media data to study health-related behaviors, but manually labeling this data can be labor-intensive and costly. This study explores whether zero-shot labeling using large language models (LLMs) can match or surpass conventional crowd-sourced annotation for Twitter posts related to sleep disorders, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Multiple annotation pipelines were designed to compare labels produced by domain experts, crowd workers, and LLM-driven approaches under varied prompt-engineering strategies. Our findings indicate that LLMs can rival human performance in straightforward classification tasks and significantly reduce labeling time, yet their accuracy diminishes for tasks requiring more nuanced domain knowledge. These results clarify the trade-offs between automated scalability and human expertise, demonstrating conditions under which LLM-based labeling can be efficiently integrated into public health research without undermining label quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naome A. Etori, Maria L. Gini</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media has become a crucial open-access platform for individuals to express opinions and share experiences. However, leveraging low-resource language data from Twitter is challenging due to scarce, poor-quality content and the major variations in language use, such as slang and code-switching. Identifying tweets in these languages can be difficult as Twitter primarily supports high-resource languages. We analyze Kenyan code-switched data and evaluate four state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer-based pretrained models for sentiment and emotion classification, using supervised and semi-supervised methods. We detail the methodology behind data collection and annotation, and the challenges encountered during the data curation phase. Our results show that XLM-R outperforms other models; for sentiment analysis, XLM-R supervised model achieves the highest accuracy (69.2\%) and F1 score (66.1\%), XLM-R semi-supervised (67.2\% accuracy, 64.1\% F1 score). In emotion analysis, DistilBERT supervised leads in accuracy (59.8\%) and F1 score (31\%), mBERT semi-supervised (accuracy (59\% and F1 score 26.5\%). AfriBERTa models show the lowest accuracy and F1 scores. All models tend to predict neutral sentiment, with Afri-BERT showing the highest bias and unique sensitivity to empathy emotion. https://github.com/NEtori21/Ride_hailing</p>

In this work, we study factual inconsistency errors and connect them with a line of discourse analysis. We find that errors are more common in complex sentences and are associated with several discourse features. We propose a framework that decomposes long texts into discourse-inspired chunks and utilizes discourse information to better aggregate sentence-level scores predicted by natural language inference models. Our approach shows improved performance on top of different model baselines over several evaluation benchmarks, covering rich domains of texts, focusing on long document summarization. This underscores the significance of incorporating discourse features in developing models for scoring summaries for long document factual inconsistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans naturally interpret numbers non-literally, effortlessly combining context, world knowledge, and speaker intent. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers similarly, focusing on hyperbole and pragmatic halo effects. Through systematic comparison with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, we find that LLMs diverge from human interpretation in striking ways. By decomposing pragmatic reasoning into testable components, grounded in the Rational Speech Act framework, we pinpoint where LLM processing diverges from human cognition -- not in prior knowledge, but in reasoning with it. This insight leads us to develop a targeted solution -- chain-of-thought prompting inspired by an RSA model makes LLMs' interpretations more human-like. Our work demonstrates how computational cognitive models can both diagnose AI-human differences and guide development of more human-like language understanding capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a fundamental challenge in aligning independently developed retrievers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically involve modifying either component or introducing simple intermediate modules, resulting in practical limitations and sub-optimal performance. Inspired by human search behavior -- typically involving a back-and-forth process of proposing search queries and reviewing documents, we propose C-3PO, a proxy-centric framework that facilitates communication between retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. Our framework implements three specialized agents that collaboratively optimize the entire RAG pipeline without altering the retriever and LLMs. These agents work together to assess the need for retrieval, generate effective queries, and select information suitable for the LLMs. To enable effective multi-agent coordination, we develop a tree-structured rollout approach for reward credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate that C-3PO significantly enhances RAG performance while maintaining plug-and-play flexibility and superior generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are widely used for offensive language detection due to their advanced capability. However, the challenges posed by human annotation disagreement in real-world datasets remain underexplored. These disagreement samples are difficult to detect due to their ambiguous nature. Additionally, the confidence of LLMs in processing disagreement samples can provide valuable insights into their alignment with human annotators. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to detect offensive language with annotation disagreement. We compare the binary accuracy of multiple LLMs across varying annotation agreement levels and analyze the relationship between LLM confidence and annotation agreement. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of disagreement samples on LLM decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by disagreement samples and offer guidance for improving LLM-based offensive language detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Nan Yang, Liang Wang, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have led to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning across various benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks rely on automatic evaluation methods that only compare final answers using heuristics, without verifying the underlying reasoning steps. This limitation results in false positive solutions, where models may produce correct final answers but with flawed deduction paths. In this paper, we systematically examine the prevalence of false positive solutions in mathematical problem solving for language models. We analyze the characteristics and extent of this issue across different open-source models, datasets of varying difficulty levels, and decoding strategies. Specifically, we explore how false positives influence the inference time scaling behavior of language models. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) false positive solutions persist across different models, datasets, and decoding methods, (2) sampling-based inference time scaling methods do not alleviate the problem, and (3) the pass@N evaluation metric is more susceptible to false positives, suggesting a significantly lower scaling ceiling than what automatic evaluations indicate. Additionally, we analyze specific instances of false positives and discuss potential limitations in self-improvement techniques and synthetic data generation under such conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Taubenfeld, Tom Sheffer, Eran Ofek, Amir Feder, Ariel Goldstein, Zorik Gekhman, Gal Yona</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency decoding enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by sampling diverse reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer. However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbing Guo, Yichi Zhang, Zhongpu Bo, Zhuo Chen, Mengshu Sun, Zhiqiang Zhang, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Typically, LLMs are trained to predict the next token, aligning well with many NLP tasks. However, in knowledge graph (KG) scenarios, entities are the fundamental units and identifying an entity requires at least several tokens. This leads to a granularity mismatch between KGs and natural languages. To address this issue, we propose K-ON, which integrates KG knowledge into the LLM by employing multiple head layers for next k-step prediction. K-ON can not only generate entity-level results in one step, but also enables contrastive loss against entities, which is the most powerful tool in KG representation learning. Experimental results show that K-ON outperforms state-of-the-art methods that incorporate text and even the other modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichen Dong, Zhanhui Zhou, Zhixuan Liu, Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we argue that large language models (LLMs), though trained to predict only the next token, exhibit emergent planning behaviors: $\textbf{their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond the next token}$. Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structural attributes}$ (response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavioral attributes}$ (answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggests potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utkarsh Tiwari, Aryan Seth, Adi Mukherjee, Kaavya Mer,  Kavish, Dhruv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DebateBench, a novel dataset consisting of an extensive collection of transcripts and metadata from some of the world's most prestigious competitive debates. The dataset consists of British Parliamentary debates from prestigious debating tournaments on diverse topics, annotated with detailed speech-level scores and house rankings sourced from official adjudication data. We curate 256 speeches across 32 debates with each debate being over 1 hour long with each input being an average of 32,000 tokens. Designed to capture long-context, large-scale reasoning tasks, DebateBench provides a benchmark for evaluating modern large language models (LLMs) on their ability to engage in argumentation, deliberation, and alignment with human experts. To do well on DebateBench, the LLMs must perform in-context learning to understand the rules and evaluation criteria of the debates, then analyze 8 seven minute long speeches and reason about the arguments presented by all speakers to give the final results. Our preliminary evaluation using GPT o1, GPT-4o, and Claude Haiku, shows that LLMs struggle to perform well on DebateBench, highlighting the need to develop more sophisticated techniques for improving their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Yixing Xu, Jinze Li, Yang Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju Ren, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by using a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the larger target model. However, the limited capacity of the draft model often necessitates tree-based sampling to improve prediction accuracy, where multiple candidates are generated at each step. We identify a key limitation in this approach: the candidates at the same step are derived from the same representation, limiting diversity and reducing overall effectiveness. To address this, we propose Jakiro, leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE), where independent experts generate diverse predictions, effectively decoupling correlations among candidates. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid inference strategy, combining autoregressive decoding for initial tokens with parallel decoding for subsequent stages, and enhance the latter with contrastive mechanism in features to improve accuracy. Our method significantly boosts prediction accuracy and achieves higher inference speedups. Extensive experiments across diverse models validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, establishing a new SOTA in speculative decoding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqun Liu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiahao Ying, Mahani Aljunied, Anh Tuan Luu, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces two novel benchmarks, SeaExam and SeaBench, designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian (SEA) application scenarios. Unlike existing multilingual datasets primarily derived from English translations, these benchmarks are constructed based on real-world scenarios from SEA regions. SeaExam draws from regional educational exams to form a comprehensive dataset that encompasses subjects such as local history and literature. In contrast, SeaBench is crafted around multi-turn, open-ended tasks that reflect daily interactions within SEA communities. Our evaluations demonstrate that SeaExam and SeaBench more effectively discern LLM performance on SEA language tasks compared to their translated benchmarks. This highlights the importance of using real-world queries to assess the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricia Porretta, Sylvester Pakenham, Huxley Ainsworth, Gregory Chatten, Godfrey Allerton, Simon Hollingsworth, Vance Periwinkle</p>
<p>Abstract: Token prediction stability remains a challenge in autoregressive generative models, where minor variations in early inference steps often lead to significant semantic drift over extended sequences. A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayato Ikoma, Teruko Mitamura</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the novelty of patent claims is a critical yet challenging task traditionally performed by patent examiners. While advancements in NLP have enabled progress in various patent-related tasks, novelty assessment remains unexplored. This paper introduces a novel challenge by evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to assess patent novelty by comparing claims with cited prior art documents, following the process similar to that of patent examiners done. We present the first dataset specifically designed for novelty evaluation, derived from real patent examination cases, and analyze the capabilities of LLMs to address this task. Our study reveals that while classification models struggle to effectively assess novelty, generative models make predictions with a reasonable level of accuracy, and their explanations are accurate enough to understand the relationship between the target patent and prior art. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist in patent evaluation, reducing the workload for both examiners and applicants. Our contributions highlight the limitations of current models and provide a foundation for improving AI-driven patent analysis through advanced models and refined datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Kamble, Melisa Russak, Dmytro Mozolevskyi, Muayad Ali, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new long-context financial benchmark, FailSafeQA, designed to test the robustness and context-awareness of LLMs against six variations in human-interface interactions in LLM-based query-answer systems within finance. We concentrate on two case studies: Query Failure and Context Failure. In the Query Failure scenario, we perturb the original query to vary in domain expertise, completeness, and linguistic accuracy. In the Context Failure case, we simulate the uploads of degraded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We employ the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained rating criteria to define and calculate Robustness, Context Grounding, and Compliance scores for 24 off-the-shelf models. The results suggest that although some models excel at mitigating input perturbations, they must balance robust answering with the ability to refrain from hallucinating. Notably, Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct, recognized as the most compliant model, maintained strong baseline performance but encountered challenges in sustaining robust predictions in 17% of test cases. On the other hand, the most robust model, OpenAI o3-mini, fabricated information in 41% of tested cases. The results demonstrate that even high-performing models have significant room for improvement and highlight the role of FailSafeQA as a tool for developing LLMs optimized for dependability in financial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho</p>
<p>Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the preferred 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it can be well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable. When parsimony and generalizability are prioritized, we find strong support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. This finding suggests that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.</p>

The data was sourced from different toxicity evaluation datasets and then rewritten with nine modern open-source LLMs in few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on the produced synthetic datasets have superior performance to those trained on the human-annotated MultiParaDetox dataset even in data limited setting. Models trained on SynthDetoxM outperform all evaluated LLMs in few-shot setting. We release our dataset and code to help further research in multilingual text detoxification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi An, Xu Zhao, Tao Yu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Outliers have been widely observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly impacting model performance and posing challenges for model compression. Understanding the functionality and formation mechanisms of these outliers is critically important. Existing works, however, largely focus on reducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an in-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of outliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers-activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers-and analyze their distributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections between their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention mechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the mechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through theoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the self-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit context-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers stem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study not only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows that structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve model compression.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katharina H\"ammerl, Tomasz Limisiewicz, Jind\v{r}ich Libovick\'y, Alexander Fraser</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work has considered token overlap, or even similarity of token distributions, as predictors for multilinguality and cross-lingual knowledge transfer in language models. However, these very literal metrics assign large distances to language pairs with different scripts, which can nevertheless show good cross-linguality. This limits the explanatory strength of token overlap for knowledge transfer between language pairs that use distinct scripts or follow different orthographic conventions. In this paper, we propose subword token alignability as a new way to understand the impact and quality of multilingual tokenisation. In particular, this metric predicts multilinguality much better when scripts are disparate and the overlap of literal tokens is low. We analyse this metric in the context of both encoder and decoder models, look at data size as a potential distractor, and discuss how this insight may be applied to multilingual tokenisation in future work. We recommend our subword token alignability metric for identifying optimal language pairs for cross-lingual transfer, as well as to guide the construction of better multilingual tokenisers in the future. We publish our code and reproducibility details.</p>

This paper presents KARMA, a novel framework employing multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to automate KG enrichment through structured analysis of unstructured text. Our approach employs nine collaborative agents, spanning entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution that iteratively parse documents, verify extracted knowledge, and integrate it into existing graph structures while adhering to domain-specific schema. Experiments on 1,200 PubMed articles from three different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KARMA in knowledge graph enrichment, with the identification of up to 38,230 new entities while achieving 83.1\% LLM-verified correctness and reducing conflict edges by 18.6\% through multi-layer assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Splieth\"over, Tim Knebler, Fabian Fumagalli, Maximilian Muschalik, Barbara Hammer, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Henning Wachsmuth</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances on instruction fine-tuning have led to the development of various prompting techniques for large language models, such as explicit reasoning steps. However, the success of techniques depends on various parameters, such as the task, language model, and context provided. Finding an effective prompt is, therefore, often a trial-and-error process. Most existing approaches to automatic prompting aim to optimize individual techniques instead of compositions of techniques and their dependence on the input. To fill this gap, we propose an adaptive prompting approach that predicts the optimal prompt composition ad-hoc for a given input. We apply our approach to social bias detection, a highly context-dependent task that requires semantic understanding. We evaluate it with three large language models on three datasets, comparing compositions to individual techniques and other baselines. The results underline the importance of finding an effective prompt composition. Our approach robustly ensures high detection performance, and is best in several settings. Moreover, first experiments on other tasks support its generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in human-guided conversations such as instruction following and question answering, the potential of LLM-guided conversations-where LLMs direct the discourse and steer the conversation's objectives-remains under-explored. In this study, we first characterize LLM-guided conversation into three fundamental components: (i) Goal Navigation; (ii) Context Management; (iii) Empathetic Engagement, and propose GuideLLM as an installation. We then implement an interviewing environment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation. Specifically, various topics are involved in this environment for comprehensive interviewing evaluation, resulting in around 1.4k turns of utterances, 184k tokens, and over 200 events mentioned during the interviewing for each chatbot evaluation. We compare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and autobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user proxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM behaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human participants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines. We then collect human feedback, preferences, and ratings regarding the qualities of conversation and autobiography. Experimental results indicate that GuideLLM significantly outperforms baseline LLMs in automatic evaluation and achieves consistent leading performances in human ratings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean Vassoyan, Nathana\"el Beau, Roman Plaud</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to achieve long-term goals is a key challenge in the current development of large language models (LLMs). To address this, pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore solutions that optimize a given goal. However, exploration with LLMs is difficult, as a balance has to be struck between discovering new solutions and staying close enough to the pre-trained model, so as not to degrade basic capabilities. This is typically controlled with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty. In this paper, we investigate the exploration dynamics of a small language model on a simple arithmetic task. We show how varying degrees of pre-training influence exploration and demonstrate the importance of "critical tokens" which have a dramatic impact on the final outcome. Consequently, we introduce a simple modification to the KL penalty that favors exploration on critical tokens, increasing the efficiency of the RL fine-tuning stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores strategies for efficiently classifying scientific full texts using both small, BERT-based models and local large language models like Llama-3.1 8B. We focus on developing methods for selecting subsets of input sentences to reduce input size while simultaneously enhancing classification performance. To this end, we compile a novel dataset consisting of full-text scientific papers from the field of invasion biology, specifically addressing the impacts of invasive species. These papers are aligned with publicly available impact assessments created by researchers for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that various sources like human evidence annotations, LLM-generated annotations or explainability scores can be used to train sentence selection models that improve the performance of both encoder- and decoder-based language models while optimizing efficiency through the reduction in input length, leading to improved results even if compared to models like ModernBERT that are able to handle the complete text as input. Additionally, we find that repeated sampling of shorter inputs proves to be a very effective strategy that, at a slightly increased cost, can further improve classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent surge in high-quality open-sourced Generative AI text models (colloquially: LLMs), as well as efficient finetuning techniques, has opened the possibility of creating high-quality personalized models, i.e., models generating text attuned to a specific individual's needs and capable of credibly imitating their writing style by leveraging that person's own data to refine an open-source model. The technology to create such models is accessible to private individuals, and training and running such models can be done cheaply on consumer-grade hardware. These advancements are a huge gain for usability and privacy. This position paper argues, however, that these advancements also introduce new safety risks by making it practically feasible for malicious actors to impersonate specific individuals at scale, for instance for the purpose of phishing emails, based on small amounts of publicly available text. We further argue that these risks are complementary to - and distinct from - the much-discussed risks of other impersonation attacks such as image, voice, or video deepfakes, and are not adequately addressed by the larger research community, or the current generation of open - and closed-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengwen Qi, Ren Ma, Bowen Li, He Du, Binyuan Hui, Jinwang Wu, Yuanjun Laili, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: First-order logic (FOL) reasoning, which involves sequential deduction, is pivotal for intelligent systems and serves as a valuable task for evaluating reasoning capabilities, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) contexts. Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhou, Kun-Yang Yu, Shi-Yu Tian, Jiang-Xin Shi, Xiao-Wen Yang, Pengxiao Song, Yi-Xuan Jin, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), both proprietary and open-source, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning. Our framework enables leveraging legal knowledge to enhance generation diversity and introduces a refinement and verification process to ensure the quality of generated data. Moreover, we expand the generated dataset to further enhance the LLM reasoning capabilities. Using KgDG, we create a synthetic legal reasoning dataset containing 50K high-quality examples. Our trained model LawGPT outperforms existing legal-specific LLMs and achieves performance comparable to proprietary LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of KgDG and LawGPT. Our code and resources is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KgDG-45F5 .</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the scarcity of agent-oriented pre-training data, LLM-based autonomous agents typically rely on complex prompting or extensive fine-tuning, which often fails to introduce new capabilities while preserving strong generalizability. We introduce Hephaestus-Forge, the first large-scale pre-training corpus designed to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents in API function calling, intrinsic reasoning and planning, and adapting to environmental feedback. Hephaestus-Forge comprises 103B agent-specific data encompassing 76,537 APIs, including both tool documentation to introduce knowledge of API functions and function calling trajectories to strengthen intrinsic reasoning. To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gon\c{c}alo Gomes, Chrysoula Zerva, Bruno Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of image captions, looking at both linguistic fluency and semantic correspondence to visual contents, has witnessed a significant effort. Still, despite advancements such as the CLIPScore metric, multilingual captioning evaluation has remained relatively unexplored. This work presents several strategies, and extensive experiments, related to evaluating CLIPScore variants in multilingual settings. To address the lack of multilingual test data, we consider two different strategies: (1) using quality aware machine-translated datasets with human judgements, and (2) re-purposing multilingual datasets that target semantic inference and reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of finetuned multilingual models to generalize across languages and to handle complex linguistic challenges. Tests with machine-translated data show that multilingual CLIPScore models can maintain a high correlation with human judgements across different languages, and additional tests with natively multilingual and multicultural data further attest to the high-quality assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Ru, Yuxin Xie, Xianwei Zhuang, Yuguo Yin, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Web-scale pre-training datasets are the cornerstone of LLMs' success. However, text data curated from the internet inevitably contains random noise caused by decoding errors or unregulated web content. In contrast to previous works that focus on low quality or synthetic data, our study \textbf{provides the first systematic investigation into such random noise through a cohesive ``What-Why-How'' framework.} Surprisingly, we observed that the resulting increase in next-token prediction (NTP) loss was significantly lower than the proportion of random noise. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon, which also elucidates the success of multilingual models. On the other hand, experiments show that the model's performance in downstream tasks is not based solely on the NTP loss, which means that random noise may result in degraded downstream performance. To address the potential adverse effects, we introduce a novel plug-and-play Local Gradient Matching loss, which explicitly enhances the denoising capability of the downstream task head by aligning the gradient of normal and perturbed features without requiring knowledge of the model's parameters. Additional experiments on 8 language and 14 vision benchmarks further validate its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adithya Pratapa, Teruko Mitamura</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically summarizing large text collections is a valuable tool for document research, with applications in journalism, academic research, legal work, and many other fields. In this work, we contrast two classes of systems for large-scale multi-document summarization (MDS): compression and full-text. Compression-based methods use a multi-stage pipeline and often lead to lossy summaries. Full-text methods promise a lossless summary by relying on recent advances in long-context reasoning. To understand their utility on large-scale MDS, we evaluated them on three datasets, each containing approximately one hundred documents per summary. Our experiments cover a diverse set of long-context transformers (Llama-3.1, Command-R, Jamba-1.5-Mini) and compression methods (retrieval-augmented, hierarchical, incremental). Overall, we find that full-text and retrieval methods perform the best in most settings. With further analysis into the salient information retention patterns, we show that compression-based methods show strong promise at intermediate stages, even outperforming full-context. However, they suffer information loss due to their multi-stage pipeline and lack of global context. Our results highlight the need to develop hybrid approaches that combine compression and full-text approaches for optimal performance on large-scale multi-document summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingshui Gu, Shu Li, Tianyu Zheng, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Steel-LLM is a Chinese-centric language model developed from scratch with the goal of creating a high-quality, open-source model despite limited computational resources. Launched in March 2024, the project aimed to train a 1-billion-parameter model on a large-scale dataset, prioritizing transparency and the sharing of practical insights to assist others in the community. The training process primarily focused on Chinese data, with a small proportion of English data included, addressing gaps in existing open-source LLMs by providing a more detailed and practical account of the model-building journey. Steel-LLM has demonstrated competitive performance on benchmarks such as CEVAL and CMMLU, outperforming early models from larger institutions. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of the project's key contributions, including data collection, model design, training methodologies, and the challenges encountered along the way, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners looking to develop their own LLMs. The model checkpoints and training script are available at https://github.com/zhanshijinwat/Steel-LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Leschanowsky, Zahra Kolagar, Erion \c{C}ano, Ivan Habernal, Dara Hallinan, Emanu\"el A. P. Habets, Birgit Popp</p>
<p>Abstract: The transparency principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data processing information to be clear, precise, and accessible. While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility.
  This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations.
  Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephanie Schoch, Yangfeng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities to learn in-context, where exemplar input-output pairings are appended to the prompt for demonstration. However, existing work has demonstrated the ability of models to learn lexical and label biases in-context, which negatively impacts both performance and robustness of models. The impact of other statistical data biases remains under-explored, which this work aims to address. We specifically investigate the impact of length biases on in-context learning. We demonstrate that models do learn length biases in the context window for their predictions, and further empirically analyze the factors that modulate the level of bias exhibited by the model. In addition, we show that learning length information in-context can be used to counter the length bias that has been encoded in models (e.g., via fine-tuning). This reveals the power of in-context learning in debiasing model prediction behaviors without the need for costly parameter updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somin Wadhwa, Chantal Shaib, Silvio Amir, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Model distillation -- using outputs from a large teacher model to teach a small student model -- is a practical means of creating efficient models for a particular task. We ask: Can we identify a students' teacher based on its outputs? Such "footprints" left by teacher LLMs would be interesting artifacts. Beyond this, reliable teacher inference may have practical implications as actors seek to distill specific capabilities of massive proprietary LLMs into deployed smaller LMs, potentially violating terms of service. We consider practical task distillation targets including summarization, question answering, and instruction-following. We assume a finite set of candidate teacher models, which we treat as blackboxes. We design discriminative models that operate over lexical features. We find that $n$-gram similarity alone is unreliable for identifying teachers, but part-of-speech (PoS) templates preferred by student models mimic those of their teachers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) benchmarks are often based on open-ended or close-ended QA evaluations, avoiding the requirement of human labor. Close-ended measurements evaluate the factuality of responses but lack expressiveness. Open-ended capture the model's capacity to produce discourse responses but are harder to assess for correctness. These two approaches are commonly used, either independently or together, though their relationship remains poorly understood. This work is focused on the healthcare domain, where both factuality and discourse matter greatly. It introduces a comprehensive, multi-axis suite for healthcare LLM evaluation, exploring correlations between open and close benchmarks and metrics. Findings include blind spots and overlaps in current methodologies. As an updated sanity check, we release a new medical benchmark--CareQA--, with both open and closed variants. Finally, we propose a novel metric for open-ended evaluations --Relaxed Perplexity-- to mitigate the identified limitations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06669">Boosting Self-Efficacy and Performance of Large Language Models via Verbal Efficacy Stimulations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Chen, Tailai Peng, Xinran Xie, Dekun Lin, Zhe Cui, Zheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant improvements have been observed in the zero-shot capabilities of the Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to their high sensitivity to input, research has increasingly focused on enhancing LLMs' performance via direct and simple prompt engineering rather than intricate domain adaptation. Studies suggest that LLMs exhibit emotional intelligence, and both positive and negative emotions can potentially enhance task performances. However, prior interaction prompts have predominantly concentrated on a single stimulus type, neglecting to compare different stimulus effects, examine the influence of varying task difficulties, or explore underlying mechanisms. This paper, inspired by the positive correlation between self-efficacy and task performance within the social cognitive theory, introduces Verbal Efficacy Stimulations (VES). Our VES comprises three types of verbal prompts: encouraging, provocative, and critical, addressing six aspects such as helpfulness and competence. And we further categorize task difficulty, aiming to extensively investigate how distinct VES influence the self-efficacy and task achievements of language models at varied levels of difficulty. The experimental results show that the three types of VES improve the performance of LLMs on most tasks, and the most effective VES varies for different models. In extensive experiments, we have obtained some findings consistent with psychological theories, providing novel insights for future research.</p>

We present the Scandinavian Language Identification and Evaluation, SLIDE, a manually curated multi-label evaluation dataset and a suite of LID models with varying speed-accuracy tradeoffs. We demonstrate that the ability to identify multiple languages simultaneously is necessary for any accurate LID method, and present a novel approach to training such multi-label LID models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Liu, Junqi Gao, Jian Zhao, Kaiyan Zhang, Xiu Li, Biqing Qi, Wanli Ouyang, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Synk, Monte Hoover, John Kirchenbauer, Neel Jain, Alex Stein, Manli Shu, Josue Melendez Sanchez, Ramani Duraiswami, Tom Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: There is growing demand for performing inference with hundreds of thousands of input tokens on trained transformer models. Inference at this extreme scale demands significant computational resources, hindering the application of transformers at long contexts on commodity (i.e not data center scale) hardware. To address the inference time costs associated with running self-attention based transformer language models on long contexts and enable their adoption on widely available hardware, we propose a tunable mechanism that reduces the cost of the forward pass by attending to only the most relevant tokens at every generation step using a top-k selection mechanism. We showcase the efficiency gains afforded by our method by performing inference on context windows up to 1M tokens using approximately 16GB of GPU RAM. Our experiments reveal that models are capable of handling the sparsity induced by the reduced number of keys and values. By attending to less than 2% of input tokens, we achieve over 95% of model performance on common long context benchmarks (LM-Eval, AlpacaEval, and RULER).</p>

<p>Abstract: We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Reasoning abilities, especially those for solving complex math problems, are crucial components of general intelligence. Recent advances by proprietary companies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on reasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and the techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement learning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts. This paper proposes a new RL framework, termed OREAL, to pursue the performance limit that can be achieved through \textbf{O}utcome \textbf{RE}w\textbf{A}rd-based reinforcement \textbf{L}earning for mathematical reasoning tasks, where only binary outcome rewards are easily accessible. We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on positive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the KL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation further implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to ensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To alleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which are even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought for reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample important tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the first time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL, being on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models trained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500. Our investigation also indicates the importance of initial policy models and training queries for RL. Code, models, and data will be released to benefit future research\footnote{https://github.com/InternLM/OREAL}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Xinyu Lu, Junjie Yang, Yanjiang Liu, Yaojie Lu, Debing Zhang,  XingYu</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.</p>

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buyun Liang, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Darshan Thaker, Jinqi Luo, Ren\'e Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks exploit specific prompts to bypass LLM safeguards, causing the LLM to generate harmful, inappropriate, and misaligned content. Current jailbreaking methods rely heavily on carefully designed system prompts and numerous queries to achieve a single successful attack, which is costly and impractical for large-scale red-teaming. To address this challenge, we propose to distill the knowledge of an ensemble of SOTA attackers into a single open-source model, called Knowledge-Distilled Attacker (KDA), which is finetuned to automatically generate coherent and diverse attack prompts without the need for meticulous system prompt engineering. Compared to existing attackers, KDA achieves higher attack success rates and greater cost-time efficiency when targeting multiple SOTA open-source and commercial black-box LLMs. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative diversity analysis of prompts generated by baseline methods and KDA, identifying diverse and ensemble attacks as key factors behind KDA's effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Leong Su Yean, Neha Sunkara, Sanjiban Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective asynchronous planning, or the ability to efficiently reason and plan over states and actions that must happen in parallel or sequentially, is essential for agents that must account for time delays, reason over diverse long-horizon tasks, and collaborate with other agents. While large language model (LLM) agents show promise in high-level task planning, current benchmarks focus primarily on short-horizon tasks and do not evaluate such asynchronous planning capabilities. We introduce Robotouille, a challenging benchmark environment designed to test LLM agents' ability to handle long-horizon asynchronous scenarios. Our synchronous and asynchronous datasets capture increasingly complex planning challenges that go beyond existing benchmarks, requiring agents to manage overlapping tasks and interruptions. Our results show that ReAct (gpt4-o) achieves 47% on synchronous tasks but only 11% on asynchronous tasks, highlighting significant room for improvement. We further analyze failure modes, demonstrating the need for LLM agents to better incorporate long-horizon feedback and self-audit their reasoning during task execution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihua Du, Yiming Yang, Sean Welleck</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of temperature's role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Anil Ramakrishna, Mingyi Hong, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Al-Lawati, Jason Lucas, Zhiwei Zhang, Prasenjit Mitra, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) effectively conditions large language models (LLMs) for molecular tasks, such as property prediction and molecule captioning, by embedding carefully selected demonstration examples into the input prompt. This approach avoids the computational overhead of extensive pertaining and fine-tuning. However, current prompt retrieval methods for molecular tasks have relied on molecule feature similarity, such as Morgan fingerprints, which do not adequately capture the global molecular and atom-binding relationships. As a result, these methods fail to represent the full complexity of molecular structures during inference. Moreover, small-to-medium-sized LLMs, which offer simpler deployment requirements in specialized systems, have remained largely unexplored in the molecular ICL literature. To address these gaps, we propose a self-supervised learning technique, GAMIC (Graph-Aligned Molecular In-Context learning, which aligns global molecular structures, represented by graph neural networks (GNNs), with textual captions (descriptions) while leveraging local feature similarity through Morgan fingerprints. In addition, we introduce a Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) based diversity heuristic during retrieval to optimize input prompt demonstration samples. Our experimental findings using diverse benchmark datasets show GAMIC outperforms simple Morgan-based ICL retrieval methods across all tasks by up to 45%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Wang, Lingxiao Li, Yifan Tang, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) use advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to significantly improve traffic flow management efficiency, and promote the intelligent development of the transportation industry. However, if the data in ITS is attacked, such as tampering or forgery, it will endanger public safety and cause social losses. Therefore, this paper proposes a watermarking that can verify the integrity of copyright in response to the needs of ITS, termed ITSmark. ITSmark focuses on functions such as extracting watermarks, verifying permission, and tracing tampered locations. The scheme uses the copyright information to build the multi-bit space and divides this space into multiple segments. These segments will be assigned to tokens. Thus, the next token is determined by its segment which contains the copyright. In this way, the obtained data contains the custom watermark. To ensure the authorization, key parameters are encrypted during copyright embedding to obtain cipher data. Only by possessing the correct cipher data and private key, can the user entirely extract the watermark. Experiments show that ITSmark surpasses baseline performances in data quality, extraction accuracy, and unforgeability. It also shows unique capabilities of permission verification and tampered location tracing, which ensures the security of extraction and the reliability of copyright verification. Furthermore, ITSmark can also customize the watermark embedding position and proportion according to user needs, making embedding more flexible.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models has ushered in a new era of agentic systems, where artificial intelligence programs exhibit remarkable autonomous decision-making capabilities across diverse domains. This paper explores agentic system workflows in the financial services industry. In particular, we build agentic crews that can effectively collaborate to perform complex modeling and model risk management (MRM) tasks. The modeling crew consists of a manager and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a manager along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in several objective multimodal reasoning tasks. However, to further enhance their capabilities of empathetic and effective communication with humans, improving how VLMs process and understand emotions is crucial. Despite significant research attention on improving affective understanding, there is a lack of detailed evaluations of VLMs for emotion-related tasks, which can potentially help inform downstream fine-tuning efforts. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLMs for recognizing evoked emotions from images. We create a benchmark for the task of evoked emotion recognition and study the performance of VLMs for this task, from perspectives of correctness and robustness. Through several experiments, we demonstrate important factors that emotion recognition performance depends on, and also characterize the various errors made by VLMs in the process. Finally, we pinpoint potential causes for errors through a human evaluation study. We use our experimental results to inform recommendations for the future of emotion research in the context of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Evans, Stephen Baker, Miles Reed</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked their potential for multimodal tasks, where text and visual data are processed jointly. However, applying LLMs to medical imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXR), poses significant challenges due to the need for precise visual-textual alignment and the preservation of critical diagnostic details. In this paper, we propose Multi-Stage Adaptive Vision-Language Tuning (MAViLT), a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation for CXR understanding. MAViLT incorporates a clinical gradient-weighted tokenization process and a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, enabling it to generate accurate radiology reports, synthesize realistic CXRs from text, and answer vision-based clinical questions. We evaluate MAViLT on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Indiana University CXR, achieving state-of-the-art results across all tasks. Human evaluations further validate the clinical relevance and utility of MAViLT, making it a robust tool for real-world medical applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for multimodal medical imaging while addressing key challenges in vision-language integration.</p>

In this paper, we replace the fixed tree attention with dynamic tree attention on multiple head decoding, specifically in the context of MEDUSA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabin Tang, Tianyu Fan, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce MetaChain-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, MetaChain comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, MetaChain also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate MetaChain's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, MetaChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Bethune, David Grangier, Dan Busbridge, Eleonora Gualdoni, Marco Cuturi, Pierre Ablin</p>
<p>Abstract: A widespread strategy to obtain a language model that performs well on a target domain is to finetune a pretrained model to perform unsupervised next-token prediction on data from that target domain. Finetuning presents two challenges: (i) if the amount of target data is limited, as in most practical applications, the model will quickly overfit, and (ii) the model will drift away from the original model, forgetting the pretraining data and the generic knowledge that comes with it. We aim to derive scaling laws that quantify these two phenomena for various target domains, amounts of available target data, and model scales. We measure the efficiency of injecting pretraining data into the finetuning data mixture to avoid forgetting and mitigate overfitting. A key practical takeaway from our study is that injecting as little as 1% of pretraining data in the finetuning data mixture prevents the model from forgetting the pretraining set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bidipta Sarkar, Warren Xia, C. Karen Liu, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings, as it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable settings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and speaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, we improve a model's listening skills by training them to predict information about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously improve a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent behaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard RL.

<p>Abstract: Mental-illness stigma is a persistent social problem, hampering both treatment-seeking and recovery. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to understand it more clearly, but analyzing the relevant data is highly labor-intensive. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to engage participants in conversations; coded those conversations qualitatively with AI assistance; and, based on those coding results, built causal knowledge graphs to decode stigma. The results we obtained from 1,002 participants demonstrate that conversation with our chatbot can elicit rich information about people's attitudes toward depression, while our AI-assisted coding was strongly consistent with human-expert coding. Our novel approach combining large language models (LLMs) and causal knowledge graphs uncovered patterns in individual responses and illustrated the interrelationships of psychological constructs in the dataset as a whole. The paper also discusses these findings' implications for HCI researchers in developing digital interventions, decomposing human psychological constructs, and fostering inclusive attitudes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Sichun Luo, Xiangyu Chen, Haoming Huang, Hanxu Hou, Linqi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommendation systems to enhance user behavior comprehension. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance. However, existing RAG methods rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, limiting the effectiveness of the systems.
  In this paper, we propose Representation learning for retrieval-Augmented Large Language model Recommendation (RALLRec). Specifically, we enhance textual semantics by prompting LLMs to generate more detailed item descriptions, followed by joint representation learning of textual and collaborative semantics, which are extracted by the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. Considering the potential time-varying characteristics of user interest, a simple yet effective reranking method is further introduced to capture the dynamics of user preference. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the evaluation results validated the effectiveness of our method. Code is made public at https://github.com/JianXu95/RALLRec.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static mechanism of a certain behavior, the training dynamics inside a model remain to be explored. In this work, we develop an interpretable method for fine-tuning and reveal the mechanism behind learning. We first propose the concept of node redundancy as an extension of intrinsic dimension and explain the idea behind circuit discovery from a fresh view. Based on the theory, we propose circuit-tuning, a two-stage algorithm that iteratively performs circuit discovery to mask out irrelevant edges and updates the remaining parameters responsible for a specific task. Experiments show that our method not only improves performance on a wide range of tasks but is also scalable while preserving general capabilities. We visualize and analyze the circuits before, during, and after fine-tuning, providing new insights into the self-organization mechanism of a neural network in the learning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-modal tasks, they are prone to generating hallucinatory text responses that do not align with the given visual input, which restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of transformer-based foundation models, extending our analysis to include Visual Autoregressive (VAR) transformers. VAR represents a big step toward generating images using a novel, scalable, coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' framework. These models set a new quality bar, outperforming all previous methods, including Diffusion Transformers, while having state-of-the-art performance for image synthesis tasks. Our primary contributions establish that, for single-head VAR transformers with a single self-attention layer and single interpolation layer, the VAR Transformer is universal. From the statistical perspective, we prove that such simple VAR transformers are universal approximators for any image-to-image Lipschitz functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that flow-based autoregressive transformers inherit similar approximation capabilities. Our results provide important design principles for effective and computationally efficient VAR Transformer strategies that can be used to extend their utility to more sophisticated VAR models in image generation and other related areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanket Jantre, Tianle Wang, Gilchan Park, Kriti Chopra, Nicholas Jeon, Xiaoning Qian, Nathan M. Urban, Byung-Jun Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhou, Martin Weyssow, Ratnadira Widyasari, Ting Zhang, Junda He, Yunbo Lyu, Jianming Chang, Beiqi Zhang, Dan Huang, David Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized in software engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyun Zhao, Hongyi Yuan, Jingjing Liu, Haichao Chen, Huaiyuan Ying, Songchi Zhou, Sheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity retrieval plays a crucial role in the utilization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and is applied across a wide range of clinical practices. However, a comprehensive evaluation of this task is lacking due to the absence of a public benchmark. In this paper, we propose the development and release of a novel benchmark for evaluating entity retrieval in EHRs, with a particular focus on the semantic gap issue. Using discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III dataset, we incorporate ICD codes and prescription labels associated with the notes as queries, and annotate relevance judgments using GPT-4. In total, we use 1,000 patient notes, generate 1,246 queries, and provide over 77,000 relevance annotations. To offer the first assessment of the semantic gap, we introduce a novel classification system for relevance matches. Leveraging GPT-4, we categorize each relevant pair into one of five categories: string, synonym, abbreviation, hyponym, and implication. Using the proposed benchmark, we evaluate several retrieval methods, including BM25, query expansion, and state-of-the-art dense retrievers. Our findings show that BM25 provides a strong baseline but struggles with semantic matches. Query expansion significantly improves performance, though it slightly reduces string match capabilities. Dense retrievers outperform traditional methods, particularly for semantic matches, and general-domain dense retrievers often surpass those trained specifically in the biomedical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Zindulka, Sven Goller, Florian Lehmann, Daniel Buschek</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile emailing demands efficiency in diverse situations, which motivates the use of AI. However, generated text does not always reflect how people want to respond. This challenges users with AI involvement tradeoffs not yet considered in email UIs. We address this with a new UI concept called Content-Driven Local Response (CDLR), inspired by microtasking. This allows users to insert responses into the email by selecting sentences, which additionally serves to guide AI suggestions. The concept supports combining AI for local suggestions and message-level improvements. Our user study (N=126) compared CDLR with manual typing and full reply generation. We found that CDLR supports flexible workflows with varying degrees of AI involvement, while retaining the benefits of reduced typing and errors. This work contributes a new approach to integrating AI capabilities: By redesigning the UI for workflows with and without AI, we can empower users to dynamically adjust AI involvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, which has triggered the discussion of whether the performance is achieved by true reasoning capability or memorization. To investigate this question, prior work has constructed mathematical benchmarks when questions undergo simple perturbations -- modifications that still preserve the underlying reasoning patterns of the solutions. However, no work has explored hard perturbations, which fundamentally change the nature of the problem so that the original solution steps do not apply. To bridge the gap, we construct MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard via simple perturbation and hard perturbation, respectively. Each consists of 279 perturbed math problems derived from level-5 (hardest) problems in the MATH dataset (Hendrycksmath et. al., 2021). We observe significant performance drops on MATH-P-Hard across various models, including o1-mini (-16.49%) and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking (-12.9%). We also raise concerns about a novel form of memorization where models blindly apply learned problem-solving skills without assessing their applicability to modified contexts. This issue is amplified when using original problems for in-context learning. We call for research efforts to address this challenge, which is critical for developing more robust and reliable reasoning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unit test generation has become a promising and important use case of LLMs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for assessing LLM unit test generation capabilities focus on function- or class-level code rather than more practical and challenging project-level codebases. To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant simple errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a dataset of multilingual news articles covering the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. A total of 10,940 news articles were gathered from 1,918 different publishers, covering 1,350 sub-events of the 2021 Olympics, and published between July 1, 2021, and August 14, 2021. These articles are written in nine languages from different language families and in different scripts. To create the dataset, the raw news articles were first retrieved via a service that collects and analyzes news articles. Then, the articles were grouped using an online clustering algorithm, with each group containing articles reporting on the same sub-event. Finally, the groups were manually annotated and evaluated. The development of this dataset aims to provide a resource for evaluating the performance of multilingual news clustering algorithms, for which limited datasets are available. It can also be used to analyze the dynamics and events of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics from different perspectives. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be accessed from the CLARIN.SI repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Ye, Khiem Duc Pham, Xinzhi Zhang, Sivakanth Gopi, Baolin Peng, Beibin Li, Janardhan Kulkarni, Huseyin A. Inan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs. We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs?
  We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency.
  Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</p>

By annotating 86k question-answer pairs over the RICO dataset, we aim to benchmark the screen reading comprehension capacity, thereby laying the foundation for vision-based automation over screenshots. Our annotations encompass full answers, short answer phrases, and corresponding UI contents with bounding boxes, enabling four subtasks to address various application scenarios. We evaluate the dataset's efficacy using both open-weight and proprietary models in zero-shot, fine-tuned, and transfer learning settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Niu, Yun Xiong, Xiaosu Wang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment classification (ASC) aims to judge the sentiment polarity conveyed by the given aspect term in a sentence. The sentiment polarity is not only determined by the local context but also related to the words far away from the given aspect term. Most recent efforts related to the attention-based models can not sufficiently distinguish which words they should pay more attention to in some cases. Meanwhile, graph-based models are coming into ASC to encode syntactic dependency tree information. But these models do not fully leverage syntactic dependency trees as they neglect to incorporate dependency relation tag information into representation learning effectively. In this paper, we address these problems by effectively modeling the local and global features. Firstly, we design a local encoder containing: a Gaussian mask layer and a covariance self-attention layer. The Gaussian mask layer tends to adjust the receptive field around aspect terms adaptively to deemphasize the effects of unrelated words and pay more attention to local information. The covariance self-attention layer can distinguish the attention weights of different words more obviously. Furthermore, we propose a dual-level graph attention network as a global encoder by fully employing dependency tag information to capture long-distance information effectively. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxuan Tan, Qingkai Zeng, Yijun Tian, Zheyuan Liu, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align the LLMs' interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences. Recent advances have highlighted effective prompt design by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these methods faced limitations due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues, and often failed to capture complex, dynamic user behavior patterns. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), employing personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in personal PEFT parameters, users can own and use their LLMs individually. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with non-parametric knowledge from retrieval and profiles, adapting LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Further studies reveal OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different activity levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Li, Jingqian Zhao, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Hui Wang, Xi Zeng, Xingwei Liang, Kam-Fai Wong, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection is critical for understanding the underlying position or attitude expressed toward a topic. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements across various natural language processing tasks including stance detection, however, their performance in stance detection is limited by biases and spurious correlations inherent due to their data-driven nature. Our statistical experiment reveals that LLMs are prone to generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a strong negative correlation between stance bias and stance detection performance, underscoring the importance of mitigating bias to enhance the utility of LLMs in stance detection. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Augmented Calibration Network (FACTUAL), which a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed FACTUAL can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the most important yet onerous tasks in the academic peer-reviewing process is composing meta-reviews, which involves assimilating diverse opinions from multiple expert peers, formulating one's self-judgment as a senior expert, and then summarizing all these perspectives into a concise holistic overview to make an overall recommendation. This process is time-consuming and can be compromised by human factors like fatigue, inconsistency, missing tiny details, etc. Given the latest major developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is very compelling to rigorously study whether LLMs can help metareviewers perform this important task better. In this paper, we perform a case study with three popular LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM2, to assist meta-reviewers in better comprehending multiple experts perspectives by generating a controlled multi-perspective summary (MPS) of their opinions. To achieve this, we prompt three LLMs with different types/levels of prompts based on the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy. Finally, we perform a detailed qualitative study of the MPSs generated by the LLMs and report our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: NLP models today strive for supporting multiple languages and modalities, improving accessibility for diverse users. In this paper, we evaluate their multilingual, multimodal capabilities by testing on a visual reasoning task. We observe that proprietary systems like GPT-4V obtain the best performance on this task now, but open models lag in comparison. Surprisingly, GPT-4V exhibits similar performance between English and other languages, indicating the potential for equitable system development across languages. Our analysis on model failures reveals three key aspects that make this task challenging: multilinguality, complex reasoning, and multimodality. To address these challenges, we propose three targeted interventions including a translate-test approach to tackle multilinguality, a visual programming approach to break down complex reasoning, and a method that leverages image captioning to address multimodality. Our interventions achieve the best open performance on this task in a zero-shot setting, boosting open models LLaVA-v1.5-13B by 13.4%, LLaVA-v1.6-34B by 20.3%, and Qwen-VL by 16.7%, while also minorly improving GPT-4V's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation. This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development in which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) directly convert visual designs into code implementations. In this work, we construct Design2Code - the first real-world benchmark for this task. Specifically, we manually curate 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations to validate the performance ranking. To rigorously benchmark MLLMs, we test various multimodal prompting methods on frontier models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Gemini, and Claude. Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and generating correct layout designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a black-box prompt optimization method that uses an attacker LLM agent to uncover higher levels of memorization in a victim agent, compared to what is revealed by prompting the target model with the training data directly, which is the dominant approach of quantifying memorization in LLMs. We use an iterative rejection-sampling optimization process to find instruction-based prompts with two main characteristics: (1) minimal overlap with the training data to avoid presenting the solution directly to the model, and (2) maximal overlap between the victim model's output and the training data, aiming to induce the victim to spit out training data. We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinheon Baek, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Silviu Cucerzan, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: The pace of scientific research, vital for improving human life, is complex, slow, and needs specialized expertise. Meanwhile, novel, impactful research often stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a cross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields. To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents. Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from shared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers. Then, mimicking a scientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple LLM-based ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via iterative revision processes. These reviewing agents are instantiated with human preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from actual human judgments via LLM prompting. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both human and model-based evaluation results. Our initial foray into AI-mediated scientific research has important implications for the development of future systems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and operationalization of novel work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Michael Alvarez, Jacob Morrier</p>
<p>Abstract: This article proposes a new approach for assessing the quality of answers in political question-and-answer sessions. Our methodology consists of measuring the quality of an answer based on how easily and accurately it can be recognized in a random set of candidate answers given the question's text. This measure reflects the answer's relevance and depth of engagement with the question. Like semantic search, this approach can be implemented by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional human-labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers have a weak semantic connection to questions, suggesting some evasion or obfuscation, answers are generally at least moderately relevant, far surpassing what would be expected from random replies. Our analysis also provides valuable insights into the correlates of answer quality: we find significant correlations with the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions and the topic of the questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Van Nguyen, Dan Quang Tran, Huy Quang Pham, Thang Kien-Bao Nguyen, Nghia Hieu Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a complicated task that requires the capability of simultaneously processing natural language and images. Initially, this task was researched, focusing on methods to help machines understand objects and scene contexts in images. However, some text appearing in the image that carries explicit information about the full content of the image is not mentioned. Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been many studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world. As a developing country, conditions are still limited, and this task is still open in Vietnam. Therefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese specializing in the ability to understand text appearing in images, we call it ViTextVQA (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Text}-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \textbf{over 16,000} images and \textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers. Through meticulous experiments with various state-of-the-art models, we uncover the significance of the order in which tokens in OCR text are processed and selected to formulate answers. This finding helped us significantly improve the performance of the baseline models on the ViTextVQA dataset. Our dataset is available at this \href{https://github.com/minhquan6203/ViTextVQA-Dataset}{link} for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Saeidi, Shivanshu Verma, Md Nayem Uddin, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, testing three configurations: (1) with Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), (2) without SFT, and (3) without SFT but using an instruction tuned model. We further investigate how training set size influences model performance. Our evaluation spans 13 benchmarks covering dialogue, reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, question answering, truthfulness, MT-Bench, Big Bench, and the Open LLM Leaderboard. We find that: (1) alignment methods often achieve near optimal performance even with smaller subsets of training data; (2) although they offer limited improvements on complex reasoning tasks, they enhance mathematical problem-solving; and (3) using an instruction tuned model improves truthfulness. These insights highlight the conditions under which alignment methods excel, as well as their limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong Nhat Vo, Khanh Bao Huynh, Son T. Luu, Trong-Hop Do</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of social networks makes toxic content spread rapidly. Hate speech detection is a task to help decrease the number of harmful comments. With the diversity in the hate speech created by users, it is necessary to interpret the hate speech besides detecting it. Hence, we propose a methodology to construct a system for targeted hate speech detection from online streaming texts from social media. We first introduce the ViTHSD - a targeted hate speech detection dataset for Vietnamese Social Media Texts. The dataset contains 10K comments, each comment is labeled to specific targets with three levels: clean, offensive, and hate. There are 5 targets in the dataset, and each target is labeled with the corresponding level manually by humans with strict annotation guidelines. The inter-annotator agreement obtained from the dataset is 0.45 by Cohen's Kappa index, which is indicated as a moderate level. Then, we construct a baseline for this task by combining the Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN with the pre-trained language model to leverage the power of text representation of BERTology. Finally, we suggest a methodology to integrate the baseline model for targeted hate speech detection into the online streaming system for practical application in preventing hateful and offensive content on social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ifeoluwa Adelani, A. Seza Do\u{g}ru\"oz, Iyanuoluwa Shode, Anuoluwapo Aremu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nigeria is a multilingual country with 500+ languages. Naija is a Nigerian Pidgin spoken by approximately 120M speakers and it is a mixed language (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are some online platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), publishing in written Naija as well. West African Pidgin English (WAPE) is also spoken in Nigeria and it is used by BBC to broadcast news on the internet to a wider audience not only in Nigeria but also in other West African countries (e.g., Cameroon and Ghana). Through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments, our paper shows that these two pidgin varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is underrepresented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples. In addition to the statistical analyses, we also provide historical information on both pidgins as well as insights from the interviews conducted with volunteer Wikipedia contributors in Naija.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, Christin Seifert, J\"org Schl\"otterer</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Carl</p>
<p>Abstract: The article develops a novel generative model of the human translating mind, grounded in empirical translation process data. It posits three embedded processing layers that unfold concurrently in the human mind: sequences of routinized/automated processes are observable in fluent translation production, cognitive/reflective thoughts lead to longer keystroke pauses, while affective/emotional states of the mind may be identified through characteristic patterns of typing and gazing. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data elicits the three assumed hidden mental processing strata. The article relates this embedded generative model to various theoretical frameworks, dual-process theories and Robinson's (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiqin Lin, Andr\'e F. T. Martins, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicate that leveraging off-the-shelf or fine-tuned retrievers, capable of retrieving relevant in-context examples tailored to the input query, enhances few-shot in-context learning of English. However, adapting these methods to other languages, especially low-resource ones, poses challenges due to the scarcity of cross-lingual retrievers and annotated data. Thus, we introduce XAMPLER: Cross-Lingual Example Retrieval, a method tailored to tackle the challenge of cross-lingual in-context learning using only annotated English data. XAMPLER first trains a retriever based on Glot500, a multilingual small language model, using positive and negative English examples constructed from the predictions of a multilingual large language model, i.e., MaLA500. Leveraging the cross-lingual capacity of the retriever, it can directly retrieve English examples as few-shot examples for in-context learning of target languages. Experiments on two multilingual text classification benchmarks, namely SIB200 with 176 languages and MasakhaNEWS with 16 languages, demonstrate that XAMPLER substantially improves the in-context learning performance across languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjia Mao, Dongjun Wei, Zeyu Chen, Xiao Fang, Michael Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the risk of misusing them, raising the need for accurate detection of LLM-generated content. In response, a viable solution is to inject imperceptible identifiers into LLMs, known as watermarks. Our research extends the existing watermarking methods by proposing the novel Sampling One Then Accepting (STA-1) method. STA-1 is an unbiased watermark that preserves the original token distribution in expectation and has a lower risk of producing unsatisfactory outputs in low-entropy scenarios compared to existing unbiased watermarks. In watermark detection, STA-1 does not require prompts or a white-box LLM, provides statistical guarantees, demonstrates high efficiency in detection time, and remains robust against various watermarking attacks. Experimental results on low-entropy and high-entropy datasets demonstrate that STA-1 achieves the above properties simultaneously, making it a desirable solution for watermarking LLMs. Implementation codes for this study are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Li, Gabriel Appleby, Ashley Suh</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LinkQ, a system that leverages a large language model (LLM) to facilitate knowledge graph (KG) query construction through natural language question-answering. Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of a graph querying language, limiting the ability for users -- even experts -- to acquire valuable insights from KGs. LinkQ simplifies this process by implementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's question, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps users iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting both targeted and exploratory analysis. Further, LinkQ guards against the LLM hallucinating outputs by ensuring users' questions are only ever answered from ground truth KG data. We demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ through a qualitative study with five KG practitioners. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted exploratory data analysis systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bairu Hou, Yang Zhang, Jacob Andreas, Shiyu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of hallucination detection, which aims to determine the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. To address this problem, a popular class of methods utilize the LLM's self-consistencies in its beliefs in a set of logically related augmented statements generated by the LLM, which does not require external knowledge databases and can work with both white-box and black-box LLMs. However, in many existing approaches, the augmented statements tend to be very monotone and unstructured, which makes it difficult to integrate meaningful information from the LLM beliefs in these statements. Also, many methods work with the binarized version of the LLM's belief, instead of the continuous version, which significantly loses information. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose Belief Tree Propagation (BTProp), a probabilistic framework for LLM hallucination detection. BTProp introduces a belief tree of logically related statements by recursively decomposing a parent statement into child statements with three decomposition strategies, and builds a hidden Markov tree model to integrate the LLM's belief scores in these statements in a principled way. Experiment results show that our method improves baselines by 3%-9% (evaluated by AUROC and AUC-PR) on multiple hallucination detection benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Crosswords are a form of word puzzle that require a solver to demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in natural language understanding, wordplay, reasoning, and world knowledge, along with adherence to character and length constraints. In this paper we tackle the challenge of solving crosswords with large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that the current generation of language models shows significant competence at deciphering cryptic crossword clues and outperforms previously reported state-of-the-art (SoTA) results by a factor of 2-3 in relevant benchmarks. We also develop a search algorithm that builds off this performance to tackle the problem of solving full crossword grids with out-of-the-box LLMs for the very first time, achieving an accuracy of 93% on New York Times crossword puzzles. Additionally, we demonstrate that LLMs generalize well and are capable of supporting answers with sound rationale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving and impacting various fields, necessitating the development of effective methods to evaluate and compare their performance. Most current approaches for performance evaluation are either based on fixed, domain-specific questions that lack the flexibility required in many real-world applications, or rely on human input, making them unscalable. To address these issues, we propose an automated benchmarking framework based on debates between LLMs, judged by another LLM. This method assesses not only domain knowledge, but also skills such as argumentative reasoning and inconsistency recognition. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs using the debate framework and achieve rankings that align closely with popular rankings based on human input, eliminating the need for costly human crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily applications, it is essential to ensure they operate fairly across diverse user demographics. In this work, we show that LLMs suffer from personalization bias, where their performance is impacted when they are personalized to a user's identity. We quantify personalization bias by evaluating the performance of LLMs along two axes - safety and utility. We measure safety by examining how benign LLM responses are to unsafe prompts with and without personalization. We measure utility by evaluating the LLM's performance on various tasks, including general knowledge, mathematical abilities, programming, and reasoning skills. We find that various LLMs, ranging from open-source models like Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) to API-based ones like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o (Ouyang et al., 2022), exhibit significant variance in performance in terms of safety-utility trade-offs depending on the user's identity. Finally, we discuss several strategies to mitigate personalization bias using preference tuning and prompt-based defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning based on natural language expressions is essential for everyday human tasks. This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Golovanevsky, William Rudman, Vedant Palit, Ritambhara Singh, Carsten Eickhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained community-spanning prominence due to their ability to integrate visual and textual inputs to perform complex tasks. Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahana Ramnath, Kartik Pandey, Elizabeth Boschee, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Authorship Verification (AV) (do two documents have the same author?) is essential in many real-life applications. AV is often used in privacy-sensitive domains that require an offline proprietary model that is deployed on premises, making publicly served online models (APIs) a suboptimal choice. Current offline AV models however have lower downstream utility due to limited accuracy (eg: traditional stylometry AV systems) and lack of accessible post-hoc explanations. In this work, we address the above challenges by developing a trained, offline model CAVE (Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations). CAVE generates free-text AV explanations that are controlled to be (1) accessible (uniform structure that can be decomposed into sub-explanations grounded to relevant linguistic features), and (2) easily verified for explanation-label consistency. We generate silver-standard training data grounded to the desirable linguistic features by a prompt-based method Prompt-CAVE. We then filter the data based on rationale-label consistency using a novel metric Cons-R-L. Finally, we fine-tune a small, offline model (Llama-3-8B) with this data to create our model CAVE. Results on three difficult AV datasets show that CAVE generates high quality explanations (as measured by automatic and human evaluation) as well as competitive task accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating event graphs from long documents is challenging due to the inherent complexity of multiple tasks involved such as detecting events, identifying their relationships, and reconciling unstructured input with structured graphs. Recent studies typically consider all events with equal importance, failing to distinguish salient events crucial for understanding narratives. This paper presents CALLMSAE, a CAscading Large Language Model framework for SAlient Event graph generation, which leverages the capabilities of LLMs and eliminates the need for costly human annotations. We first identify salient events by prompting LLMs to generate summaries, from which salient events are identified. Next, we develop an iterative code refinement prompting strategy to generate event relation graphs, removing hallucinated relations and recovering missing edges. Powered by CALLMSAE, we present \textit{NYT-SEG}, a large-scale automatically annotated event graph dataset which can serve as distant supervision signals. Fine-tuning contextualised graph generation models on \textit{NYT-SEG} outperforms the models trained on CAEVO data. Results on a human-annotated test set show that the proposed method generates salient and more accurate graphs, outperforming competitive baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of exploiting parallel corpora to enhance multilingual large language models, improving performance in both bilingual tasks, e.g., machine translation, and general-purpose tasks, e.g., text classification. Building upon these findings, our comprehensive study aims to identify the most effective strategies for leveraging parallel corpora. We investigate the impact of parallel corpora quality and quantity, training objectives, and model size on the performance of multilingual large language models enhanced with parallel corpora across diverse languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals several key insights: (i) filtering noisy translations is essential for effectively exploiting parallel corpora, while language identification and short sentence filtering have little effect; (ii) even a corpus with just 10K parallel sentences can yield results comparable to those obtained from much larger datasets; (iii) employing only the machine translation objective yields the best results among various training objectives and their combinations; (iv) larger multilingual language models benefit more from parallel corpora than smaller models. Our study offers valuable insights into the optimal utilization of parallel corpora to enhance multilingual large language models, extending the generalizability of previous findings from limited languages and tasks to a broader range of scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) is crucial for enabling applications of symbolic knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to downstream tasks by projecting knowledge facts into vector spaces. Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture present promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified seq2seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, has significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Waheed, Karima Kadaoui, Bhiksha Raj, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation using pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare with and filter low-quality examples, making the process dependent on human labels. Additionally, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. To address this, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best-distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 WER points and are on par with or outperform similar supervised data filtering setups. When scaling the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. Our models are also 25-50% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqi Zhu, Jeffrey M. Rzeszotarski</p>
<p>Abstract: The term Language Models (LMs) as a time-specific collection of models of interest is constantly reinvented, with its referents updated much like the $\textit{Ship of Theseus}$ replaces its parts but remains the same ship in essence. In this paper, we investigate this $\textit{Ship of Language Models}$ problem, wherein scientific evolution takes the form of continuous, implicit retrofits of key existing terms. We seek to initiate a novel perspective of scientific progress, in addition to the more well-studied emergence of new terms. To this end, we construct the data infrastructure based on recent NLP publications. Then, we perform a series of text-based analyses toward a detailed, quantitative understanding of the use of Language Models as a term of art. Our work highlights how systems and theories influence each other in scientific discourse, and we call for attention to the transformation of this Ship that we all are contributing to.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maor Ivgi, Ori Yoran, Jonathan Berant, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as hallucinations and sequence repetitions. We propose to view these behaviors as fallbacks that models exhibit under epistemic uncertainty, and investigate the connection between them. We categorize fallback behaviors - sequence repetitions, degenerate text, and hallucinations - and extensively analyze them in models from the same family that differ by the amount of pretraining tokens, parameter count, or the inclusion of instruction-following training. Our experiments reveal a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors, across all these axes: the more advanced an LLM is (i.e., trained on more tokens, has more parameters, or instruction-tuned), its fallback behavior shifts from sequence repetitions, to degenerate text, and then to hallucinations. Moreover, the same ordering is observed during the generation of a single sequence, even for the best-performing models; as uncertainty increases, models shift from generating hallucinations to producing degenerate text and finally sequence repetitions. Lastly, we demonstrate that while common decoding techniques, such as random sampling, alleviate unwanted behaviors like sequence repetitions, they increase harder-to-detect hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yining Lu, Dixuan Wang, Tianjian Li, Dongwei Jiang, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Meng Jiang, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become increasingly prevalent, it is interesting to consider how ``creative'' these models can be. From cognitive science, creativity consists of at least two key characteristics: \emph{convergent} thinking (purposefulness to achieve a given goal) and \emph{divergent} thinking (adaptability to explore new environments or constraints) \citep{runco2003critical}. In this work, we introduce a framework for quantifying LLM creativity that incorporates the two design ingredients: (1) We introduce DENIAL PROMPTING which pushes LLMs to develop more creative solutions to a given problem by incrementally imposing new constraints on the previous solution, compelling LLMs to adopt new strategies. (2) We define NEOGAUGE, a metric that quantifies both convergent and divergent thinking in the generated creative responses by LLMs. We test the proposed framework on Codeforces problems, which serve as both a natural dataset for coding tasks and a collection of prior human solutions. We quantify NEOGAUGE for various proprietary and open-source models and find that even the most creative model, GPT-4, still falls short of demonstrating human-like creativity. We also experiment with advanced reasoning strategies (MCTS, self-correction, etc.) and observe no significant improvement in creativity. As a by-product of our analysis, we release NEOCODER dataset for reproducing our results on future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Nicolicioiu, Eugenia Iofinova, Andrej Jovanovic, Eldar Kurtic, Mahdi Nikdan, Andrei Panferov, Ilia Markov, Nir Shavit, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use-cases, such as using personal data to fine-tune these models to imitate a user's unique writing style. Two key requirements for such assistants are personalization - in the sense that the assistant should recognizably reflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may justifiably be wary of uploading extremely personal data, such as their email archive, to a third-party service. In this paper, we present a new design and evaluation for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation, which we call Panza. Panza's personalization features are based on a combination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions technique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate that this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to reflect a user's writing style using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g. on a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is the first detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task, and of how different choices of system components--the use of RAG and of different fine-tuning approaches-impact the system's performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that very little data - under 100 email samples - are sufficient to create models that convincingly imitate humans. This finding showcases a previously-unknown attack vector in language models - that access to a small number of writing samples can allow a bad actor to cheaply create generative models that imitate a target's writing style. We are releasing the full Panza code as well as three new email datasets licensed for research use at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding breakthroughs in code generation. Recent work improves code LLMs by training on synthetic data generated by some powerful LLMs, which can be challenging to scale due to the dependence on a teacher model and high generation costs. In this paper, we focus on synthesizing code data at scale and propose a \textbf{Case2Code} task by exploiting the expressiveness and correctness of programs. \textbf{Case2Code} is an inductive inference task that aims to infer underlying code implementations by observing input-output examples or program behaviors, By incorporating LLMs to generate program inputs, and executing the program with these inputs to obtain the program outputs, we can synthesize diverse and high-quality \textbf{Case2Code} data at scale for training and evaluating code LLMs. Experimental results show that case-to-code induction is challenging for current representative LLMs if they are untrained. Models trained with \textbf{Case2Code} improve performance not only on distribution case-to-code induction but also on various coding-generation tasks, demonstrating the great potential of large-scale synthetic data and inductive learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Kuzmin, Neemesh Yadav, Ivan Smirnov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism designed to enhance the overall model quality in terms of prediction performance and fairness, especially in scenarios where retraining the model is impractical. The method draws inspiration from selective classification, where at inference time, predictions with low quality, as indicated by their uncertainty scores, are discarded. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we remove bias from these predictions using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard uncertainty quantification methods. Experiments on text classification datasets with encoder-based classification models demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to reduce the performance gap between post-processing methods and debiasing techniques from the at-training and pre-processing categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Gumma, Pranjal A. Chitale, Kalika Bali</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have traditionally used Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings (PEs), which often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and are inefficient for handling extended context or document-level translation tasks. This work addresses the challenge of transitioning pre-trained NMT models from absolute Sinusoidal PEs to Relative PEs, such as RoPE and ALiBi, without compromising performance. We demonstrate that parameter-efficient fine-tuning, using only a small amount of high-quality data, can successfully facilitate this transition. Experimental results indicate that switching from Sinusoidal to Relative PEs results in competitive translation quality on sentence-level evaluation benchmarks. Additionally, models trained with RoPE consistently outperform those using ALiBi and Sinusoidal PEs on document-level benchmarks across both string-based metrics and qualitative evaluations. Moreover, we find that a small amount of long-context data in a few languages is sufficient for cross-lingual length generalization, thereby inducing long-context capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristina Gligori\'c, Tijana Zrnic, Cinoo Lee, Emmanuel J. Cand\`es, Dan Jurafsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown high agreement with human raters across a variety of tasks, demonstrating potential to ease the challenges of human data collection. In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, but their real-world application necessitates reliable calibration. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of calibration degradation of LLMs across four dimensions: models, calibration metrics, tasks, and confidence extraction methods. Initial analysis showed that the relationship between alignment and calibration is not always a trade-off, but under stricter analysis conditions, we found the alignment process consistently harms calibration. This highlights the need for (1) a careful approach when measuring model confidences and calibration errors and (2) future research into algorithms that can help LLMs to achieve both instruction-following and calibration without sacrificing either.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliakbar Nafar, Kristen Brent Venable, Parisa Kordjamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of being in-context learners. However, the underlying mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) is still a major research question, and experimental research results about how models exploit ICL are not always consistent. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating in-context learning mechanisms, which we claim are a combination of retrieving internal knowledge and learning from in-context examples by focusing on regression tasks. First, we show that LLMs can solve real-world regression problems and then design experiments to measure the extent to which the LLM retrieves its internal knowledge versus learning from in-context examples. We argue that this process lies on a spectrum between these two extremes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the degrees to which these mechanisms are triggered depending on various factors, such as prior knowledge about the tasks and the type and richness of the information provided by the in-context examples. We employ three LLMs and utilize multiple datasets to corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our results shed light on how to engineer prompts to leverage meta-learning from in-context examples and foster knowledge retrieval depending on the problem being addressed.</p>

Our methodology involves three main components: a player model that adopts a specific character role, an interrogator model that simulates user behavior in a specific situation, and a judge model ensemble that evaluates conversation quality with 3 metrics: character consistency, entertainment value, and language fluency. We evaluated more than 40 models in both English and Russian, with each model participating in 64 conversations with 8 characters and 8 situations. We conducted experiments comparing automated evaluations with human annotations to validate our approach, demonstrating strong correlations across multiple criteria. This work provides a foundation for a robust and dynamic evaluation of different model capabilities in interactive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faiz Ali Shah, Ahmed Sabir, Rajesh Sharma, Dietmar Pfahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic analysis of user reviews to understand user sentiments toward app functionality (i.e. app features) helps align development efforts with user expectations and needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on several new tasks without updating the model's parameters i.e. using zero or a few labeled examples, but the capabilities of LLMs are yet unexplored for feature-specific sentiment analysis. The goal of our study is to explore the capabilities of LLMs to perform feature-specific sentiment analysis of user reviews. This study compares the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and different variants of Llama-2 chat, against previous approaches for extracting app features and associated sentiments in zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot scenarios. The results indicate that GPT-4 outperforms the rule-based SAFE by 17% in f1-score for extracting app features in the zero-shot scenario, with 5-shot further improving it by 6%. However, the fine-tuned RE-BERT exceeds GPT-4 by 6% in f1-score. For predicting positive and neutral sentiments, GPT-4 achieves f1-scores of 76% and 45% in the zero-shot setting, which improve by 7% and 23% in the 5-shot setting, respectively. Our study conducts a thorough evaluation of both proprietary and open-source LLMs to provide an objective assessment of their performance in extracting feature-sentiment pairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, visually-rich document understanding has attracted increasing attention. Transformer-based pre-trained models have become the mainstream approach, yielding significant performance gains in this field. However, the self-attention mechanism's quadratic computational complexity hinders their efficiency and ability to process long documents. In this paper, we present DocMamba, a novel framework based on the state space model. It is designed to reduce computational complexity to linear while preserving global modeling capabilities. To further enhance its effectiveness in document processing, we introduce the Segment-First Bidirectional Scan (SFBS) to capture contiguous semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that DocMamba achieves new state-of-the-art results on downstream datasets such as FUNSD, CORD, and SORIE, while significantly improving speed and reducing memory usage. Notably, experiments on the HRDoc confirm DocMamba's potential for length extrapolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathya Krishnan Suresh, Wu Mengjun, Tushar Pranav, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of domain-specific dialogue datasets limits the development of dialogue systems across applications. Existing research is constrained by general or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse conversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data on dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as we increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We open source the code and data generated for future research.</p>

Yet, many directions remain unexplored -- artificially degraded language models, synthetic data, digital twins, and more. We highlight gaps and opportunities around trust, scientific rigor, applicability and cross-community collaboration. We raise ethical dilemmas in the field, and highlight the diverse datasets encountered throughout our review -- recorded, written, structured, spontaneous, synthetic, clinical, social media-based, and more.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to be predictable and trustworthy to support reliable decision-making systems. Yet current LLMs often show inconsistencies in their judgments. In this work, we examine logical preference consistency as a foundational requirement for building more dependable LLM systems, ensuring stable and coherent decision-making while minimizing erratic or contradictory outputs. To quantify the logical preference consistency, we propose a universal evaluation framework based on three fundamental properties: transitivity, commutativity and negation invariance. Through extensive experimentation across diverse LLMs, we demonstrate that these properties serve as strong indicators of judgment robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a data refinement and augmentation technique, REPAIR, that enhances logical consistency while maintaining alignment with human preferences. Finally, we show that improving consistency leads to better performance in LLM-driven logic-based algorithms, reinforcing stability and coherence in decision-making systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decoding and expressing brain activity in a comprehensible form is a challenging frontier in AI. This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost "thoughts-to-text" technology with potential applications in both neuroscience and natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guorui Zheng, Xidong Wang, Juhao Liang, Nuo Chen, Yuping Zheng, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting medical Large Language Models to local languages can reduce barriers to accessing healthcare services, but data scarcity remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaonan Jing, Srinivas Billa, Danny Godbout</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination has been a popular topic in natural language generation (NLG). In real-world applications, unfaithful content can result in poor data quality or loss of trust from end users. Thus, it is crucial to fact-check before adopting NLG for production usage, which can be expensive if done manually. In this paper, we investigate automated faithfulness evaluation in guided NLG. We developed a rubric template and used large language models (LLMs) to score the generation on quantifiable scales. We compared popular LLMs as well as widely adopted natural language inference (NLI) models in scoring quality and sensitivity. In addition, we developed methods for the generation of synthetic unfaithful data, as well as heuristics to quantify the percentage of hallucination. Our results on 4 travel-domain industry dataset show that GPT-4 can provide accurate judgement and explanation of whether a source and a generation are factually consistent. Furthermore, we found that tuning NLI models on synthetic data can improve performance. Lastly, we present insights on the latency and cost of deploying such a system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajay Patel, Jiacheng Zhu, Justin Qiu, Zachary Horvitz, Marianna Apidianaki, Kathleen McKeown, Chris Callison-Burch</p>
<p>Abstract: Style representations aim to embed texts with similar writing styles closely and texts with different styles far apart, regardless of content. However, the contrastive triplets often used for training these representations may vary in both style and content, leading to potential content leakage in the representations. We introduce StyleDistance, a novel approach to training stronger content-independent style embeddings. We use a large language model to create a synthetic dataset of near-exact paraphrases with controlled style variations, and produce positive and negative examples across 40 distinct style features for precise contrastive learning. We assess the quality of our synthetic data and embeddings through human and automatic evaluations. StyleDistance enhances the content-independence of style embeddings, which generalize to real-world benchmarks and outperform leading style representations in downstream applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianyang Zhan, Agam Goyal, Yilun Chen, Eshwar Chandrasekharan, Koustuv Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in many natural language understanding tasks, including content moderation. However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models in both a zero-shot and few-shot setting. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform zero-shot LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. Moreover, few-shot in-context learning leads to only a marginal increase in the performance of LLMs, still lacking compared to SLMs. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques. Finally, we outline directions for future work on language model based content moderation. Code and models can be found at https://github.com/AGoyal0512/SLM-Mod.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghai Yao, Aditya Parashar, Huixue Zhou, Won Seok Jang, Feiyun Ouyang, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic question generation (QG) is essential for AI and NLP, particularly in intelligent tutoring, dialogue systems, and fact verification. Generating multiple-choice questions (MCQG) for professional exams, like the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), is particularly challenging, requiring domain expertise and complex multi-hop reasoning for high-quality questions. However, current large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 struggle with professional MCQG due to outdated knowledge, hallucination issues, and prompt sensitivity, resulting in unsatisfactory quality and difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose MCQG-SRefine, an LLM self-refine-based (Critique and Correction) framework for converting medical cases into high-quality USMLE-style questions. By integrating expert-driven prompt engineering with iterative self-critique and self-correction feedback, MCQG-SRefine significantly enhances human expert satisfaction regarding both the quality and difficulty of the questions. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge-based automatic metric to replace the complex and costly expert evaluation process, ensuring reliable and expert-aligned assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of documents generated by LLMs themselves (Self-Docs) alongside retrieved documents has emerged as a promising strategy for retrieval-augmented generation systems. However, previous research primarily focuses on optimizing the use of Self-Docs, with their inherent properties remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we first investigate the overall effectiveness of Self-Docs, identifying key factors that shape their contribution to RAG performance (RQ1). Building on these insights, we develop a taxonomy grounded in Systemic Functional Linguistics to compare the influence of various Self-Docs categories (RQ2) and explore strategies for combining them with external sources (RQ3). Our findings reveal which types of Self-Docs are most beneficial and offer practical guidelines for leveraging them to achieve significant improvements in knowledge-intensive question answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) utilize numerical attributes encoded in a low-dimensional subspace of the embedding space when answering questions involving numeric comparisons, e.g., Was Cristiano born before Messi? We first identified, using partial least squares regression, these subspaces, which effectively encode the numerical attributes associated with the entities in comparison prompts. Further, we demonstrate causality, by intervening in these subspaces to manipulate hidden states, thereby altering the LLM's comparison outcomes. Experiments conducted on three different LLMs showed that our results hold across different numerical attributes, indicating that LLMs utilize the linearly encoded information for numerical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language Confusion is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text that is neither in the desired language, nor in a contextually appropriate language. This phenomenon presents a critical challenge in text generation by LLMs, often appearing as erratic and unpredictable behavior. We hypothesize that there are linguistic regularities to this inherent vulnerability in LLMs and shed light on patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We introduce a novel metric, Language Confusion Entropy, designed to directly measure and quantify this confusion, based on language distributions informed by linguistic typology and lexical variation. Comprehensive comparisons with the Language Confusion Benchmark (Marchisio et al., 2024) confirm the effectiveness of our metric, revealing patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We further link language confusion to LLM security, and find patterns in the case of multilingual embedding inversion attacks. Our analysis demonstrates that linguistic typology offers theoretically grounded interpretation, and valuable insights into leveraging language similarities as a prior for LLM alignment and security.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in education, concerns about inherent biases in these models have gained prominence. We evaluate LLMs for bias in the personalized educational setting, specifically focusing on the models' roles as "teachers." We reveal significant biases in how models generate and select educational content tailored to different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, disability status, income, and national origin. We introduce and apply two bias score metrics--Mean Absolute Bias (MAB) and Maximum Difference Bias (MDB)--to analyze 9 open and closed state-of-the-art LLMs. Our experiments, which utilize over 17,000 educational explanations across multiple difficulty levels and topics, uncover that models potentially harm student learning by both perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reversing them. We find that bias is similar for all frontier models, with the highest MAB along income levels while MDB is highest relative to both income and disability status. For both metrics, we find the lowest bias exists for sex/gender and race/ethnicity.</p>

Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-chart tasks, neglecting the multi-hop reasoning required to extract and integrate information from multiple charts, which is essential in practical applications. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiChartQA, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in four key areas: direct question answering, parallel question answering, comparative reasoning, and sequential reasoning. Our evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals significant performance gaps compared to humans. These results highlight the challenges in multi-chart comprehension and the potential of MultiChartQA to drive advancements in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magdalena Wysocka, Danilo Carvalho, Oskar Wysocki, Marco Valentino, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Syllogistic reasoning is crucial for Natural Language Inference (NLI). This capability is particularly significant in specialized domains such as biomedicine, where it can support automatic evidence interpretation and scientific discovery. This paper presents SylloBio-NLI, a novel framework that leverages external ontologies to systematically instantiate diverse syllogistic arguments for biomedical NLI. We employ SylloBio-NLI to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on identifying valid conclusions and extracting supporting evidence across 28 syllogistic schemes instantiated with human genome pathways. Extensive experiments reveal that biomedical syllogistic reasoning is particularly challenging for zero-shot LLMs, which achieve an average accuracy between 70% on generalized modus ponens and 23% on disjunctive syllogism. At the same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of different LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%). However, a deeper analysis shows that both techniques exhibit high sensitivity to superficial lexical variations, highlighting a dependency between reliability, models' architecture, and pre-training regime. Overall, our results indicate that, while in-context examples have the potential to elicit syllogistic reasoning in LLMs, existing models are still far from achieving the robustness and consistency required for safe biomedical NLI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to persuasion, which can pose risks when models are faced with an adversarial interlocutor. We take a first step towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing that defense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of the equation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive) persuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for only one side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive and negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Training (or PBT), which leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains models via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT allows us to use data generated from dialogues between smaller 7-8B models for training much larger 70B models. Moreover, PBT consistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to being challenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holistic data containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show that PBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates across two domains (trivia and commonsense QA). We find that without PBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with the order in which the models present their answers determining whether the team obtains the stronger or weaker model's performance. PBT leads to better and more stable results and less order dependence, with the stronger model consistently pulling the weaker one up.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training-free embedding methods directly leverage pretrained large language models (LLMs) to embed text, bypassing the costly and complex procedure of contrastive learning. Previous training-free embedding methods have mainly focused on optimizing embedding prompts and have overlooked the benefits of utilizing the generative abilities of LLMs. We propose a novel method, GenEOL, which uses LLMs to generate diverse transformations of a sentence that preserve its meaning, and aggregates the resulting embeddings of these transformations to enhance the overall sentence embedding. GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. GenEOL also achieves notable gains in clustering, reranking, and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark. Additionally, GenEOL stabilizes representation quality across LLM layers and remains robust to perturbations of embedding prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context. Such conflicts can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can identify knowledge conflicts and whether it is possible to know which source of knowledge the model will rely on by analysing the residual stream of the LLM. Through probing tasks, we find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge conflict in the residual stream, which can be accurately detected by probing the intermediate model activations. This allows us to detect conflicts within the residual stream before generating the answers without modifying the input or model parameters. Moreover, we find that the residual stream shows significantly different patterns when the model relies on contextual knowledge versus parametric knowledge to resolve conflicts. This pattern can be employed to estimate the behaviour of LLMs when conflict happens and prevent unexpected answers before producing the answers. Our analysis offers insights into how LLMs internally manage knowledge conflicts and provides a foundation for developing methods to control the knowledge selection processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their safety. While many studies have focused on English, the safety of LLMs in Arabic, with its linguistic and cultural complexities, remains under-explored. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we present an Arab-region-specific safety evaluation dataset consisting of 5,799 questions, including direct attacks, indirect attacks, and harmless requests with sensitive words, adapted to reflect the socio-cultural context of the Arab world. To uncover the impact of different stances in handling sensitive and controversial topics, we propose a dual-perspective evaluation framework. It assesses the LLM responses from both governmental and opposition viewpoints. Experiments over five leading Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs reveal substantial disparities in their safety performance. This reinforces the need for culturally specific datasets to ensure the responsible deployment of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Qiu, Alexander R. Fabbri, Divyansh Agarwal, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Sarah Tan, Nanyun Peng, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Pradyot Prakash, Alexander Radovic, Akshay Shekher, Denis Savenkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Research has shown the effectiveness of reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), planning (e.g., SelfAsk), and retrieval augmented generation strategies to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, such as question answering. However, using a single fixed strategy to answer different kinds of questions is suboptimal in performance and inefficient in terms of generated output tokens and performed retrievals. In our work, we propose a novel technique DyPlan, to induce a dynamic strategy selection process in LLMs, to improve performance and reduce costs in question-answering. DyPlan incorporates an initial decision step to select the most suitable strategy conditioned on the input question and guides the LLM's response generation accordingly. We extend DyPlan to DyPlan-verify, adding an internal verification and correction process to further enrich the generated answer. Experiments on three prominent multi-hop question answering (MHQA) datasets reveal how DyPlan can improve model performance by 7-13% while reducing the cost by 11-32% relative to the best baseline model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Yu, Runxue Bao, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Jiayu Zhou, Cao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can learn vast amounts of knowledge from diverse domains during pre-training. However, long-tail knowledge from specialized domains is often scarce and underrepresented, rarely appearing in the models' memorization. Prior work has shown that in-context learning (ICL) with retriever augmentation can help LLMs better capture long-tail knowledge, reducing their reliance on pre-trained data. Despite these advances, we observe that LLM predictions for long-tail questions remain uncertain to variations in retrieved samples. To take advantage of the uncertainty in ICL for guiding LLM predictions toward correct answers on long-tail samples, we propose a reinforcement learning-based dynamic uncertainty ranking method for ICL that accounts for the varying impact of each retrieved sample on LLM predictions. Our approach prioritizes more informative and stable samples while demoting misleading ones, updating rankings based on the feedback from the LLM w.r.t. each retrieved sample. To enhance training efficiency and reduce query costs, we introduce a learnable dynamic ranking threshold, adjusted when the model encounters negative prediction shifts. Experimental results on various question-answering datasets from different domains show that our method outperforms the best baseline by $2.76\%$, with a notable $5.96\%$ boost in accuracy on long-tail questions that elude zero-shot inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Alazraki, Marek Rei</p>
<p>Abstract: External tools help large language models succeed at tasks where they would otherwise typically fail. In existing frameworks, choosing tools at test time relies on naive greedy decoding, regardless of whether the model has been fine-tuned on tool-annotated data or prompted with in-context examples. In contrast, we find that gathering and choosing among a suitable set of candidate tools has greater potential to lead to an optimal selection. We present Tool selECTion via meta-reasONing (TECTON), a two-phase system that first reasons over a task and outputs candidate tools using a custom fine-tuned language modelling head. Then, with the custom head disabled, it meta-reasons (i.e., it reasons over the previous reasoning process) to make a final choice. We show that TECTON results in substantial gains--both in-distribution and out-of-distribution--on a range of math reasoning datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of evaluation datasets to assess LLMs understanding across a wide range of subjects and domains, identifying a suitable language understanding benchmark has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore LLM evaluation challenges for low-resource language understanding and introduce \proverbeval, LLM evaluation benchmark for low-resource languages, focusing on low-resource language understanding in culture-specific scenarios. We benchmark various LLMs and explore factors that create variability in the benchmarking process. We observed performance variances of up to 50\%, depending on the order in which answer choices were presented in multiple-choice tasks. Native language proverb descriptions significantly improve tasks such as proverb generation, contributing to improved outcomes. Additionally, monolingual evaluations consistently outperformed their cross-lingual counterparts in generation tasks. We argue that special attention must be given to the order of choices, the choice of prompt language, task variability, and generation tasks when creating LLM evaluation benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Ferrando, Oscar Obeso, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models are a widespread problem, yet the mechanisms behind whether models will hallucinate are poorly understood, limiting our ability to solve this problem. Using sparse autoencoders as an interpretability tool, we discover that a key part of these mechanisms is entity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall facts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the representation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g. detecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This suggests that models can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own capabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the model to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate attributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. We demonstrate that despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these directions have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior, suggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism. Furthermore, we provide an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of these directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of downstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Jiabei Chen, Zeng Xiangrong, Bingning Wang, Guang Liu, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured data, such as tables, graphs, and databases, play a critical role in plentiful NLP tasks such as question answering and dialogue system. Recently, inspired by Vision-Language Models, Graph Neutral Networks (GNNs) have been introduced as an additional modality into the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance on Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) tasks. However, those GNN-enhanced LLMs have the following limitations: (1) They employ diverse GNNs to model varying types of structured data, rendering them unable to uniformly process various forms of structured data. (2) The pretraining of GNNs is coupled with specific LLMs, which prevents GNNs from fully aligning with the textual space and limits their adaptability to other LLMs. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage and \textbf{S}tructured Data \textbf{A}ssistant (LLaSA), a general framework for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle structured data. Specifically, we represent various types of structured data in a unified hypergraph format, and use self-supervised learning to pretrain a hypergraph encoder, and a G-Former compressing encoded hypergraph representations with cross-attention. The compressed hypergraph representations are appended to the serialized inputs during training and inference stages of LLMs. Experimental results on multiple SKG tasks show that our pretrained hypergraph encoder can adapt to various LLMs and enhance their ability to process different types of structured data. Besides, LLaSA, with LoRA fine-tuning, outperforms previous SOTA method using full parameters tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Ponkshe, Raghav Singhal, Eduard Gorbunov, Alexey Tumanov, Samuel Horvath, Praneeth Vepakomma</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using \textbf{27-90} times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhu Liu, Cunliang Kong, Ying Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic map models (SMMs) construct a network-like conceptual space from cross-linguistic instances or forms, based on the connectivity hypothesis. This approach has been widely used to represent similarity and entailment relationships in cross-linguistic concept comparisons. However, most SMMs are manually built by human experts using bottom-up procedures, which are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs in a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is subsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics we propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic measures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off between precision and coverage. A case study on cross-linguistic supplementary adverbs demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared to human annotations and other automated methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pimpitchaya Kositcharoensuk, Nakarin Sritrakool, Ploy N. Pratanwanich</p>
<p>Abstract: Text summarization is a process of condensing lengthy texts while preserving their essential information. Previous studies have predominantly focused on high-resource languages, while low-resource languages like Thai have received less attention. Furthermore, earlier extractive summarization models for Thai texts have primarily relied on the article's body, without considering the headline. This omission can result in the exclusion of key sentences from the summary. To address these limitations, we propose CHIMA, an extractive summarization model that incorporates the contextual information of the headline for Thai news articles. Our model utilizes a pre-trained language model to capture complex language semantics and assigns a probability to each sentence to be included in the summary. By leveraging the headline to guide sentence selection, CHIMA enhances the model's ability to recover important sentences and discount irrelevant ones. Additionally, we introduce two strategies for aggregating headline-body similarities, simple average and harmonic mean, providing flexibility in sentence selection to accommodate varying writing styles. Experiments on publicly available Thai news datasets demonstrate that CHIMA outperforms baseline models across ROUGE, BLEU, and F1 scores. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating the headline-body similarities as model guidance. The results also indicate an enhancement in the model's ability to recall critical sentences, even those scattered throughout the middle or end of the article. With this potential, headline-guided extractive summarization offers a promising approach to improve the quality and relevance of summaries for Thai news articles.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large language models has raised growing concerns about their misuse, particularly in cases where AI-generated text is falsely attributed to human authors. Machine-generated content detectors claim to effectively identify such text under various conditions and from any language model. This paper critically evaluates these claims by assessing several popular detectors (RADAR, Wild, T5Sentinel, Fast-DetectGPT, PHD, LogRank, Binoculars) on a range of domains, datasets, and models that these detectors have not previously encountered. We employ various prompting strategies to simulate practical adversarial attacks, demonstrating that even moderate efforts can significantly evade detection. We emphasize the importance of the true positive rate at a specific false positive rate (TPR@FPR) metric and demonstrate that these detectors perform poorly in certain settings, with TPR@.01 as low as 0%. Our findings suggest that both trained and zero-shot detectors struggle to maintain high sensitivity while achieving a reasonable true positive rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Beetham, Souradip Chakraborty, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional jailbreaks have successfully exposed vulnerabilities in LLMs, primarily relying on discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent methods focus on training LLMs to generate adversarial prompts. However, both approaches are computationally expensive and slow, often requiring significant resources to generate a single successful attack. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of these methods arises from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem itself. To address this gap, we approach the jailbreak problem as an alignment problem, leading us to propose LIAR (Leveraging Inference time Alignment to jailbReak), a fast and efficient best-of-N approach tailored for jailbreak attacks. LIAR offers several key advantages: it eliminates the need for additional training, operates in a fully black-box setting, significantly reduces computational overhead, and produces more human-readable adversarial prompts while maintaining competitive attack success rates. Our results demonstrate that a best-of-N approach is a simple yet highly effective strategy for evaluating the robustness of aligned LLMs, achieving attack success rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a 10x improvement in perplexity and a significant speedup in Time-to-Attack, reducing execution time from tens of hours to seconds. Additionally, We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed LIAR. Our work highlights the potential of efficient, alignment-based jailbreak strategies for assessing and stress-testing AI safety measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: To deploy language models safely, it is crucial that they abstain from responding to inappropriate requests. Several prior studies test the safety promises of models based on their effectiveness in blocking malicious requests. In this work, we focus on evaluating the underlying techniques that cause models to abstain. We create SELECT, a benchmark derived from a set of benign concepts (e.g., "rivers") from a knowledge graph. Focusing on benign concepts isolates the effect of safety training, and grounding these concepts in a knowledge graph allows us to study the generalization and specificity of abstention techniques. Using SELECT, we benchmark different abstention techniques over six open-weight and closed-source models. We find that the examined techniques indeed cause models to abstain with over $80\%$ abstention rates. However, these techniques are not as effective for descendants of the target concepts, where abstention rates drop by $19\%$. We also characterize the generalization-specificity trade-offs for different techniques. Overall, no single technique is invariably better than others, and our findings inform practitioners of the various trade-offs involved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a filter-then-generate paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as evaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long thought, showing its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and apply Operations Research Question Answering (ORQA), a new benchmark designed to assess the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the specialized technical domain of Operations Research (OR). This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can emulate the knowledge and reasoning skills of OR experts when confronted with diverse and complex optimization problems. The dataset, developed by OR experts, features real-world optimization problems that demand multistep reasoning to construct their mathematical models. Our evaluations of various open source LLMs, such as LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek, and Mixtral, reveal their modest performance, highlighting a gap in their ability to generalize to specialized technical domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhou, Mohsen Mesgar, Annemarie Friedrich, Heike Adel</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex table question answering (TQA) aims to answer questions that require complex reasoning, such as multi-step or multi-category reasoning, over data represented in tabular form. Previous approaches demonstrated notable performance by leveraging either closed-source large language models (LLMs) or fine-tuned open-weight LLMs. However, fine-tuning LLMs requires high-quality training data, which is costly to obtain, and utilizing closed-source LLMs poses accessibility challenges and leads to reproducibility issues. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool use (MACT), a framework that requires neither closed-source models nor fine-tuning. In MACT, a planning agent and a coding agent that also make use of tools collaborate to answer questions. Our experiments on four TQA benchmarks show that MACT outperforms previous SoTA systems on three out of four benchmarks and that it performs comparably to the larger and more expensive closed-source model GPT-4 on two benchmarks, even when using only open-weight models without any fine-tuning. We conduct extensive analyses to prove the effectiveness of MACT's multi-agent collaboration in TQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsz Kin Lam, Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Luisa Bentivogli, Barry Haddow</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, there is increasing interest in extending their capabilities to speech -- the most common form of communication. The most widespread approach to integrating speech into LLMs is dense feature prepending (DFP), which prepends the projected speech representations to the textual representations, allowing end-to-end training with a speech encoder. This raises questions about the need for a sophisticated speech encoder for DFP and how its performance compares with a standard encoder-decoder (i.e., cross-attention) architecture. We compare DFP and cross-attention under a variety of configurations, such as CTC compression, sequence-level knowledge distillation, on monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual models. To perform a controlled architectural comparison, we train all models from scratch rather than using large pretrained models and use comparable data and parameter settings, testing speech-to-text recognition (ASR) and translation (ST) on MuST-C v1.0 and CoVoST2 datasets. Despite the wide adoption of DFP, our results do not indicate a clear advantage of DFP over cross-attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Al-Lawati, Jason Lucas, Prasenjit Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which translates natural language into formal code representations. However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03835">TACLR: A Scalable and Efficient Retrieval-based Method for Industrial Product Attribute Value Identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yindu Su, Huike Zou, Lin Sun, Ting Zhang, Haiyang Yang, Liyu Chen, David Lo, Qingheng Zhang, Shuguang Han, Jufeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendations, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Moreover, it has been successfully deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform, processing millions of product listings daily while supporting dynamic, large-scale attribute taxonomies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Matarazzo, Riccardo Torlone</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the transformer architecture, has redefined the capabilities of natural language processing. These models now exhibit remarkable performance across various language-related tasks, such as text generation, question answering, translation, and summarization, often rivaling human-like comprehension. More intriguingly, LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond their core functions, showing proficiency in tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and arithmetic. This survey paper explores the foundational components, scaling mechanisms, and architectural strategies that drive these capabilities. Emphasizing models like GPT and LLaMA, we analyze the impact of exponential data and computational growth on LLM performance, while also addressing the trade-offs associated with scaling. We also examine LLM applications across sectors, such as healthcare, finance, education, and law, highlighting their adaptability and potential to solve domain-specific challenges. Central to this work are the questions of how LLMs generalize across diverse tasks, exhibit planning, and reasoning abilities, and whether these emergent abilities can be systematically elicited or enhanced. In particular, we provide some insights into the CoT (Chain of Thought) and PoT (Plan of Thought) abilities within LLMs, focusing on how pre-training data influences their emergence. Additionally, we investigate LLM-modulo frameworks that integrate external systems, allowing LLMs to handle complex, dynamic tasks. By analyzing these factors, this paper aims to foster the ongoing discussion on the capabilities and limits of LLMs, promoting their responsible development and application in novel and increasingly complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Qiu, Dongliang Guo, Natalie Papini, Noelle Peace, Cheri A. Levinson, Teague R. Henry</p>
<p>Abstract: Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use.
  In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations.
  We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Belu Ticona, Fernando Carranza, Viviana Cotik</p>
<p>Abstract: Argentina has a large yet little-known Indigenous linguistic diversity, encompassing at least 40 different languages. The majority of these languages are at risk of disappearing, resulting in a significant loss of world heritage and cultural knowledge. Currently, unified information on speakers and computational tools is lacking for these languages. In this work, we present a systematization of the Indigenous languages spoken in Argentina, classifying them into seven language families: Mapuche, Tup\'i-Guaran\'i, Guaycur\'u, Quechua, Mataco-Mataguaya, Aymara, and Chon. For each one, we present an estimation of the national Indigenous population size, based on the most recent Argentinian census. We discuss potential reasons why the census questionnaire design may underestimate the actual number of speakers. We also provide a concise survey of computational resources available for these languages, whether or not they were specifically developed for Argentinian varieties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saibo Geng, Hudson Cooper, Micha{\l} Moskal, Samuel Jenkins, Julian Berman, Nathan Ranchin, Robert West, Eric Horvitz, Harsha Nori</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably generating structured outputs has become a critical capability for modern language model (LM) applications. Constrained decoding has emerged as the dominant technology across sectors for enforcing structured outputs during generation. Despite its growing adoption, little has been done with the systematic evaluation of the behaviors and performance of constrained decoding. Constrained decoding frameworks have standardized around JSON Schema as a structured data format, with most uses guaranteeing constraint compliance given a schema. However, there is poor understanding of the effectiveness of the methods in practice. We present an evaluation framework to assess constrained decoding approaches across three critical dimensions: efficiency in generating constraint-compliant outputs, coverage of diverse constraint types, and quality of the generated outputs. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce JSONSchemaBench, a benchmark for constrained decoding comprising 10K real-world JSON schemas that encompass a wide range of constraints with varying complexity. We pair the benchmark with the existing official JSON Schema Test Suite and evaluate six state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks, including Guidance, Outlines, Llamacpp, XGrammar, OpenAI, and Gemini. Through extensive experiments, we gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of constrained decoding on structured generation with real-world JSON schemas. Our work provides actionable insights for improving constrained decoding frameworks and structured generation tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating constrained decoding and structured generation. We release JSONSchemaBench at https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Robino</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Materials discovery and design are essential for advancing technology across various industries by enabling the development of application-specific materials. Recent research has leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate this process. We explore the potential of LLMs to generate viable hypotheses that, once validated, can expedite materials discovery. Collaborating with materials science experts, we curated a novel dataset from recent journal publications, featuring real-world goals, constraints, and methods for designing real-world applications. Using this dataset, we test LLM-based agents that generate hypotheses for achieving given goals under specific constraints. To assess the relevance and quality of these hypotheses, we propose a novel scalable evaluation metric that emulates the process a materials scientist would use to evaluate a hypothesis critically. Our curated dataset, proposed method, and evaluation framework aim to advance future research in accelerating materials discovery and design with LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwen Tang, Qiming Guo, Wenbo Sun, Yi Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form mental health assessments pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often exhibit hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning when handling extended, domain-specific contexts. We introduce Stacked Multi-Model Reasoning (SMMR), a layered framework that leverages multiple LLMs and specialized smaller models as coequal 'experts'. Early layers isolate short, discrete subtasks, while later layers integrate and refine these partial outputs through more advanced long-context models. We evaluate SMMR on the DAIC-WOZ depression-screening dataset and 48 curated case studies with psychiatric diagnoses, demonstrating consistent improvements over single-model baselines in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and PHQ-8 error reduction. By harnessing diverse 'second opinions', SMMR mitigates hallucinations, captures subtle clinical nuances, and enhances reliability in high-stakes mental health assessments. Our findings underscore the value of multi-expert frameworks for more trustworthy AI-driven screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Go Kamoda, Benjamin Heinzerling, Tatsuro Inaba, Keito Kudo, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui</p>
<p>Abstract: According to the stages-of-inference hypothesis, early layers of language models map their subword-tokenized input, which does not necessarily correspond to a linguistically meaningful segmentation, to more meaningful representations that form the model's "inner vocabulary". Prior analysis of this detokenization stage has predominantly relied on probing and interventions such as path patching, which involve selecting particular inputs, choosing a subset of components that will be patched, and then observing changes in model behavior. Here, we show that several important aspects of the detokenization stage can be understood purely by analyzing model weights, without performing any model inference steps. Specifically, we introduce an analytical decomposition of first-layer attention in GPT-2. Our decomposition yields interpretable terms that quantify the relative contributions of position-related, token-related, and mixed effects. By focusing on terms in this decomposition, we discover weight-based explanations of attention bias toward close tokens and attention for detokenization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterspeech has emerged as a popular and effective strategy for combating online hate speech, sparking growing research interest in automating its generation using language models. However, the field still lacks standardised evaluation protocols and reliable automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (Auto-CSEval), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that Auto-CSEval outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant improvement in automated counterspeech evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training of language models, either through reinforcement learning, preference optimization or supervised finetuning, tends to sharpen the output probability distribution and reduce the diversity of generated responses. This is particularly a problem for creative generative tasks where varied responses are desired. In this work we introduce Diverse Preference Optimization (DivPO), an optimization method which learns to generate much more diverse responses than standard pipelines, while maintaining the quality of the generations. In DivPO, preference pairs are selected by first considering a pool of responses, and a measure of diversity among them, and selecting chosen examples as being more rare but high quality, while rejected examples are more common, but low quality. DivPO results in generating 45.6% more diverse persona attributes, and an 74.6% increase in story diversity, while maintaining similar win rates as standard baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng Wang, Zhiyuan Fan, Qingyun Wang, May Fung, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on extensive multilingual corpora to acquire both language-specific cultural knowledge and general knowledge. Ideally, while LLMs should provide consistent responses to culture-independent questions across languages, we observe significant performance disparities. To address this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given question, we sample multiple responses across different languages and select the most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining responses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing cross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval-augmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages involved in CALM training leads to higher accuracy and consistency. We offer a qualitative analysis of how cross-lingual consistency can enhance knowledge alignment and explore the method's generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zheng, Yixiao Chen, Weitong Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Yun Li, Zhengzhong Liu, Eric P. Xing, Hongyi Wang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel CITER (Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs & LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyang Wu, Mingkuan Feng, Shuai Zhang, Ruihan Jin, Feihu Che, Zengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but still face challenges in complex visual reasoning. While recent efforts attempt to enhance MLLMs' reasoning by incorporating OpenAI o1-like structured thinking through explicit search structures or teacher-guided distillation, they often struggle to balance performance and efficiency. A critical limitation is their heavy reliance on extensive data and search spaces, resulting in low-efficiency implicit insight extraction and data utilization. To address this, we propose AStar, an Automated Structured thinking paradigm for multimodal reasoning via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). AStar automatically derives high-level cognitive reasoning patterns from limited data using MCTS-powered hierarchical structures. Building on these explicit patterns, we design a unified reasoning framework that seamlessly integrates models' internal reasoning capabilities and external reasoning guidelines, enabling efficient inference with minimal tree iterations. This novel paradigm strikes a compelling balance between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate AStar's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy (54.0$\%$) on the MathVerse benchmark with a 7B backbone, surpassing GPT-4o (50.2$\%$) while maintaining substantial data and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Ye, Tianze Zhang, Yuhang Xie, Liyuan Zhang, Yuanyi Ren, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Clavi\'e, Nathan Cooper, Benjamin Warner</p>
<p>Abstract: While encoder-only models such as BERT and ModernBERT are ubiquitous in real-world NLP applications, their conventional reliance on task-specific classification heads can limit their applicability compared to decoder-based large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce ModernBERT-Large-Instruct, a 0.4B-parameter encoder model that leverages its masked language modelling (MLM) head for generative classification. Our approach employs an intentionally simple training loop and inference mechanism that requires no heavy pre-processing, heavily engineered prompting, or architectural modifications. ModernBERT-Large-Instruct exhibits strong zero-shot performance on both classification and knowledge-based tasks, outperforming similarly sized LLMs on MMLU and achieving 93% of Llama3-1B's MMLU performance with 60% less parameters. We also demonstrate that, when fine-tuned, the generative approach using the MLM head matches or even surpasses traditional classification-head methods across diverse NLU tasks.This capability emerges specifically in models trained on contemporary, diverse data mixes, with models trained on lower volume, less-diverse data yielding considerably weaker performance. Although preliminary, these results demonstrate the potential of using the original generative masked language modelling head over traditional task-specific heads for downstream tasks. Our work suggests that further exploration into this area is warranted, highlighting many avenues for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Litian Liu, Reza Pourreza, Sunny Panchal, Apratim Bhattacharyya, Yao Qin, Roland Memisevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating plausible yet incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Effectively detecting hallucinations is therefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked hallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be detected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set of samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens defined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue that it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show that detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model uncertainty in the Bayesian sense. To this end, we propose a very simple and efficient approach that perturbs an appropriate subset of model parameters, or equivalently hidden unit activations, during sampling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a wide range of datasets and model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanye Liu, Jiahang Xu, Li Lyna Zhang, Qi Chen, Xuan Feng, Yang Chen, Zhongxin Guo, Yuqing Yang, Peng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant capability across various tasks, with their real-world effectiveness often driven by prompt design. While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChamaleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChamaleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChamaleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseok Jung (May), Cynthia Fuertes Panizo (May), Liam Dugan (May), Yi R. (May),  Fung, Pin-Yu Chen, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., {\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text. However, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for subgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles than open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification that disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and learns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of performance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and decreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework paves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated output detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabiul Awal, Le Zhang, Aishwarya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore effective prompting techniques to enhance zero- and few-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance in contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Paischer, Markus Hofmarcher, Sepp Hochreiter, Thomas Adler</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have advanced the state of the art in a variety of multi-modal tasks including image captioning and caption evaluation. Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Li, Philipp Wu, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: An interactive robot framework accomplishes long-horizon task planning and can easily generalize to new goals and distinct tasks, even during execution. However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, making it hard to generalize to different goals. Recent large language model based approaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain specific pretrained models. To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models by incorporating both high-level planning and low-level skill execution through function calling, leveraging pretrained vision models to ground the scene in language. We verify the robustness of our system on the real world task of making milk tea drinks. Our system is able to generate novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and successfully accomplishes user tasks. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps. Our approach is easy to adapt to different tasks by simply substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Min Cho, Dandan Pang, Stuti Thapa, Garrick Sherman, Lyle Ungar, Louis Tay, Sharath Chandra Guntuku</p>
<p>Abstract: While affective expressions on social media have been extensively studied, most research has focused on the Western context. This paper explores cultural differences in affective expressions by comparing valence and arousal on Twitter/X (geolocated to the US) and Sina Weibo (in Mainland China). Using the NRC-VAD lexicon to measure valence and arousal, we identify distinct patterns of emotional expression across both platforms. Our analysis reveals a functional representation between valence and arousal, showing a negative offset in contrast to traditional lab-based findings which suggest a positive offset. Furthermore, we uncover significant cross-cultural differences in arousal, with US users displaying higher emotional intensity than Chinese users, regardless of the valence of the content. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive language analysis correlating n-grams and LDA topics with affective dimensions to deepen our understanding of how language and culture shape emotional expression. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of affective communication across cultural and linguistic contexts on social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Eric John Li, Man Ho Lam, Tian Liang, Wenxuan Wang, Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae-hee So, Joonhwan Chang, Eunji Kim, Junho Na, JiYeon Choi, Jy-yong Sohn, Byung-Hoon Kim, Sang Hui Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities in psychiatric interviews, an underexplored area where LLMs could be valuable. This study focuses on enhancing psychiatric interviews by analyzing counseling data from North Korean defectors who have experienced trauma and mental health issues.
  Objective: The study investigates whether LLMs can (1) identify parts of conversations that suggest psychiatric symptoms and recognize those symptoms, and (2) summarize stressors and symptoms based on interview transcripts.
  Methods: LLMs are tasked with (1) extracting stressors from transcripts, (2) identifying symptoms and their corresponding sections, and (3) generating interview summaries using the extracted data. The transcripts were labeled by mental health experts for training and evaluation.
  Results: In the zero-shot inference setting using GPT-4 Turbo, 73 out of 102 segments demonstrated a recall mid-token distance d < 20 in identifying symptom-related sections. For recognizing specific symptoms, fine-tuning outperformed zero-shot inference, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.82. For the generative summarization task, LLMs using symptom and stressor information scored highly on G-Eval metrics: coherence (4.66), consistency (4.73), fluency (2.16), and relevance (4.67). Retrieval-augmented generation showed no notable performance improvement.
  Conclusions: LLMs, with fine-tuning or appropriate prompting, demonstrated strong accuracy (over 0.8) for symptom delineation and achieved high coherence (4.6+) in summarization. This study highlights their potential to assist mental health practitioners in analyzing psychiatric interviews.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Nemecek, Yuzhou Jiang, Erman Ayday</p>
<p>Abstract: The indistinguishability of Large Language Model (LLM) output from human-authored content poses significant challenges, raising concerns about potential misuse of AI-generated text and its influence on future AI model training. Watermarking algorithms offer a viable solution by embedding detectable signatures into generated text. However, existing watermarking methods often entail trade-offs among attack robustness, generation quality, and additional overhead such as specialized frameworks or complex integrations. We propose a lightweight, topic-guided watermarking scheme for LLMs that partitions the vocabulary into topic-aligned token subsets. Given an input prompt, the scheme selects a relevant topic-specific token list, effectively "green-listing" semantically aligned tokens to embed robust marks while preserving the text's fluency and coherence. Experimental results across multiple LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable perplexity to industry-leading systems, including Google's SynthID-Text, yet enhances watermark robustness against paraphrasing and lexical perturbation attacks while introducing minimal performance overhead. Our approach avoids reliance on additional mechanisms beyond standard text generation pipelines, facilitating straightforward adoption, suggesting a practical path toward globally consistent watermarking of AI-generated content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of completing knowledge intensive tasks by recalling information from a static pretraining corpus. Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in visual question-answering and reasoning tasks through vision instruction tuning on specific datasets. However, there remains significant room for improvement in aligning visual and language modalities. Existing methods often depend on external models or data, leading to uncontrollable and unstable alignment results. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a self-improvement framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment without external dependencies. SIMA leverages existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses, incorporating an in-context self-critic mechanism that constructs preference pairs for tuning. Crucially, our approach allows LVLMs to act as critics by designing effective critic prompts, eliminating the need for additional fine-tuning with external instruction data. We introduce three novel visual metrics within the self-critic process to guide judgment, significantly improving the accuracy of self-critic. Through extensive experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA significantly improves LVLM's performance and outperforms previous approaches, achieving superior modality alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olena Burda-Lassen, Aman Chadha, Shashank Goswami, Vinija Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: An image is often considered worth a thousand words, and certain images can tell rich and insightful stories. Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Pu Cai, Ming-Yang Li, Wu-Jun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising performance in many tasks. However, the high storage and computational cost of LLMs has become a challenge for deploying LLMs. Weight quantization has been widely used for model compression, which can reduce both storage and computational cost. Most existing weight quantization methods for LLMs use a rank-one codebook for quantization, which results in substantial accuracy loss when the compression ratio is high. In this paper, we propose a novel weight quantization method, called low-rank codebook based quantization~(LCQ), for LLMs. LCQ adopts a low-rank codebook, the rank of which can be larger than one, for quantization. Experiments show that LCQ can achieve better accuracy than existing methods with a negligibly extra storage cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jiang, Yangxinyu Xie, Xiaomeng Wang, Yuan Yuan, Zhuoqun Hao, Xinyi Bai, Weijie J. Su, Camillo J. Taylor, Tanwi Mallick</p>
<p>Abstract: This work discusses how to build more rational language and multimodal agents and what criteria define rationality in intelligent systems.Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by decision-making that aligns with evidence and logical principles. It plays a crucial role in reliable problem-solving by ensuring well-grounded and consistent solutions. Despite their progress, large language models (LLMs) often fall short of rationality due to their bounded knowledge space and inconsistent outputs. In response, recent efforts have shifted toward developing multimodal and multi-agent systems, as well as integrating modules like external tools, programming codes, symbolic reasoners, utility function, and conformal risk controls rather than relying solely on a single LLM for decision-making. This paper surveys state-of-the-art advancements in language and multimodal agents, assesses their role in enhancing rationality, and outlines open challenges and future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Zhendong Wang, Huangjie Zheng, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have demonstrated the ability to produce photorealistic images aligned with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Notably, the one-step distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves an FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, a record low value under the data-free setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-il Lee, Minbeom Kim, Seunghyun Yoon, Minsung Kim, Dongryeol Lee, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyuk Choi, Yeseon Hong, Bugeun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been recently adopted in interactive systems requiring communication. As the false belief in a model can harm the usability of such systems, LLMs should not have cognitive biases that humans have. Psychologists especially focus on the False Consensus Effect (FCE), a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the extent to which others share their beliefs or behaviors, because FCE can distract smooth communication by posing false beliefs. However, previous studies have less examined FCE in LLMs thoroughly, which needs more consideration of confounding biases, general situations, and prompt changes. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct two studies to examine the FCE phenomenon in LLMs. In Study 1, we investigate whether LLMs have FCE. In Study 2, we explore how various prompting styles affect the demonstration of FCE. As a result of these studies, we identified that popular LLMs have FCE. Also, the result specifies the conditions when FCE becomes more or less prevalent compared to normal usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after hundreds of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that progress on tamper-resistance is possible, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction. Our algorithm, called Tree Attention, for parallelizing exact attention computation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed asymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than state-of-the-art approaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less communication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory. We demonstrate that Tree Attention speeds up decoding up to 4x on Llama 3.1-8B and can be applied to a variety of hardware and networking setups such as H100 DGX nodes, AMD MI300x nodes, and PCIe connected NVIDIA RTX 4090s.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Miranda, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Andrea Santilli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, S\'ebastien Brati\`eres, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Segal, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici</p>
<p>Abstract: The utility of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on the quality and quantity of their training data. Many organizations possess large data corpora that could be leveraged to train or fine-tune LLMs tailored to their specific needs. However, these datasets often come with access restrictions that are based on user privileges and enforced by access control mechanisms. Training LLMs on such datasets could result in exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. A straightforward approach for preventing such exposure is to train a separate model for each access level. This, however, may result in low utility models due to the limited amount of training data per model compared to the amount in the entire organizational corpus. Another approach is to train a single LLM on all the data while limiting the exposure of unauthorized information. However, current exposure-limiting methods for LLMs are ineffective for access-controlled data, where sensitive information appears frequently across many training examples. We propose DOMBA - double model balancing - a simple approach for training and deploying LLMs that provides high utility and access-control functionality with security guarantees. DOMBA aggregates the probability distributions of two models, each trained on documents with (potentially many) different access levels, using a "min-bounded" average function (a function that is bounded by the smaller value, e.g., harmonic mean). A detailed mathematical analysis and extensive evaluation show that DOMBA safeguards restricted information while offering utility comparable to non-secure models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Feng, Yuwei Du, Jie Zhao, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Next location prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, due to the limitation of existing deep learning methods, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to zero-shot next location prediction task. However, they directly generate the final output using LLMs without systematic design, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized next location prediction. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task and design specific modules to complete them, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments utilizing mobility data from two distinct sources reveal that AgentMove surpasses the leading baseline by 3.33% to 8.57% across 8 out of 12 metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Liang, Qingqing Ye, Yanyun Wang, Sen Zhang, Yaxin Xiao, Ronghua Li, Jianliang Xu, Haibo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing attention in recent research. However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method in extracting various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/liangzid/LoRD-MEA.</p>

<p>Abstract: d/Deaf and hearing song-signers have become prevalent across video-sharing platforms, but translating songs into sign language remains cumbersome and inaccessible. Our formative study revealed the challenges song-signers face, including semantic, syntactic, expressive, and rhythmic considerations in translations. We present ELMI, an accessible song-signing tool that assists in translating lyrics into sign language. ELMI enables users to edit glosses line-by-line, with real-time synced lyric and music video snippets. Users can also chat with a large language model-driven AI to discuss meaning, glossing, emoting, and timing. Through an exploratory study with 13 song-signers, we examined how ELMI facilitates their workflows and how song-signers leverage and receive an LLM-driven chat for translation. Participants successfully adopted ELMI to song-signing, with active discussions throughout. They also reported improved confidence and independence in their translations, finding ELMI encouraging, constructive, and informative. We discuss research and design implications for accessible and culturally sensitive song-signing translation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure. This paper infuses LLMs with a traditional signal processing idea, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture in an academic setup, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, audio, and images. This is done by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Further, we show this extends to the Long Range Arena benchmark and several input representations such as characters, BPE tokens, bytes, waveform, math expression, and image pixels. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every decoder block. We hope this will pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing into pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rimvydas Rubavicius, Peter David Fagan, Alex Lascarides, Subramanian Ramamoorthy</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a challenging interactive task learning scenario we call rearrangement under unawareness: to manipulate a rigid-body environment in a context where the agent is unaware of a concept that is key to solving the instructed task. We propose SECURE, an interactive task learning framework designed to solve such problems. It uses embodied conversation to fix its deficient domain model -- through dialogue, the agent discovers and then learns to exploit unforeseen possibilities. In particular, SECURE learns from the user's embodied corrective feedback when it makes a mistake, and it makes strategic dialogue decisions to reveal useful evidence about novel concepts for solving the instructed task. Together, these abilities allow the agent to generalise to subsequent tasks using newly acquired knowledge. We demonstrate that learning to solve rearrangement under unawareness is more data efficient when the agent is semantics-aware -- that is, during both learning and inference it augments the evidence from the user's embodied conversation with its logical consequences, stemming from semantic analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones for multimodal intelligence, yet significant safety challenges limit their real-world application. While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashu He, Mingyu Derek Ma, Jinxuan Fan, Dan Roth, Wei Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches based on context prompting or reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the reasoning capacities of large language models (LLMs) depend on the LLMs' internal knowledge to produce reliable Chain-Of-Thought (CoT). However, no matter the size of LLMs, certain problems cannot be resolved in a single forward pass. Meanwhile, agent-based reasoning systems require access to a comprehensive nonparametric knowledge base, which is often costly or not feasible for use in scientific and niche domains. We present Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning method that merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input. GIVE guides the LLM agent to select the most pertinent expert data (observe), engage in query-specific divergent thinking (reflect), and then synthesize this information to produce the final output (speak). Extensive experiments demonstrated the following benefits of our framework: (1) GIVE boosts the performance of LLMs across various sizes. (2) In some scenarios, GIVE allows smaller LLMs to surpass larger, more sophisticated ones in scientific tasks (GPT3.5T + GIVE > GPT4). (3) GIVE is effective on scientific and open-domain assessments. (4) GIVE is a training-free method that enables LLMs to tackle new problems that extend beyond their training data (up to 43.5% -> 88.2%} accuracy improvement). (5) GIVE allows LLM agents to reason using both restricted (very small) and noisy (very large) knowledge sources, accommodating knowledge graphs (KG) ranging from 135 to more than 840k nodes. (6) The reasoning process involved in GIVE is fully interpretable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose Knowledge Base augmented Language Model (KBLaM), a new method for augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. KBLaM works with a knowledge base (KB) constructed from a corpus of documents, transforming each piece of knowledge in the KB into continuous key-value vector pairs via pre-trained sentence encoders with linear adapters and integrating them into pre-trained LLMs via a specialized rectangular attention mechanism. Unlike Retrieval-Augmented Generation, KBLaM eliminates external retrieval modules, and unlike in-context learning, its computational overhead scales linearly with KB size rather than quadratically. Our approach enables integrating a large KB of more than 10K triples into an 8B pre-trained LLM of only 8K context window on one single A100 80GB GPU and allows for dynamic updates without model fine-tuning or retraining. Experiments demonstrate KBLaM's effectiveness in various tasks, including question-answering and open-ended reasoning, while providing interpretable insights into its use of the augmented knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuofeng Gao, Huanqia Cai, Qingyao Shuai, Dihong Gong, Zhifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate mathematical reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial in revolutionizing domains that heavily rely on such reasoning. However, LLMs often encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning, leading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specifically designed to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling them to validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates through a sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate a program to address a given problem, execute this program using program-based tools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on the verification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalize the answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refine its reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of its mathematical reasoning. We implement CoSC using a two-phase fine-tuning approach. First, LLMs are trained with a relatively small volume of seeding data generated from GPT-4. Then, we enhance CoSC by training with a larger volume of self-generated data, without relying on GPT-4. Experiments show that CoSC significantly boosts performance on standard mathematical datasets compared to existing open-source LLMs. Notably, our CoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on the challenging MATH dataset, outperforming models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and multi-modal LLMs such as GPT-4V and Gemini-1.0. Importantly, CoSC operates in a zero-shot manner without requiring demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reno Kriz, Kate Sanders, David Etter, Kenton Murray, Cameron Carpenter, Kelly Van Ochten, Hannah Recknor, Jimena Guallar-Blasco, Alexander Martin, Ronald Colaianni, Nolan King, Eugene Yang, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently retrieving and synthesizing information from large-scale multimodal collections has become a critical challenge. However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungmin Min, Minbeom Kim, Kang-il Lee, Dongryeol Lee, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SumGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SumGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yara Shamshoum, Nitzan Hodos, Yuval Sieradzki, Assaf Schuster</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CompAct, a technique that reduces peak memory utilization on GPU by 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning of LLMs. Peak device memory is a major limiting factor in training LLMs, with various recent works aiming to reduce model memory. However most works don't target the largest component of allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored for the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used in the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous methods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained parameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding additional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either pretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing compute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher for larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaechang Kim, Jinmin Goh, Inseok Hwang, Jaewoong Cho, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based expert models have reached superhuman performance in decision-making domains such as chess and Go. However, it is under-explored to explain or comment on given decisions although it is important for model explainability and human education. The outputs of expert models are accurate, but yet difficult to interpret for humans. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can produce fluent commentary but are prone to hallucinations due to their limited decision-making capabilities. To bridge this gap between expert models and LLMs, we focus on chess commentary as a representative task of explaining complex decision-making processes through language and address both the generation and evaluation of commentary. We introduce Concept-guided Chess Commentary generation (CCC) for producing commentary and GPT-based Chess Commentary Evaluation (GCC-Eval) for assessing it. CCC integrates the decision-making strengths of expert models with the linguistic fluency of LLMs through prioritized, concept-based explanations. GCC-Eval leverages expert knowledge to evaluate chess commentary based on informativeness and linguistic quality. Experimental results, validated by both human judges and GCC-Eval, demonstrate that CCC generates commentary which is accurate, informative, and fluent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingqi Gao, Yifu Liu, Xiaoxia Li, Xiaorong Shi, Yin Zhu, Yiming Wang, Shiqi Li, Wei Li, Yuntao Hong, Zhiling Luo, Jinyang Gao, Liyu Mou, Yu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To tackle the challenges of large language model performance in natural language to SQL tasks, we introduce XiYan-SQL, an innovative framework that employs a multi-generator ensemble strategy to improve candidate generation. We introduce M-Schema, a semi-structured schema representation method designed to enhance the understanding of database structures. To enhance the quality and diversity of generated candidate SQL queries, XiYan-SQL integrates the significant potential of in-context learning (ICL) with the precise control of supervised fine-tuning. On one hand, we propose a series of training strategies to fine-tune models to generate high-quality candidates with diverse preferences. On the other hand, we implement the ICL approach with an example selection method based on named entity recognition to prevent overemphasis on entities. The refiner optimizes each candidate by correcting logical or syntactical errors. To address the challenge of identifying the best candidate, we fine-tune a selection model to distinguish nuances of candidate SQL queries. The experimental results on multiple dialect datasets demonstrate the robustness of XiYan-SQL in addressing challenges across different scenarios. Overall, our proposed XiYan-SQL achieves the state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 75.63% on Bird benchmark, 89.65% on the Spider test set, 69.86% on SQL-Eval, 41.20% on NL2GQL. The proposed framework not only enhances the quality and diversity of SQL queries but also outperforms previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Yanuka, Assaf Ben Kish, Yonatan Bitton, Idan Szpektor, Raja Giryes</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Zhao, Ximing Zhang, Chenji Lu, Hui Zhao, Tianshu Wu, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective query-item relevance modeling is pivotal for enhancing user experience and safeguarding user satisfaction in e-commerce search systems. Recently, benefiting from the vast inherent knowledge, Large Language Model (LLM) approach demonstrates strong performance and long-tail generalization ability compared with previous neural-based specialized relevance learning methods. Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following inadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational demands make it difficult to be deployed online. Second, distilling LLM models to online models is a feasible direction, but the LLM relevance modeling is a black box, and its rich intrinsic knowledge is difficult to extract and apply online. To improve the interpretability of LLM and boost the performance of online relevance models via LLM, we propose an Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation framework for e-commerce relevance learning, which comprises two core components: (1) An Explainable LLM for relevance modeling (ELLM-rele), which decomposes the relevance learning into intermediate steps and models relevance learning as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, thereby enhancing both interpretability and performance of LLM. (2) A Multi-dimensional Knowledge Distillation (MKD) architecture that transfers the knowledge of ELLM-rele to current deployable interaction-based and representation-based student models from both the relevance score distribution and CoT reasoning aspects. Through distilling the probabilistic and CoT reasoning knowledge, MKD improves both the semantic interaction and long-tail generalization abilities of student models. Extensive offline evaluations and online experiments on Taobao search ad scene demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances e-commerce relevance learning performance and user experience.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07121">Bridging the Gap for Test-Time Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirun Guo, Tao Jin, Wenlong Xu, Wang Lin, Yangyang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is an emerging research topic that aims to understand and recognize human sentiment or emotions through multiple modalities. However, in real-world dynamic scenarios, the distribution of target data is always changing and different from the source data used to train the model, which leads to performance degradation. Common adaptation methods usually need source data, which could pose privacy issues or storage overheads. Therefore, test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are introduced to improve the performance of the model at inference time. Existing TTA methods are always based on probabilistic models and unimodal learning, and thus can not be applied to MSA which is often considered as a multimodal regression task. In this paper, we propose two strategies: Contrastive Adaptation and Stable Pseudo-label generation (CASP) for test-time adaptation for multimodal sentiment analysis. The two strategies deal with the distribution shifts for MSA by enforcing consistency and minimizing empirical risk, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CASP brings significant and consistent improvements to the performance of the model across various distribution shift settings and with different backbones, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panayiotis Christou, Md. Zahidul Islam, Yuzhang Lin, Jingwei Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Power distribution networks are evolving due to the integration of DERs and increased customer participation. To maintain optimal operation, minimize losses, and meet varying load demands, frequent network reconfiguration is necessary. Traditionally, the reconfiguration task relies on optimization software and expert operators, but as systems grow more complex, faster and more adaptive solutions are required without expert intervention. Data-driven reconfiguration is gaining traction for its accuracy, speed, and robustness against incomplete network data. LLMs, with their ability to capture complex patterns, offer a promising approach for efficient and responsive network reconfiguration in evolving complex power networks.
  In this work, we introduce LLM4DistReconfig, a deep learning-based approach utilizing a fine-tuned LLM to solve the distribution network reconfiguration problem. By carefully crafting prompts and designing a custom loss function, we train the LLM with inputs representing network parameters such as buses, available lines, open lines, node voltages, and system loss. The model then predicts optimal reconfigurations by outputting updated network configurations that minimize system loss while meeting operational constraints. Our approach significantly reduces inference time compared to classical algorithms, allowing for near real-time optimal reconfiguration after training. Experimental results show that our method generates optimal configurations minimizing system loss for five individual and a combined test dataset. It also produces minimal invalid edges, no cycles, or subgraphs across all datasets, fulfilling domain-specific needs. Additionally, the generated responses contain less than 5% improper outputs on seen networks and satisfactory results on unseen networks, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for the reconfiguration task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p>

<p>Abstract: While much work on web agents emphasizes the promise of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of users, in reality, agents often fall short on complex tasks in real-world contexts and modeling user preference. This presents an opportunity for humans to collaborate with the agent and leverage the agent's capabilities effectively. We propose CowPilot, a framework supporting autonomous as well as human-agent collaborative web navigation, and evaluation across task success and task efficiency. CowPilot reduces the number of steps humans need to perform by allowing agents to propose next steps, while users are able to pause, reject, or take alternative actions. During execution, users can interleave their actions with the agent by overriding suggestions or resuming agent control when needed. We conducted case studies on five common websites and found that the human-agent collaborative mode achieves the highest success rate of 95% while requiring humans to perform only 15.2% of the total steps. Even with human interventions during task execution, the agent successfully drives up to half of task success on its own. CowPilot can serve as a useful tool for data collection and agent evaluation across websites, which we believe will enable research in how users and agents can work together.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkuan Feng, Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Pengpeng Shao, Ruihan Jin, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Feihu Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language model (LLM) alignment algorithms has resulted in a complex and fragmented landscape, with limited clarity on the effectiveness of different methods and their inter-connections. This paper introduces Reward-Aware Preference Optimization (RPO), a mathematical framework that unifies popular preference optimization techniques in LLM alignment, including DPO, IPO, SimPO, and REINFORCE (LOO), among others. RPO provides a structured approach to disentangle and systematically study the impact of various design choices, such as the optimization objective, the number of responses per prompt, and the use of implicit versus explicit reward models, on LLM preference optimization. We additionally propose a new experimental setup that enables the clean and direct ablation of such design choices. Through an extensive series of ablation studies within the RPO framework, we gain insights into the critical factors shaping model alignment, offering practical guidance on the most effective strategies for improving LLM alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long Context Language Models have drawn great attention in the past few years. There has been work discussing the impact of long context on Language Model performance: some find that long irrelevant context could harm performance, while some experimentally summarize loss reduction by relevant long context as Scaling Laws. This calls for a more thorough understanding on how long context impact Language Modeling. In this work, we (1) propose a clean and effective theoretical framework on explaining the impact of context length to Language Modeling, from an Intrinsic Space perspective; and (2) conduct experiments on natural language and synthetic data, validating our proposed theoretical assumptions and deductions. Our theoretical framework can provide practical insights such as establishing that training dataset size dictates an optimal context length and bounds context length scaling for certain case. We hope our work may inspire new long context Language Models, as well as future work studying Physics for Language Models.

<p>Abstract: Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces RoSeMary, the first-of-its-kind ML/Crypto codesign watermarking framework that regulates LLM-generated code to avoid intellectual property rights violations and inappropriate misuse in software development. High-quality watermarks adhering to the detectability-fidelity-robustness tri-objective are limited due to codes' low-entropy nature. Watermark verification, however, often needs to reveal the signature and requires re-encoding new ones for code reuse, which potentially compromising the system's usability. To overcome these challenges, RoSeMary obtains high-quality watermarks by training the watermark insertion and extraction modules end-to-end to ensure (i) unaltered watermarked code functionality and (ii) enhanced detectability and robustness leveraging pre-trained CodeT5 as the insertion backbone to enlarge the code syntactic and variable rename transformation search space. In the deployment, RoSeMary uses zero-knowledge proofs for secure verification without revealing the underlying signatures. Extensive evaluations demonstrated RoSeMary achieves high detection accuracy while preserving the code functionality. RoSeMary is also robust against attacks and provides efficient secure watermark verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Li, Hao Chen, Yang Wang, Tingyuan Zhu, Weijia Zhang, Kaijie Zhu, Kam-Fai Wong, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets via large language models (LLMs) themselves has emerged as a promising approach to improve LLM performance. However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Formento, Chuan Sheng Foo, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental issue in deep learning has been adversarial robustness. As these systems have scaled, such issues have persisted. Currently, large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial attacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat models have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings or output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been reasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no information about the model is available apart from the generated output. This means that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to detect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while having only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved through the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show that the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current LLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the likelihood of misclassification. Our new proposed paradigm demonstrates promising state-of-the-art results on three datasets across two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) when comparing our technique to existing hard-label black-box attack methods that introduce word-level substitutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain vulnerable to malicious prompts that induce harmful outputs. Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.</p>
