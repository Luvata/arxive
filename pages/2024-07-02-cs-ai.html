<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Esencan, Tarun Advaith Kumar, Ata Akbari Asanjan, P. Aaron Lott, Masoud Mohseni, Can Unlu, Davide Venturelli, Alan Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities at tasks that require human intelligence and are a significant step towards human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Yet the performance of LLMs at reasoning tasks have been subpar and the reasoning capability of LLMs is a matter of significant debate. While it has been shown that the choice of the prompting technique to the LLM can alter its performance on a multitude of tasks, including reasoning, the best performing techniques require human-made prompts with the knowledge of the tasks at hand. We introduce a framework for what we call Combinatorial Reasoning (CR), a fully-automated prompting method, where reasons are sampled from an LLM pipeline and mapped into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The framework investigates whether QUBO solutions can be profitably used to select a useful subset of the reasons to construct a Chain-of-Thought style prompt. We explore the acceleration of CR with specialized solvers. We also investigate the performance of simpler zero-shot strategies such as linear majority rule or random selection of reasons. Our preliminary study indicates that coupling a combinatorial solver to generative AI pipelines is an interesting avenue for AI reasoning and elucidates design principles for future CR methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Xue, Avishree Khare, Rajeev Alur, Surbhi Goel, Eric Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how to subvert language models from following the rules. We model rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We prove that although transformers can faithfully abide by such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can nevertheless mislead even theoretically constructed models. Empirically, we find that attacks on our theoretical models mirror popular attacks on large language models. Our work suggests that studying smaller theoretical models can help understand the behavior of large language models in rule-based settings like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ju-Seung Byun, Jiyun Chun, Jihyung Kil, Andrew Perrault</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel at comprehending human instructions and demonstrate remarkable results across a broad spectrum of tasks. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) further refine LLMs by aligning them with specific preferences. These methods primarily use ranking-based feedback for entire generations. With advanced AI models (Teacher), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, we can request various types of detailed feedback that are expensive for humans to provide. We propose a two-stage algorithm ARES that Alternates REinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). First, we request the Teacher to score how much each sentence contributes to solving the problem in a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This sentence-level feedback allows us to consider individual valuable segments, providing more granular rewards for the RL procedure. Second, we ask the Teacher to correct the wrong reasoning after the RL stage. The RL procedure requires massive efforts for hyperparameter tuning and often generates errors like repetitive words and incomplete sentences. With the correction feedback, we stabilize the RL fine-tuned model through SFT. We conduct experiments on multi-model dataset ScienceQA and A-OKVQA to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. ARES rationale reasoning achieves around 70% win rate against baseline models judged by GPT-4o. Additionally, we observe that the improved rationale reasoning leads to a 2.5% increase in inference answer accuracy on average for the multi-modal datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Elhenawy, Ahmad Abutahoun, Taqwa I. Alhadidi, Ahmed Jaber, Huthaifa I. Ashqar, Shadi Jaradat, Ahmed Abdelhay, Sebastien Glaser, Andry Rakotonirainy</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) harness comprehensive knowledge spanning text, images, and audio to adeptly tackle complex problems, including zero-shot in-context learning scenarios. This study explores the ability of MLLMs in visually solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) using images that portray point distributions on a two-dimensional plane. We introduce a novel approach employing multiple specialized agents within the MLLM framework, each dedicated to optimizing solutions for these combinatorial challenges. Our experimental investigation includes rigorous evaluations across zero-shot settings and introduces innovative multi-agent zero-shot in-context scenarios. The results demonstrated that both multi-agent models. Multi-Agent 1, which includes the Initializer, Critic, and Scorer agents, and Multi-Agent 2, which comprises only the Initializer and Critic agents; significantly improved solution quality for TSP and mTSP problems. Multi-Agent 1 excelled in environments requiring detailed route refinement and evaluation, providing a robust framework for sophisticated optimizations. In contrast, Multi-Agent 2, focusing on iterative refinements by the Initializer and Critic, proved effective for rapid decision-making scenarios. These experiments yield promising outcomes, showcasing the robust visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in addressing diverse combinatorial problems. The findings underscore the potential of MLLMs as powerful tools in computational optimization, offering insights that could inspire further advancements in this promising field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nila Masrourisaadat, Nazanin Sedaghatkish, Fatemeh Sarshartehrani, Edward A. Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to significant interest in image synthesis, demonstrating the ability to generate high-quality images for a diverse range of text prompts. Despite this progress, most studies ignore the presence of bias. In this paper, we examine several text-to-image models not only by qualitatively assessing their performance in generating accurate images of human faces, groups, and specified numbers of objects but also by presenting a social bias analysis. As expected, models with larger capacity generate higher-quality images. However, we also document the inherent gender or social biases these models possess, offering a more complete understanding of their impact and limitations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00197">Tradeoffs When Considering Deep Reinforcement Learning for Contingency Management in Advanced Air Mobility</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis E. Alvarez, Marc W. Brittain, Steven D. Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Air transportation is undergoing a rapid evolution globally with the introduction of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and with it comes novel challenges and opportunities for transforming aviation. As AAM operations introduce increasing heterogeneity in vehicle capabilities and density, increased levels of automation are likely necessary to achieve operational safety and efficiency goals. This paper focuses on one example where increased automation has been suggested. Autonomous operations will need contingency management systems that can monitor evolving risk across a span of interrelated (or interdependent) hazards and, if necessary, execute appropriate control interventions via supervised or automated decision making. Accommodating this complex environment may require automated functions (autonomy) that apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that can adapt and respond to a quickly changing environment. This paper explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which has shown promising performance in complex and high-dimensional environments where the objective can be constructed as a sequential decision-making problem. An extension of a prior formulation of the contingency management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is presented and uses a DRL framework to train agents that mitigate hazards present in the simulation environment. A comparison of these learning-based agents and classical techniques is presented in terms of their performance, verification difficulties, and development process.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00256">One Prompt is not Enough: Automated Construction of a Mixture-of-Expert Prompts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Wang, Sohyun An, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, Sung Ju Hwang, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the searched prompt to one instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their capacity, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire complex problem space of the targeted task. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm and divide the problem space into a set of sub-regions; Each sub-region is governed by a specialized expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search of an instruction per expert complements the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), achieves an average win rate of 81% against prior arts across several major benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00264">External Model Motivated Agents: Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Environment Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishav Bhagat, Jonathan Balloch, Zhiyu Lin, Julia Kim, Mark Riedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike reinforcement learning (RL) agents, humans remain capable multitaskers in changing environments. In spite of only experiencing the world through their own observations and interactions, people know how to balance focusing on tasks with learning about how changes may affect their understanding of the world. This is possible by choosing to solve tasks in ways that are interesting and generally informative beyond just the current task. Motivated by this, we propose an agent influence framework for RL agents to improve the adaptation efficiency of external models in changing environments without any changes to the agent's rewards. Our formulation is composed of two self-contained modules: interest fields and behavior shaping via interest fields. We implement an uncertainty-based interest field algorithm as well as a skill-sampling-based behavior-shaping algorithm to use in testing this framework. Our results show that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of external model adaptation on metrics that measure both efficiency and performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312">UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zheng, Changliang Zhou, Tong Xialiang, Mingxuan Yuan, Zhenkun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown superiorities in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00379">GraphArena: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Graph Computational Problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianheng Tang, Qifan Zhang, Yuhan Li, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The "arms race" of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands novel, challenging, and diverse benchmarks to faithfully examine their progresses. We introduce GraphArena, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate LLMs on graph computational problems using million-scale real-world graphs from diverse scenarios such as knowledge graphs, social networks, and molecular structures. GraphArena offers a suite of 10 computational tasks, encompassing four polynomial-time (e.g., Shortest Distance) and six NP-complete challenges (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem). It features a rigorous evaluation framework that classifies LLM outputs as correct, suboptimal (feasible but not optimal), or hallucinatory (properly formatted but infeasible). Evaluation of 10 leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct, reveals that even top-performing models struggle with larger, more complex graph problems and exhibit hallucination issues. Despite the application of strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting, these issues remain unresolved. GraphArena contributes a valuable supplement to the existing LLM benchmarks and is open-sourced at https://github.com/squareRoot3/GraphArena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles require highly sophisticated decision-making to determine their motion. This paper describes how such functionality can be achieved with a practical rule engine learned from expert driving decisions. We propose an algorithm to create and maintain a rule-based behaviour planner, using a two-layer rule-based theory. The first layer determines a set of feasible parametrized behaviours, given the perceived state of the environment. From these, a resolution function chooses the most conservative high-level maneuver. The second layer then reconciles the parameters into a single behaviour. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we report results of its implementation in a level-3 autonomous vehicle and its field test in an urban environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Zhao, Jing Liu, Elena Parilina</p>
<p>Abstract: With wide application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become particularly important to make decisions of AI systems explainable and transparent. In this paper, we proposed a new Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called ShapG (Explanations based on Shapley value for Graphs) for measuring feature importance. ShapG is a model-agnostic global explanation method. At the first stage, it defines an undirected graph based on the dataset, where nodes represent features and edges are added based on calculation of correlation coefficients between features. At the second stage, it calculates an approximated Shapley value by sampling the data taking into account this graph structure. The sampling approach of ShapG allows to calculate the importance of features efficiently, i.e. to reduce computational complexity. Comparison of ShapG with other existing XAI methods shows that it provides more accurate explanations for two examined datasets. We also compared other XAI methods developed based on cooperative game theory with ShapG in running time, and the results show that ShapG exhibits obvious advantages in its running time, which further proves efficiency of ShapG. In addition, extensive experiments demonstrate a wide range of applicability of the ShapG method for explaining complex models. We find ShapG an important tool in improving explainability and transparency of AI systems and believe it can be widely used in various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayra Russo, Maria-Esther Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) systems are capable of reproducing and often amplifying undesired biases. This puts emphasis on the importance of operating under practices that enable the study and understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of ML pipelines, prompting the emergence of documentation frameworks with the idea that ``any remedy for bias starts with awareness of its existence''. However, a resource that can formally describe these pipelines in terms of biases detected is still amiss. To fill this gap, we present the Doc-BiasO ontology, a resource that aims to create an integrated vocabulary of biases defined in the \textit{fair-ML} literature and their measures, as well as to incorporate relevant terminology and the relationships between them. Overseeing ontology engineering best practices, we re-use existing vocabulary on machine learning and AI, to foster knowledge sharing and interoperability between the actors concerned with its research, development, regulation, among others. Overall, our main objective is to contribute towards clarifying existing terminology on bias research as it rapidly expands to all areas of AI and to improve the interpretation of bias in data and downstream impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward McDaid, Sarah McDaid</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction subsets are heuristics that can reduce the size of the inductive programming search space by tens of orders of magnitude. Comprising many overlapping subsets of different sizes, they serve as predictions of the instructions required to code a solution for any problem. Currently, this approach employs a single, large family of subsets meaning that some problems can search thousands of subsets before a solution is found. In this paper we introduce the use of test case type signatures as hyper-heuristics to select one of many, smaller families of instruction subsets. The type signature for any set of test cases maps directly to a single family and smaller families mean that fewer subsets need to be considered for most problems. Having many families also permits subsets to be reordered to better reflect their relative occurrence in human code - again reducing the search space size for many problems. Overall the new approach can further reduce the size of the inductive programming search space by between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, depending on the type signature. Larger and more consistent reductions are possible through the use of more sophisticated type systems. The potential use of additional test case features as hyper-heuristics and some other possible future work is also briefly discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yexin Li, Zhancun Mu, Siyuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective negotiation strategies poses two key challenges: the exploration-exploitation dilemma and dealing with large action spaces. However, there is an absence of learning-based approaches that effectively address these challenges in negotiation. This paper introduces a comprehensive formulation to tackle various negotiation problems. Our approach leverages contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandits, with the bandits resolving the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and the combinatorial nature handles large action spaces. Building upon this formulation, we introduce NegUCB, a novel method that also handles common issues such as partial observations and complex reward functions in negotiation. NegUCB is contextual and tailored for full-bandit feedback without constraints on the reward functions. Under mild assumptions, it ensures a sub-linear regret upper bound. Experiments conducted on three negotiation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shian Du, Xiaotian Cheng, Qi Qian, Henglu Wei, Yi Xu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation has attracted unprecedented attention in the recent few years due to its unique capability of generating highly-personalized images via using the input concept dataset and novel textual prompt. However, previous methods solely focus on the performance of the reconstruction task, degrading its ability to combine with different textual prompt. Besides, optimizing in the high-dimensional embedding space usually leads to unnecessary time-consuming training process and slow convergence. To address these issues, we propose an efficient method to explore the target embedding in a textual subspace, drawing inspiration from the self-expressiveness property. Additionally, we propose an efficient selection strategy for determining the basis vectors of the textual subspace. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the learned embedding can not only faithfully reconstruct input image, but also significantly improves its alignment with novel input textual prompt. Furthermore, we observe that optimizing in the textual subspace leads to an significant improvement of the robustness to the initial word, relaxing the constraint that requires users to input the most relevant initial word. Our method opens the door to more efficient representation learning for personalized text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gihun Lee, Minchan Jeong, Yujin Kim, Hojung Jung, Jaehoon Oh, Sangmook Kim, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: While learning to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences has shown remarkable success, aligning these models to meet the diverse user preferences presents further challenges in preserving previous knowledge. This paper examines the impact of personalized preference optimization on LLMs, revealing that the extent of knowledge loss varies significantly with preference heterogeneity. Although previous approaches have utilized the KL constraint between the reference model and the policy model, we observe that they fail to maintain general knowledge and alignment when facing personalized preferences. To this end, we introduce Base-Anchored Preference Optimization (BAPO), a simple yet effective approach that utilizes the initial responses of reference model to mitigate forgetting while accommodating personalized alignment. BAPO effectively adapts to diverse user preferences while minimally affecting global knowledge or general alignment. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BAPO in various setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Poesia, David Broman, Nick Haber, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: How did humanity coax mathematics from the aether? We explore the Platonic view that mathematics can be discovered from its axioms - a game of conjecture and proof. We describe Minimo (Mathematics from Intrinsic Motivation): an agent that jointly learns to pose challenging problems for itself (conjecturing) and solve them (theorem proving). Given a mathematical domain axiomatized in dependent type theory, we first combine methods for constrained decoding and type-directed synthesis to sample valid conjectures from a language model. Our method guarantees well-formed conjectures by construction, even as we start with a randomly initialized model. We use the same model to represent a policy and value function for guiding proof search. Our agent targets generating hard but provable conjectures - a moving target, since its own theorem proving ability also improves as it trains. We propose novel methods for hindsight relabeling on proof search trees to significantly improve the agent's sample efficiency in both tasks. Experiments on 3 axiomatic domains (propositional logic, arithmetic and group theory) demonstrate that our agent can bootstrap from only the axioms, self-improving in generating true and challenging conjectures and in finding proofs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianuo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent advancements in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), its application has extended to various safety-critical scenarios. However, most methods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when deployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an innovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm. This approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents through risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is grounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory generation. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further ensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL benchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to stringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to existing methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in advancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Torresan, Manuel Baltieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex adaptive agents consistently achieve their goals by solving problems that seem to require an understanding of causal information, information pertaining to the causal relationships that exist among elements of combined agent-environment systems. Causal cognition studies and describes the main characteristics of causal learning and reasoning in human and non-human animals, offering a conceptual framework to discuss cognitive performances based on the level of apparent causal understanding of a task. Despite the use of formal intervention-based models of causality, including causal Bayesian networks, psychological and behavioural research on causal cognition does not yet offer a computational account that operationalises how agents acquire a causal understanding of the world. Machine and reinforcement learning research on causality, especially involving disentanglement as a candidate process to build causal representations, represent on the one hand a concrete attempt at designing causal artificial agents that can shed light on the inner workings of natural causal cognition. In this work, we connect these two areas of research to build a unifying framework for causal cognition that will offer a computational perspective on studies of animal cognition, and provide insights in the development of new algorithms for causal reinforcement learning in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geigh Zollicoffer, Kshitij Bhatta, Manish Bhattarai, Phil Romero, Christian F. A. Negre, Anders M. N. Niklasson, Adetokunbo Adedoyin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce innovative approaches for accelerating the Jacobi method for matrix diagonalization, specifically through the formulation of large matrix diagonalization as a Semi-Markov Decision Process and small matrix diagonalization as a Markov Decision Process. Furthermore, we examine the potential of utilizing scalable architecture between different-sized matrices. During a short training period, our method discovered a significant reduction in the number of steps required for diagonalization and exhibited efficient inference capabilities. Importantly, this approach demonstrated possible scalability to large-sized matrices, indicating its potential for wide-ranging applicability. Upon training completion, we obtain action-state probabilities and transition graphs, which depict transitions between different states. These outputs not only provide insights into the diagonalization process but also pave the way for cost savings pertinent to large-scale matrices. The advancements made in this research enhance the efficacy and scalability of matrix diagonalization, pushing for new possibilities for deployment in practical applications in scientific and engineering domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliott Thornley, Alexander Roman, Christos Ziakas, Leyton Ho, Louis Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Some worry that advanced artificial agents may resist being shut down. The Incomplete Preferences Proposal (IPP) is an idea for ensuring that doesn't happen. A key part of the IPP is using a novel 'Discounted REward for Same-Length Trajectories (DREST)' reward function to train agents to (1) pursue goals effectively conditional on each trajectory-length (be 'USEFUL'), and (2) choose stochastically between different trajectory-lengths (be 'NEUTRAL' about trajectory-lengths). In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for USEFULNESS and NEUTRALITY. We use a DREST reward function to train simple agents to navigate gridworlds, and we find that these agents learn to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our results thus suggest that DREST reward functions could also train advanced agents to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL, and thereby make these advanced agents useful and shutdownable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliyah R. Hsu, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri, Anobel Y. Odisho, Peter R. Carroll, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit impressive capabilities but are often regarded as black boxes due to challenges in understanding the complex nonlinear relationships between features. Interpreting machine learning models is of paramount importance to mitigate risks, and mechanistic interpretability is in particular of current interest as it opens up a window for guiding manual modifications and reverse-engineering solutions. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T), extending a prior work on CD for RNNs and CNNs, to address mechanistic interpretation computationally efficiently. CD-T is a flexible interpretation method for transformers. It can capture contributions of combinations of input features or source internal components (e.g. attention heads, feed-forward networks) to (1) final predictions or (2) the output of any target internal component. Using CD-T, we propose a novel algorithm for circuit discovery. On a real-world pathology report classification task: we show CD-T distills a more faithful circuit of attention heads with improved computational efficiency (speed up 2x) than a prior benchmark, path patching. As a versatile interpretation method, CD-T also exhibits exceptional capabilities for local interpretations. CD-T is shown to reliably find words and phrases of contrasting sentiment/topic on SST-2 and AGNews datasets. Through human experiments, we demonstrate CD-T enables users to identify the more accurate of two models and to better trust a model's outputs compared to alternative interpretation methods such as SHAP and LIME.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhra Mishra, Gabriel Poesia, Belinda Mo, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is an important skill for Large Language Models (LLMs), both as an important capability and a proxy for a range of reasoning abilities. Existing benchmarks probe a diverse set of skills, but they yield aggregate accuracy metrics, obscuring specific abilities or weaknesses. Furthermore, they are difficult to extend with new problems, risking data contamination over time. To address these challenges, we propose MathCAMPS: a method to synthesize high-quality mathematical problems at scale, grounded on 44 fine-grained "standards" from the Mathematics Common Core (CC) Standard for K-8 grades. We encode each standard in a formal grammar, allowing us to sample diverse symbolic problems and their answers. We then use LLMs to realize the symbolic problems into word problems. We propose a cycle-consistency method for validating problem faithfulness. Finally, we derive follow-up questions from symbolic structures and convert them into follow-up word problems - a novel task of mathematical dialogue that probes for robustness in understanding. Experiments on 23 LLMs show surprising failures even in the strongest models (in particular when asked simple follow-up questions). Moreover, we evaluate training checkpoints of Pythia 12B on MathCAMPS, allowing us to analyze when particular mathematical skills develop during its training. Our framework enables the community to reproduce and extend our pipeline for a fraction of the typical cost of building new high-quality datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Tian, Boyi Li, Xinshuo Weng, Yuxiao Chen, Edward Schmerling, Yue Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving industry is increasingly adopting end-to-end learning from sensory inputs to minimize human biases in system design. Traditional end-to-end driving models, however, suffer from long-tail events due to rare or unseen inputs within their training distributions. To address this, we propose TOKEN, a novel Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) that tokenizes the world into object-level knowledge, enabling better utilization of LLM's reasoning capabilities to enhance autonomous vehicle planning in long-tail scenarios. TOKEN effectively alleviates data scarcity and inefficient tokenization by leveraging a traditional end-to-end driving model to produce condensed and semantically enriched representations of the scene, which are optimized for LLM planning compatibility through deliberate representation and reasoning alignment training stages. Our results demonstrate that TOKEN excels in grounding, reasoning, and planning capabilities, outperforming existing frameworks with a 27% reduction in trajectory L2 error and a 39% decrease in collision rates in long-tail scenarios. Additionally, our work highlights the importance of representation alignment and structured reasoning in sparking the common-sense reasoning capabilities of MM-LLMs for effective planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Su, Jinbo Wen, Jiawen Kang, Yonghua Wang, Hudan Pan, M. Shamim Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. The advancement of generative artificial intelligence has positioned Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as crucial tools for managing healthcare data. MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However, critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including healthcare data security and freshness issues, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLMs framework for healthcare data management. This framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs. Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare data holders to share fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry in data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canjie Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, self-driving cars have become a central focus in the development of future transportation systems. Scenario generation technology has emerged as a crucial tool for testing and verifying the safety performance of autonomous driving systems. Current research in scenario generation primarily focuses on open roads such as highways, with relatively limited studies on underground parking garages. The unique structural constraints, insufficient lighting, and high-density obstacles in underground parking garages impose greater demands on the perception systems, which are critical to autonomous driving technology.
  This study proposes an accelerated generation method for perception failure scenarios tailored to the underground parking garage environment, aimed at testing and improving the safety performance of autonomous vehicle (AV) perception algorithms in such settings. The method presented in this paper generates an intelligent testing environment with a high density of perception failure scenarios by learning the interactions between background vehicles (BVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) within perception failure scenarios. Furthermore, this method edits the Markov process within the perception failure scenario data to increase the density of critical information in the training data, thereby optimizing the learning and generation of perception failure scenarios. A simulation environment for an underground parking garage was developed using the Carla and Vissim platforms, with Bevfusion employed as the perception algorithm for testing. The study demonstrates that this method can generate an intelligent testing environment with a high density of perception failure scenarios and enhance the safety performance of perception algorithms within this experimental setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihan Deng, Weikai Xu, Hongda Sun, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Jianfeng Liu, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Rui Yan, Shuo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have become a research hotspot in human-computer interaction. However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation metric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach essential points during their planning and reasoning steps.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, FRoG, for fuzzy reasoning, featuring real-world mathematical word problems that incorporate generalized quantifiers.

Additionally, our results show an inverse scaling effect in the performance of LLMs on FRoG. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that strong mathematical reasoning skills are not necessarily indicative of success on our benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: The conceptualization and categorization of natural objects in the human mind have long intrigued cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, offering crucial insights into human perception and cognition. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the attractive question of whether these models can also develop human-like object representations through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic and multimodal data. In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analysis methods to uncover how the object concept representations in LLMs correlate with those of humans. By collecting large-scale datasets of 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLM and Multimodal LLM (MLLM), we were able to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the underlying similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were found to be highly stable and predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering akin to human mental representations. Interestingly, the interpretability of the dimensions underlying these embeddings suggests that LLM and MLLM have developed human-like conceptual representations of natural objects. Further analysis demonstrated strong alignment between the identified model embeddings and neural activity patterns in many functionally defined brain ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC and FFA). This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reflect key schemas of human conceptual knowledge. This study advances our understanding of machine intelligence and informs the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart home environments enables several applications in the areas of energy management, safety, well-being, and healthcare. ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained. Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyue Fu, Hao Guan, Kounianhua Du, Jianghao Lin, Wei Xia, Weinan Zhang, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to determine whether students will respond correctly to the next question, which is a crucial task in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often face severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between individual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts consistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only implicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking direct modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware Inductive Knowledge Tracing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for the first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive knowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs, SINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT predicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the student's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art performance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore the performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into various modules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual mathematical reasoning, as a fundamental visual reasoning ability, has received widespread attention from the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) community. Existing benchmarks, such as MathVista and MathVerse, focus more on the result-oriented performance but neglect the underlying principles in knowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond end-to-end performance. We meticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and five layers of knowledge granularity. We decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM), to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs' reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving steps and problem-specific performance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation strategies. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization - they correctly solve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts yet fail to answer sub-problems. We anticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for advancements in visual mathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles need to travel over 11 billion miles to ensure their safety. Therefore, the importance of simulation testing before real-world testing is self-evident. In recent years, the release of 3D simulators for autonomous driving, represented by Carla and CarSim, marks the transition of autonomous driving simulation testing environments from simple 2D overhead views to complex 3D models. During simulation testing, experimenters need to build static scenes and dynamic traffic flows, pedestrian flows, and other experimental elements to construct experimental scenarios. When building static scenes in 3D simulators, experimenters often need to manually construct 3D models, set parameters and attributes, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This thesis proposes an automated program generation framework. Based on deep reinforcement learning, this framework can generate different 2D ground script codes, on which 3D model files and map model files are built. The generated 3D ground scenes are displayed in the Carla simulator, where experimenters can use this scene for navigation algorithm simulation testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work.

<p>Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 100 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the best completion ratio of 35.26%. All framework code, agent code, and task datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/camel-ai/crab.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Ma, Huamin Wang, Hangchi Shen, Xuemei Chen, Shukai Duan, Shiping Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted great research attention owing to their inherent bio-interpretability, event-triggered properties and powerful perception of spatiotemporal information, which is beneficial to handling event-based neuromorphic datasets. In contrast to conventional static image datasets, event-based neuromorphic datasets present heightened complexity in feature extraction due to their distinctive time series and sparsity characteristics, which influences their classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach termed Neuromorphic Momentum Contrast Learning (NeuroMoCo) for SNNs is introduced in this paper by extending the benefits of self-supervised pre-training to SNNs to effectively stimulate their potential. This is the first time that self-supervised learning (SSL) based on momentum contrastive learning is realized in SNNs. In addition, we devise a novel loss function named MixInfoNCE tailored to their temporal characteristics to further increase the classification accuracy of neuromorphic datasets, which is verified through rigorous ablation experiments. Finally, experiments on DVS-CIFAR10, DVS128Gesture and N-Caltech101 have shown that NeuroMoCo of this paper establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks: 83.6% (Spikformer-2-256), 98.62% (Spikformer-2-256), and 84.4% (SEW-ResNet-18), respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Noori, I\~naki Arango, William E. Byrd, Nada Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: The strict selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the most formidable challenges to successful central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery. Computational methods to generate BBB permeable drugs in silico may be valuable tools in the CNS drug design pipeline. However, in real-world applications, BBB penetration alone is insufficient; rather, after transiting the BBB, molecules must bind to a specific target or receptor in the brain and must also be safe and non-toxic. To discover small molecules that concurrently satisfy these constraints, we use multi-objective generative AI to synthesize drug-like BBB-permeable small molecules. Specifically, we computationally synthesize molecules with predicted binding affinity against dopamine receptor D2, the primary target for many clinically effective antipsychotic drugs. After training several graph neural network-based property predictors, we adapt SyntheMol (Swanson et al., 2024), a recently developed Monte Carlo Tree Search-based algorithm for antibiotic design, to perform a multi-objective guided traversal over an easily synthesizable molecular space. We design a library of 26,581 novel and diverse small molecules containing hits with high predicted BBB permeability and favorable predicted safety and toxicity profiles, and that could readily be synthesized for experimental validation in the wet lab. We also validate top scoring molecules with molecular docking simulation against the D2 receptor and demonstrate predicted binding affinity on par with risperidone, a clinically prescribed D2-targeting antipsychotic. In the future, the SyntheMol-based computational approach described here may enable the discovery of novel neurotherapeutics for currently intractable disorders of the CNS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grant Wilkins, Srinivasan Keshav, Richard Mortier</p>
<p>Abstract: Both the training and use of Large Language Models (LLMs) require large amounts of energy. Their increasing popularity, therefore, raises critical concerns regarding the energy efficiency and sustainability of data centers that host them. This paper addresses the challenge of reducing energy consumption in data centers running LLMs. We propose a hybrid data center model that uses a cost-based scheduling framework to dynamically allocate LLM tasks across hardware accelerators that differ in their energy efficiencies and computational capabilities. Specifically, our workload-aware strategy determines whether tasks are processed on energy-efficient processors or high-performance GPUs based on the number of input and output tokens in a query. Our analysis of a representative LLM dataset, finds that this hybrid strategy can reduce CPU+GPU energy consumption by 7.5% compared to a workload-unaware baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feibo Jiang, Chuanguo Tang, Li Dong, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) has emerged as a novel communication paradigm in recent years, successfully transcending the Shannon physical capacity limits through innovative semantic transmission concepts. Nevertheless, extant Image Semantic Communication (ISC) systems face several challenges in dynamic environments, including low semantic density, catastrophic forgetting, and uncertain Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). To address these challenges, we propose a novel Vision-Language Model-based Cross-modal Semantic Communication (VLM-CSC) system. The VLM-CSC comprises three novel components: (1) Cross-modal Knowledge Base (CKB) is used to extract high-density textual semantics from the semantically sparse image at the transmitter and reconstruct the original image based on textual semantics at the receiver. The transmission of high-density semantics contributes to alleviating bandwidth pressure. (2) Memory-assisted Encoder and Decoder (MED) employ a hybrid long/short-term memory mechanism, enabling the semantic encoder and decoder to overcome catastrophic forgetting in dynamic environments when there is a drift in the distribution of semantic features. (3) Noise Attention Module (NAM) employs attention mechanisms to adaptively adjust the semantic coding and the channel coding based on SNR, ensuring the robustness of the CSC system. The experimental simulations validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of the CSC system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depression can significantly impact many aspects of an individual's life, including their personal and social functioning, academic and work performance, and overall quality of life. Many researchers within the field of affective computing are adopting deep learning technology to explore potential patterns related to the detection of depression. However, because of subjects' privacy protection concerns, that data in this area is still scarce, presenting a challenge for the deep discriminative models used in detecting depression. To navigate these obstacles, a large-scale multimodal vlog dataset (LMVD), for depression recognition in the wild is built. In LMVD, which has 1823 samples with 214 hours of the 1475 participants captured from four multimedia platforms (Sina Weibo, Bilibili, Tiktok, and YouTube). A novel architecture termed MDDformer to learn the non-verbal behaviors of individuals is proposed. Extensive validations are performed on the LMVD dataset, demonstrating superior performance for depression detection. We anticipate that the LMVD will contribute a valuable function to the depression detection community. The data and code will released at the link: https://github.com/helang818/LMVD/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohai Trabelsi, Pan Xu, Sarit Kraus</p>
<p>Abstract: Assigning tasks to service providers is a frequent procedure across various applications. Often the tasks arrive dynamically while the service providers remain static. Preventing task rejection caused by service provider overload is of utmost significance. To ensure a positive experience in relevant applications for both service providers and tasks, fairness must be considered. To address the issue, we model the problem as an online matching within a bipartite graph and tackle two minimax problems: one focuses on minimizing the highest waiting time of a task, while the other aims to minimize the highest workload of a service provider. We show that the second problem can be expressed as a linear program and thus solved efficiently while maintaining a reasonable approximation to the objective of the first problem. We developed novel methods that utilize the two minimax problems. We conducted extensive simulation experiments using real data and demonstrated that our novel heuristics, based on the linear program, performed remarkably well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youzhi Qu, Junfeng Xia, Xinyao Jian, Wendu Li, Kaining Peng, Zhichao Liang, Haiyan Wu, Quanying Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data reconstruction is a widely used pre-training task to learn the generalized features for many downstream tasks. Although reconstruction tasks have been applied to neural signal completion and denoising, neural signal reconstruction is less studied. Here, we employ the masked autoencoder (MAE) model to reconstruct functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and utilize a transfer learning framework to obtain the cognitive taskonomy, a matrix to quantify the similarity between cognitive tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the MAE model effectively captures the temporal dynamics patterns and interactions within the brain regions, enabling robust cross-subject fMRI signal reconstruction. The cognitive taskonomy derived from the transfer learning framework reveals the relationships among cognitive tasks, highlighting subtask correlations within motor tasks and similarities between emotion, social, and gambling tasks. Our study suggests that the fMRI reconstruction with MAE model can uncover the latent representation and the obtained taskonomy offers guidance for selecting source tasks in neural decoding tasks for improving the decoding performance on target tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing reliance on computer systems, particularly personal computers (PCs), necessitates heightened reliability to uphold user satisfaction. This research paper presents an in-depth analysis of extensive system telemetry data, proposing an ensemble methodology for detecting system failures. Our approach entails scrutinizing various parameters of system metrics, encompassing CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk activity, CPU temperature, and pertinent system metadata such as system age, usage patterns, core count, and processor type. The proposed ensemble technique integrates a diverse set of algorithms, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, isolation forests, one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), and local outlier factors (LOF), to effectively discern system failures. Specifically, the LSTM network with other machine learning techniques is trained on Intel Computing Improvement Program (ICIP) telemetry software data to distinguish between normal and failed system patterns. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our models, achieving a notable detection rate in identifying system failures. Our research contributes to advancing the field of system reliability and offers practical insights for enhancing user experience in computing environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The equivalent nature of 3D coordinates has posed long term challenges in protein structure representation learning, alignment, and generation. Can we create a compact and invariant language that equivalently represents protein structures? Towards this goal, we propose FoldToken2 to transfer equivariant structures into discrete tokens, while maintaining the recoverability of the original structures. From FoldToken1 to FoldToken2, we improve three key components: (1) invariant structure encoder, (2) vector-quantized compressor, and (3) equivalent structure decoder. We evaluate FoldToken2 on the protein structure reconstruction task and show that it outperforms previous FoldToken1 by 20\% in TMScore and 81\% in RMSD. FoldToken2 probably be the first method that works well on both single-chain and multi-chain protein structures quantization. We believe that FoldToken2 will inspire further improvement in protein structure representation learning, structure alignment, and structure generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Deng, Shiyao Wang, Yuchen Wang, Jiansong Qi, Liqin Zhao, Guorui Zhou, Gaofeng Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Live streaming services are becoming increasingly popular due to real-time interactions and entertainment. Viewers can chat and send comments or virtual gifts to express their preferences for the streamers. Accurately modeling the gifting interaction not only enhances users' experience but also increases streamers' revenue. Previous studies on live streaming gifting prediction treat this task as a conventional recommendation problem, and model users' preferences using categorical data and observed historical behaviors. However, it is challenging to precisely describe the real-time content changes in live streaming using limited categorical information. Moreover, due to the sparsity of gifting behaviors, capturing the preferences and intentions of users is quite difficult. In this work, we propose MMBee based on real-time Multi-Modal Fusion and Behaviour Expansion to address these issues. Specifically, we first present a Multi-modal Fusion Module with Learnable Query (MFQ) to perceive the dynamic content of streaming segments and process complex multi-modal interactions, including images, text comments and speech. To alleviate the sparsity issue of gifting behaviors, we present a novel Graph-guided Interest Expansion (GIE) approach that learns both user and streamer representations on large-scale gifting graphs with multi-modal attributes. Comprehensive experiment results show that MMBee achieves significant performance improvements on both public datasets and Kuaishou real-world streaming datasets and the effectiveness has been further validated through online A/B experiments. MMBee has been deployed and is serving hundreds of millions of users at Kuaishou.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Serra, Peter Tino, Zhao Xu, Xin Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are widely adopted in many applications, including recommender systems. Given the sparse and stochastic nature of collaborative filtering (CF) data, recent works have critically analyzed the effective improvement of neural-based approaches compared to simpler and often transparent algorithms for recommendation. Previous results showed that NN and DL models can be outperformed by traditional algorithms in many tasks. Moreover, given the largely black-box nature of neural-based methods, interpretable results are not naturally obtained. Following on this debate, we first present a transparent probabilistic model that topologically organizes user and product latent classes based on the review information. In contrast to popular neural techniques for representation learning, we readily obtain a statistical, visualization-friendly tool that can be easily inspected to understand user and product characteristics from a textual-based perspective. Then, given the limitations of common embedding techniques, we investigate the possibility of using the estimated interpretable quantities as model input for a rating prediction task. To contribute to the recent debates, we evaluate our results in terms of both capacity for interpretability and predictive performances in comparison with popular text-based neural approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed latent class representations can yield competitive predictive performances, compared to popular, but difficult-to-interpret approaches.</p>

Our approach combines LLMs for symbolic regression with dimensional analysis via prompt engineering and offers students a unique perspective to comprehend relationships between physics variables. This fosters a broader and more versatile understanding of physics and mathematical principles and complements a conventional undergraduate physics education that relies on interpreting and applying established equations within specific contexts. We test our personalized learning tool on the equations from Feynman's lectures on physics. Our tool can correctly identify relationships between physics variables for most equations, underscoring its value as a complementary personalized learning tool for undergraduate physics students.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRA adapters. We consider compressing adapters individually via SVD and propose a method for joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 75% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: While multivariate logistic regression classifiers are a great way of implementing collaborative filtering - a method of making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many other users, we can also achieve similar results using neural networks. A recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. A perceptron or a neural network is a machine learning model designed for fitting complex datasets using backpropagation and gradient descent. When coupled with advanced optimization techniques, the model may prove to be a great substitute for classical logistic classifiers. The optimizations include feature scaling, mean normalization, regularization, hyperparameter tuning and using stochastic/mini-batch gradient descent instead of regular gradient descent. In this use case, we will use the perceptron in the recommender system to fit the parameters i.e., the data from a multitude of users and use it to predict the preference/interest of a particular user.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the context of emerging 6G services, the realization of everything-to-everything interactions involving a myriad of physical and digital entities presents a crucial challenge. This challenge is exacerbated by resource scarcity in communication infrastructures, necessitating innovative solutions for effective service implementation. Exploring the potential of Semantic Communications (SemCom) to enhance point-to-point physical layer efficiency shows great promise in addressing this challenge. However, achieving efficient SemCom requires overcoming the significant hurdle of knowledge sharing between semantic decoders and encoders, particularly in the dynamic and non-stationary environment with stringent end-to-end quality requirements. To bridge this gap in existing literature, this paper introduces the Knowledge Base Management And Orchestration (KB-MANO) framework. Rooted in the concepts of Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) and lifelong learning, KB-MANO is crafted for the allocation of network and computing resources dedicated to updating and redistributing KBs across the system. The primary objective is to minimize the impact of knowledge management activities on actual service provisioning. A proof-of-concept is proposed to showcase the integration of KB-MANO with resource allocation in radio access networks. Finally, the paper offers insights into future research directions, emphasizing the transformative potential of semantic-oriented communication systems in the realm of 6G technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Chen Zhu, Xiao Hu, Chuan Qin, Xiangyu Zhao, Hengshu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Job recommender systems are crucial for aligning job opportunities with job-seekers in online job-seeking. However, users tend to adjust their job preferences to secure employment opportunities continually, which limits the performance of job recommendations. The inherent frequency of preference drift poses a challenge to promptly and precisely capture user preferences. To address this issue, we propose a novel session-based framework, BISTRO, to timely model user preference through fusion learning of semantic and behavioral information. Specifically, BISTRO is composed of three stages: 1) coarse-grained semantic clustering, 2) fine-grained job preference extraction, and 3) personalized top-$k$ job recommendation. Initially, BISTRO segments the user interaction sequence into sessions and leverages session-based semantic clustering to achieve broad identification of person-job matching. Subsequently, we design a hypergraph wavelet learning method to capture the nuanced job preference drift. To mitigate the effect of noise in interactions caused by frequent preference drift, we innovatively propose an adaptive wavelet filtering technique to remove noisy interaction. Finally, a recurrent neural network is utilized to analyze session-based interaction for inferring personalized preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world offline recruitment datasets demonstrate the significant performances of our framework. Significantly, BISTRO also excels in online experiments, affirming its effectiveness in live recruitment settings. This dual success underscores the robustness and adaptability of BISTRO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Wei, Shijie Cao, Ting Cao, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Yanyong Zhang, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important to enhance on-device intelligence. Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead.
  In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution.
  Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Zhou, Wei Ye, Yidong Wang, Chaoya Jiang, Zhemg Lee, Rui Xie, Shikun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) enables large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to make predictions for unseen inputs without updating parameters. Despite its potential, ICL's effectiveness heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and permutation of demonstrations, commonly leading to suboptimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we tackle this challenge for the first time from the perspective of demonstration augmentation. Specifically, we start with enriching representations of demonstrations by leveraging their deep feature distribution. We then theoretically reveal that when the number of augmented copies approaches infinity, the augmentation is approximately equal to a novel logit calibration mechanism integrated with specific statistical properties. This insight results in a simple yet highly efficient method that significantly improves the average and worst-case accuracy across diverse PLMs and tasks. Moreover, our method effectively reduces performance variance among varying demonstrations, permutations, and templates, and displays the capability to address imbalanced class distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Sudhirbhai Vora, Dhrumil Chetankumar Joshi, Aksh Kantibhai Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent is used for large datasets to train models to reduce the training time. On top of that data parallelism is widely used as a method to efficiently train neural networks using multiple worker nodes in parallel. Synchronous and asynchronous approach to data parallelism is used by most systems to train the model in parallel. However, both of them have their drawbacks. We propose a third approach to data parallelism which is a hybrid between synchronous and asynchronous approaches, using both approaches to train the neural network. When the threshold function is selected appropriately to gradually shift all parameter aggregation from asynchronous to synchronous, we show that in a given time period our hybrid approach outperforms both asynchronous and synchronous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Wu, Fang Meng, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have generated significant interest in the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Visual instruction tuning of MLLMs with machine-generated instruction-following data has shown to enhance zero-shot capabilities across various tasks. However, there has been limited exploration into controlling the quality of the instruction data.Current methodologies for data selection in MLLMs often rely on single, unreliable scores or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential overfitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data selection methodology that utilizes image-text correlation and model perplexity to evaluate and select data of varying quality. This approach leverages the distinct distribution of these two attributes, mapping data quality into a two-dimensional space that allows for the selection of data based on their location within this distribution. By utilizing this space, we can analyze the impact of task type settings, used as prompts, on data quality. Additionally, this space can be used to construct multi-stage subsets of varying quality to facilitate curriculum learning. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in five commonly assessed capabilities compared to using the complete dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Matas, Carmen Serrano, Francisca Silva, Amalia Serrano, Tom\'as Toledo-Pastrana, Bego\~na Acha</p>
<p>Abstract: An AI tool has been developed to provide interpretable support for the diagnosis of BCC via teledermatology, thus speeding up referrals and optimizing resource utilization. The interpretability is provided in two ways: on the one hand, the main BCC dermoscopic patterns are found in the image to justify the BCC/Non BCC classification. Secondly, based on the common visual XAI Grad-CAM, a clinically inspired visual explanation is developed where the relevant features for diagnosis are located. Since there is no established ground truth for BCC dermoscopic features, a standard reference is inferred from the diagnosis of four dermatologists using an Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and interpretability, positioning this approach as a valuable tool for early BCC detection and referral to dermatologists. The BCC/non-BCC classification achieved an accuracy rate of 90%. For Clinically-inspired XAI results, the detection of BCC patterns useful to clinicians reaches 99% accuracy. As for the Clinically-inspired Visual XAI results, the mean of the Grad-CAM normalized value within the manually segmented clinical features is 0.57, while outside this region it is 0.16. This indicates that the model struggles to accurately identify the regions of the BCC patterns. These results prove the ability of the AI tool to provide a useful explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Qian, Ziyu Zheng, Prayag Tiwari, Yijie Ding, Quan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug-side effect prediction has become an essential area of research in the field of pharmacology. As the use of medications continues to rise, so does the importance of understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with them. At present, researchers have turned to data-driven methods to predict drug-side effects. Drug-side effect prediction is a link prediction problem, and the related data can be described from various perspectives. To process these kinds of data, a multi-view method, called Multiple Kronecker RLS fusion-based link propagation (MKronRLSF-LP), is proposed. MKronRLSF-LP extends the Kron-RLS by finding the consensus partitions and multiple graph Laplacian constraints in the multi-view setting. Both of these multi-view settings contribute to a higher quality result. Extensive experiments have been conducted on drug-side effect datasets, and our empirical results provide evidence that our approach is effective and robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Eleni Triantafillou, Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Nicolas Papernot, Matthew Jagielski, Itay Yona, Heidi Howard, Eugene Bagdasaryan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exact unlearning was first introduced as a privacy mechanism that allowed a user to retract their data from machine learning models on request. Shortly after, inexact schemes were proposed to mitigate the impractical costs associated with exact unlearning. More recently unlearning is often discussed as an approach for removal of impermissible knowledge i.e. knowledge that the model should not possess such as unlicensed copyrighted, inaccurate, or malicious information. The promise is that if the model does not have a certain malicious capability, then it cannot be used for the associated malicious purpose. In this paper we revisit the paradigm in which unlearning is used for in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlight an underlying inconsistency arising from in-context learning. Unlearning can be an effective control mechanism for the training phase, yet it does not prevent the model from performing an impermissible act during inference. We introduce a concept of ununlearning, where unlearned knowledge gets reintroduced in-context, effectively rendering the model capable of behaving as if it knows the forgotten knowledge. As a result, we argue that content filtering for impermissible knowledge will be required and even exact unlearning schemes are not enough for effective content regulation. We discuss feasibility of ununlearning for modern LLMs and examine broader implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incorporating extra-textual context such as film metadata into the machine translation (MT) pipeline can enhance translation quality, as indicated by automatic evaluation in recent work. However, the positive impact of such systems in industry remains unproven. We report on an industrial case study carried out to investigate the benefit of MT in a professional scenario of translating TV subtitles with a focus on how leveraging extra-textual context impacts post-editing. We found that post-editors marked significantly fewer context-related errors when correcting the outputs of MTCue, the context-aware model, as opposed to non-contextual models. We also present the results of a survey of the employed post-editors, which highlights contextual inadequacy as a significant gap consistently observed in MT. Our findings strengthen the motivation for further work within fully contextual MT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Doosthosseini, Jonathan Decker, Hendrik Nolte, Julian M. Kunkel</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has created a pressing need for an efficient, secure and private serving infrastructure, which allows researchers to run open-source or custom fine-tuned LLMs and ensures users that their data remains private and is not stored without their consent. While high-performance computing (HPC) systems equipped with state-of-the-art GPUs are well-suited for training LLMs, their batch scheduling paradigm is not designed to support real-time serving of AI applications. Cloud systems, on the other hand, are well suited for web services but commonly lack access to the computational power of clusters, especially expensive and scarce high-end GPUs, which are required for optimal inference speed. We propose an architecture with an implementation consisting of a web service that runs on a cloud VM with secure access to a scalable backend running a multitude of AI models on HPC systems. By offering a web service using our HPC infrastructure to host LLMs, we leverage the trusted environment of local universities and research centers to offer a private and secure alternative to commercial LLM services. Our solution natively integrates with Slurm, enabling seamless deployment on HPC clusters and is able to run side by side with regular Slurm workloads, while utilizing gaps in the schedule created by Slurm. In order to ensure the security of the HPC system, we use the SSH ForceCommand directive to construct a robust circuit breaker, which prevents successful attacks on the web-facing server from affecting the cluster. We have successfully deployed our system as a production service, and made the source code available at https://github.com/gwdg/chat-ai</p>

We achieved accurate predictions for a range of affinity values associated with ligand-protein interactions on out-of-sample data in a zero-shot setting. Only the SMILES string of the ligand and the amino acid sequence of the protein were used as the model inputs. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over machine learning (ML) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+) based methods in accurately predicting a range of ligand-protein interaction affinities, which can be leveraged to further accelerate drug discovery campaigns against challenging therapeutic targets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yu, Xin Yang, Xin Gao, Yan Kang, Hao Wang, Junbo Zhang, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized Federated Continual Learning (PFCL) is a new practical scenario that poses greater challenges in sharing and personalizing knowledge. PFCL not only relies on knowledge fusion for server aggregation at the global spatial-temporal perspective but also needs model improvement for each client according to the local requirements. Existing methods, whether in Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) or Federated Continual Learning (FCL), have overlooked the multi-granularity representation of knowledge, which can be utilized to overcome Spatial-Temporal Catastrophic Forgetting (STCF) and adopt generalized knowledge to itself by coarse-to-fine human cognitive mechanisms. Moreover, it allows more effectively to personalized shared knowledge, thus serving its own purpose. To this end, we propose a novel concept called multi-granularity prompt, i.e., coarse-grained global prompt acquired through the common model learning process, and fine-grained local prompt used to personalize the generalized representation. The former focuses on efficiently transferring shared global knowledge without spatial forgetting, and the latter emphasizes specific learning of personalized local knowledge to overcome temporal forgetting. In addition, we design a selective prompt fusion mechanism for aggregating knowledge of global prompts distilled from different clients. By the exclusive fusion of coarse-grained knowledge, we achieve the transmission and refinement of common knowledge among clients, further enhancing the performance of personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing STCF as well as improving personalized performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Zhancun Mu, Haowei Lin, Ceyao Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Qing Li, Anji Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in open-world Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau$ = {$o_0$, $a_0$, $\dots$} and an imitation learning (IL) policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc. into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the IL policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Jia Gong, Jun Liu, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) enhances the performance of a student network by allowing it to learn the knowledge transferred from a teacher network incrementally. Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of generative models (GANs, VAEs, DMs, and LLMs) used to synthesize various medical data types, including imaging (dermoscopic, mammographic, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray), text, time-series, and tabular data (EHR). Unlike previous narrowly focused reviews, our study encompasses a broad array of medical data modalities and explores various generative models. Our search strategy queries databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ArXiv, focusing on recent works from January 2021 to November 2023, excluding reviews and perspectives. This period emphasizes recent advancements beyond GANs, which have been extensively covered previously.
  The survey reveals insights from three key aspects: (1) Synthesis applications and purpose of synthesis, (2) generation techniques, and (3) evaluation methods. It highlights clinically valid synthesis applications, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data to tackle diverse clinical requirements. While conditional models incorporating class labels, segmentation masks and image translations are prevalent, there is a gap in utilizing prior clinical knowledge and patient-specific context, suggesting a need for more personalized synthesis approaches and emphasizing the importance of tailoring generative approaches to the unique characteristics of medical data. Additionally, there is a significant gap in using synthetic data beyond augmentation, such as for validation and evaluation of downstream medical AI models. The survey uncovers that the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies tailored to medical images is a barrier to clinical application, underscoring the need for in-depth evaluation approaches, benchmarking, and comparative studies to promote openness and collaboration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a widely used method to study molecules and processes in medicine, life sciences, chemistry, catalysis, and industrial product quality control, among many other applications. One of the main features of some mass spectrometry techniques is the extensive level of characterization (especially when coupled with chromatography and ion mobility methods, or a part of tandem mass spectrometry experiment) and a large amount of generated data per measurement. Terabyte scales can be easily reached with mass spectrometry studies. Consequently, mass spectrometry has faced the challenge of a high level of data disappearance. Researchers often neglect and then altogether lose access to the rich information mass spectrometry experiments could provide. With the development of machine learning methods, the opportunity arises to unlock the potential of these data, enabling previously inaccessible discoveries. The present perspective highlights reevaluation of mass spectrometry data analysis in the new generation of methods and describes significant challenges in the field, particularly related to problems involving the use of electrospray ionization. We argue that further applications of machine learning raise new requirements for instrumentation (increasing throughput and information density, decreasing pricing, and making more automation-friendly software), and once met, the field may experience significant transformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Jiayi Du, Tao Meng, Haiyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to analyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal information in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation understanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to model conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic relationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) for multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first use pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture contextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then, we use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion interaction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm to precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an emotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic associations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion and adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information between speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain high-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction. Extensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times reduced by 52\% and 35\%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Malaria parasites pose a significant global health burden, causing widespread suffering and mortality. Detecting malaria infection accurately is crucial for effective treatment and control. However, existing automated detection techniques have shown limitations in terms of accuracy and generalizability. Many studies have focused on specific features without exploring more comprehensive approaches. In our case, we formulate a deep learning technique for malaria-infected cell classification using traditional CNNs and transfer learning models notably VGG19, InceptionV3, and Xception. The models were trained using NIH datasets and tested using different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The test results showed that deep CNNs achieved the highest accuracy -- 97%, followed by Xception with an accuracy of 95%. A machine learning model SVM achieved an accuracy of 83%, while an Inception-V3 achieved an accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, the system can be accessed through a web interface, where users can upload blood smear images for malaria detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown tremendous promise in serving as the backbone to agentic systems, as demonstrated by their performance in multi-faceted, challenging benchmarks like SWE-Bench and Agent-Bench. However, to realize the true potential of LLMs as autonomous agents, they must learn to identify, call, and interact with external tools and application program interfaces (APIs) to complete complex tasks. These tasks together are termed function calling. Endowing LLMs with function calling abilities leads to a myriad of advantages, such as access to current and domain-specific information in databases and knowledge sources, and the ability to outsource tasks that can be reliably performed by tools, e.g., a Python interpreter or calculator. While there has been significant progress in function calling with LLMs, there is still a dearth of open models that perform on par with proprietary LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING model under an Apache 2.0 license. The model is trained using a multi-task training approach on seven fundamental tasks encompassed in function calling, those being Nested Function Calling, Function Chaining, Parallel Functions, Function Name Detection, Parameter-Value Pair Detection, Next-Best Function, and Response Generation. We present a comprehensive evaluation on multiple out-of-domain datasets comparing GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING to more than 15 other best proprietary and open models. GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING provides the best performance among all open models on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard and fourth overall. As a result of the diverse tasks and datasets used for training our model, we show that GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING has better generalizability on multiple tasks in seven different evaluation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangba Yu, Gou Tan, Haojia Huang, Zhenyu Zhang, Pengfei Chen, Roberto Natella, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to its integration into various areas, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhancing capabilities in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). However, the complexity of AI systems has also exposed their vulnerabilities, necessitating robust methods for failure analysis (FA) and fault injection (FI) to ensure resilience and reliability. Despite the importance of these techniques, there lacks a comprehensive review of FA and FI methodologies in AI systems. This study fills this gap by presenting a detailed survey of existing FA and FI approaches across six layers of AI systems. We systematically analyze 160 papers and repositories to answer three research questions including (1) what are the prevalent failures in AI systems, (2) what types of faults can current FI tools simulate, (3) what gaps exist between the simulated faults and real-world failures. Our findings reveal a taxonomy of AI system failures, assess the capabilities of existing FI tools, and highlight discrepancies between real-world and simulated failures. Moreover, this survey contributes to the field by providing a framework for fault diagnosis, evaluating the state-of-the-art in FI, and identifying areas for improvement in FI techniques to enhance the resilience of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Xiong, Jiang Bian, Yuchen Li, Xuhong Li, Mengnan Du, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Sumi Helal</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with search engine services marks a significant shift in the field of services computing, opening up new possibilities to enhance how we search for and retrieve information, understand content, and interact with internet services. This paper conducts an in-depth examination of how integrating LLMs with search engines can mutually benefit both technologies. We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve LLMs (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs (LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide diverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the most relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately, how training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability to respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results can make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of LLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better indexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization, enhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help in annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts. However, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include addressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the computational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and continuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content. We discuss these challenges and chart out required research directions to address them. We also discuss broader implications for service computing, such as scalability, privacy concerns, and the need to adapt search engine architectures for these advanced models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Awasthi, Ngan Le, Zhigang Deng, Rishi Agrawal, Carol C. Wu, Hien Van Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting human gaze behavior within computer vision is integral for developing interactive systems that can anticipate user attention, address fundamental questions in cognitive science, and hold implications for fields like human-computer interaction (HCI) and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) systems. Despite methodologies introduced for modeling human eye gaze behavior, applying these models to medical imaging for scanpath prediction remains unexplored. Our proposed system aims to predict eye gaze sequences from radiology reports and CXR images, potentially streamlining data collection and enhancing AI systems using larger datasets. However, predicting human scanpaths on medical images presents unique challenges due to the diverse nature of abnormal regions. Our model predicts fixation coordinates and durations critical for medical scanpath prediction, outperforming existing models in the computer vision community. Utilizing a two-stage training process and large publicly available datasets, our approach generates static heatmaps and eye gaze videos aligned with radiology reports, facilitating comprehensive analysis. We validate our approach by comparing its performance with state-of-the-art methods and assessing its generalizability among different radiologists, introducing novel strategies to model radiologists' search patterns during CXR image diagnosis. Based on the radiologist's evaluation, MedGaze can generate human-like gaze sequences with a high focus on relevant regions over the CXR images. It sometimes also outperforms humans in terms of redundancy and randomness in the scanpaths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Shen, Yue Li, Desong Meng, Dongqi Cai, Sheng Qi, Li Zhang, Mengwei Xu, Yun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with application programming interfaces (APIs) have gained significant interest in both academia and industry. These API-based agents, leveraging the strong autonomy and planning capabilities of LLMs, can efficiently solve problems requiring multi-step actions. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands through APIs remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ShortcutsBench}, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving tasks with varying levels of difficulty, diverse task types, and real-world demands. \textsc{ShortcutsBench} includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc.'s operating systems, refined user queries from shortcuts, human-annotated high-quality action sequences from shortcut developers, and accurate parameter filling values about primitive parameter types, enum parameter types, outputs from previous actions, and parameters that need to request necessary information from the system or user. Our extensive evaluation of agents built with $5$ leading open-source (size >= 57B) and $4$ closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-3.5) reveals significant limitations in handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary information from systems and users. These findings highlight the challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries.

<p>Abstract: Big data contain rich information for machine learning algorithms to utilize when learning important features during classification tasks. Human beings express their emotion using certain words, speech (tone, pitch, speed) or facial expression. Artificial Intelligence approach to emotion classification are largely based on learning from textual information. However, public datasets containing text and speech data provide sufficient resources to train machine learning algorithms for the tack of emotion classification. In this paper, we present novel bimodal deep learning-based architectures enhanced with attention mechanism trained and tested on text and speech data for emotion classification. We report details of different deep learning based architectures and show the performance of each architecture including rigorous error analyses. Our finding suggests that deep learning based architectures trained on different types of data (text and speech) outperform architectures trained only on text or speech. Our proposed attention-based bimodal architecture outperforms several state-of-the-art systems in emotion classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient data transmission scheduling within vehicular environments poses a significant challenge due to the high mobility of such networks. Contemporary research predominantly centers on crafting cooperative scheduling algorithms tailored for vehicular networks. Notwithstanding, the intricacies of orchestrating scheduling in vehicular social networks both effectively and efficiently remain formidable. This paper introduces an innovative learning-based algorithm for scheduling data transmission that prioritizes efficiency and security within vehicular social networks. The algorithm first uses a specifically constructed neural network to enhance data processing capabilities. After this, it incorporates a Q-learning paradigm during the data transmission phase to optimize the information exchange, the privacy of which is safeguarded by differential privacy through the communication process. Comparative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Q-learning enhanced scheduling algorithm relative to existing state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms in the context of vehicular social networks.</p>

Traditional methods struggle to capture its intricate relationships. We investigate graph neural networks (GNNs) for this task, aiming to derive meaningful representations of individual gut microbiomes. Unlike methods relying solely on taxa abundance, we directly leverage phylogenetic relationships, in order to obtain a generalized encoder for taxa networks. The representation learnt from the encoder are then used to train a model for phenotype prediction such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahad Al-Khalifa, Hend Al-Khalifa</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing importance of Arabic as a global language, there is a notable lack of language models pre-trained exclusively on Arabic data. This shortage has led to limited benchmarks available for assessing language model performance in Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce two novel benchmarks designed to evaluate models' mathematical reasoning and language understanding abilities in Arabic. These benchmarks are derived from a General Aptitude Test (GAT) called Qiyas exam, a standardized test widely used for university admissions in Saudi Arabia. For validation purposes, we assess the performance of ChatGPT-3.5-trubo and ChatGPT-4 on our benchmarks. Our findings reveal that these benchmarks pose a significant challenge, with ChatGPT-4 achieving an overall average accuracy of 64%, while ChatGPT-3.5-trubo achieved an overall accuracy of 49% across the various question types in the Qiyas benchmark. We believe the release of these benchmarks will pave the way for enhancing the mathematical reasoning and language understanding capabilities of future models tailored for the low-resource Arabic language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dat Hong, Philip M. Polgreen, Alberto Maria Segre</p>
<p>Abstract: Hospitalizations that follow closely on the heels of one or more emergency department visits are often symptoms of missed opportunities to form a proper diagnosis. These diagnostic errors imply a failure to recognize the need for hospitalization and deliver appropriate care, and thus also bear important connotations for patient safety. In this paper, we show how data mining techniques can be applied to a large existing hospitalization data set to learn useful models that predict these upcoming hospitalizations with high accuracy. Specifically, we use an ensemble of logistics regression, na\"ive Bayes and association rule classifiers to successfully predict hospitalization within 3, 7 and 14 days of an emergency department discharge. Aside from high accuracy, one of the advantages of the techniques proposed here is that the resulting classifier is easily inspected and interpreted by humans so that the learned rules can be readily operationalized. These rules can then be easily distributed and applied directly by physicians in emergency department settings to predict the risk of early admission prior to discharging their emergency department patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the United States has witnessed a significant surge in the popularity of vaping or e-cigarette use, leading to a notable rise in cases of e-cigarette and vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that caused hospitalizations and fatalities during the EVALI outbreak in 2019, highlighting the urgency to comprehend vaping behaviors and develop effective strategies for cessation. Due to the ubiquity of social media platforms, over 4.7 billion users worldwide use them for connectivity, communications, news, and entertainment with a significant portion of the discourse related to health, thereby establishing social media data as an invaluable organic data resource for public health research. In this study, we extracted a sample dataset from one vaping sub-community on Reddit to analyze users' quit-vaping intentions. Leveraging OpenAI's latest large language model GPT-4 for sentence-level quit vaping intention detection, this study compares the outcomes of this model against layman and clinical expert annotations. Using different prompting strategies such as zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, we developed 8 prompts with varying levels of detail to explain the task to GPT-4 and also evaluated the performance of the strategies against each other. These preliminary findings emphasize the potential of GPT-4 in social media data analysis, especially in identifying users' subtle intentions that may elude human detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Voice signal classification based on human behaviours involves analyzing various aspects of speech patterns and delivery styles. In this study, a real-time dataset collection is performed where participants are instructed to speak twelve psychology questions in two distinct manners: first, in a harsh voice, which is categorized as "misbehaved"; and second, in a polite manner, categorized as "normal". These classifications are crucial in understanding how different vocal behaviours affect the interpretation and classification of voice signals. This research highlights the significance of voice tone and delivery in automated machine-learning systems for voice analysis and recognition. This research contributes to the broader field of voice signal analysis by elucidating the impact of human behaviour on the perception and categorization of voice signals, thereby enhancing the development of more accurate and context-aware voice recognition technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Fayyaz, Fan Yin, Jiao Sun, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how well large language models (LLMs) explain their generations with rationales -- a set of tokens extracted from the input texts that reflect the decision process of LLMs. We examine LLM rationales extracted with two methods: 1) attribution-based methods that use attention or gradients to locate important tokens, and 2) prompting-based methods that guide LLMs to extract rationales using prompts. Through extensive experiments, we show that prompting-based rationales align better with human-annotated rationales than attribution-based rationales, and demonstrate reasonable alignment with humans even when model performance is poor. We additionally find that the faithfulness limitations of prompting-based methods, which are identified in previous work, may be linked to their collapsed predictions. By fine-tuning these models on the corresponding datasets, both prompting and attribution methods demonstrate improved faithfulness. Our study sheds light on more rigorous and fair evaluations of LLM rationales, especially for prompting-based ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing and manipulating virtual human heads is essential across various applications, including AR, VR, gaming, human-computer interaction and VFX. Traditional graphic-based approaches require manual effort and resources to achieve accurate representation of human heads. While modern deep learning techniques can generate and edit highly photorealistic images of faces, their focus remains predominantly on 2D facial images. This limitation makes them less suitable for 3D applications. Recognizing the vital role of editing within the UV texture space as a key component in the 3D graphics pipeline, our work focuses on this aspect to benefit graphic designers by providing enhanced control and precision in appearance manipulation. Research on existing methods within the UV texture space is limited, complex, and poses challenges. In this paper, we introduce SemUV: a simple and effective approach using the FFHQ-UV dataset for semantic manipulation directly within the UV texture space. We train a StyleGAN model on the publicly available FFHQ-UV dataset, and subsequently train a boundary for interpolation and semantic feature manipulation. Through experiments comparing our method with 2D manipulation technique, we demonstrate its superior ability to preserve identity while effectively modifying semantic features such as age, gender, and facial hair. Our approach is simple, agnostic to other 3D components such as structure, lighting, and rendering, and also enables seamless integration into standard 3D graphics pipelines without demanding extensive domain expertise, time, or resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in vision-language models, their performance remains suboptimal on images from non-western cultures due to underrepresentation in training datasets. Various benchmarks have been proposed to test models' cultural inclusivity, but they have limited coverage of cultures and do not adequately assess cultural diversity across universal as well as culture-specific local concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce the GlobalRG benchmark, comprising two challenging tasks: retrieval across universals and cultural visual grounding. The former task entails retrieving culturally diverse images for universal concepts from 50 countries, while the latter aims at grounding culture-specific concepts within images from 15 countries. Our evaluation across a wide range of models reveals that the performance varies significantly across cultures -- underscoring the necessity for enhancing multicultural understanding in vision-language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is challenging due to precise spatial and temporal coordination required between two arms. While there exist several real-world bimanual systems, there is a lack of simulated benchmarks with a large task diversity for systematically studying bimanual capabilities across a wide range of tabletop tasks. This paper addresses the gap by extending RLBench to bimanual manipulation.

To kickstart the benchmark, we extended several state-of-the art methods to bimanual manipulation and also present a language-conditioned behavioral cloning agent -- PerAct2, which enables the learning and execution of bimanual 6-DoF manipulation tasks. Our novel network architecture efficiently integrates language processing with action prediction, allowing robots to understand and perform complex bimanual tasks in response to user-specified goals.

<p>Abstract: Recent research suggests that tree search algorithms (e.g. Monte Carlo Tree Search) can dramatically boost LLM performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. However, they often require more than 10 times the computational resources of greedy decoding due to wasteful search strategies, making them difficult to be deployed in practical applications. This study introduces a novel guided tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and node-level exploration budget (maximum number of children) calculation to tackle this issue. By considering the search progress towards the final answer (history) and the guidance from a value network (future) trained without any step-wise annotations, our algorithm iteratively selects the most promising tree node before expanding it within the boundaries of the allocated computational budget. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets demonstrate that our approach not only offers competitive performance but also enjoys significantly lower computational costs compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Investigations into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Korean restaurant reviews are notably lacking in the existing literature. Our research proposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource languages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating translated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on translated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we applied LaBSE and MSP-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit feature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through additional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset gaps, achieving positive results in Korean ABSA with minimal resources. Through additional data injection pipelines, our approach aims to utilize high-resource data and construct effective models within communities, whether corporate or individual, in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our framework showed an approximately 3% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We release the dataset and our code for Korean ABSA, at this link.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phytoplankton, a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, requires efficient monitoring to understand marine ecological processes and environmental conditions. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods, relying on non-in situ observations, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting timely analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce PhyTracker, an intelligent in situ tracking framework designed for automatic tracking of phytoplankton. PhyTracker overcomes significant challenges unique to phytoplankton monitoring, such as constrained mobility within water flow, inconspicuous appearance, and the presence of impurities. Our method incorporates three innovative modules: a Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction (TFE) module, an Attention-enhanced Temporal Association (ATA) module, and a Flow-agnostic Movement Refinement (FMR) module. These modules enhance feature capture, differentiate between phytoplankton and impurities, and refine movement characteristics, respectively. Extensive experiments on the PMOT dataset validate the superiority of PhyTracker in phytoplankton tracking, and additional tests on the MOT dataset demonstrate its general applicability, outperforming conventional tracking methods. This work highlights key differences between phytoplankton and traditional objects, offering an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.</p>

It retrieves documents by directly decoding their contents, constrained on the corpus. Unifying retrieval with generation allows us to adapt to diverse new tasks via prompting alone. RICHES can work with any Instruction-tuned model, without additional training. It provides attributed evidence, supports multi-hop retrievals and interleaves thoughts to plan on what to retrieve next, all within a single decoding pass of the LLM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiliang Zhang, Yujia Tong, Chenghu Du, Chao Che, Yongjun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based RGB caries detection improves the efficiency of caries identification and is crucial for preventing oral diseases. The performance of deep learning models depends on high-quality data and requires substantial training resources, making efficient deployment challenging. Core data selection, by eliminating low-quality and confusing data, aims to enhance training efficiency without significantly compromising model performance. However, distance-based data selection methods struggle to distinguish dependencies among high-dimensional caries data. To address this issue, we propose a Core Data Selection Method with Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSCDS) for efficient caries image learning and caries classification. We describe the core data selection criterion as the distribution of samples in different classes. JSCDS calculates the cluster centers by sample embedding representation in the caries classification network and utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to compute the mutual information between data samples and cluster centers, capturing nonlinear dependencies among high-dimensional data. The average mutual information is calculated to fit the above distribution, serving as the criterion for constructing the core set for model training. Extensive experiments on RGB caries datasets show that JSCDS outperforms other data selection methods in prediction performance and time consumption. Notably, JSCDS exceeds the performance of the full dataset model with only 50% of the core data, with its performance advantage becoming more pronounced in the 70% of core data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjiang Zhou, Xiaochuan Shi, Chao Ma, Zepeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradients play a pivotal role in neural networks explanation. The inherent high dimensionality and structural complexity of neural networks result in the original gradients containing a significant amount of noise. While several approaches were proposed to reduce noise with smoothing, there is little discussion of the rationale behind smoothing gradients in neural networks. In this work, we proposed a gradient smooth theoretical framework for neural networks based on the function mollification and Monte Carlo integration. The framework intrinsically axiomatized gradient smoothing and reveals the rationale of existing methods. Furthermore, we provided an approach to design new smooth methods derived from the framework. By experimental measurement of several newly designed smooth methods, we demonstrated the research potential of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Di Wu, Haoran Wang, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures? In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingrui Zhang, Chunyang Wang, Stephan Kramer, Joseph G. Wallwork, Siyi Li, Jiancheng Liu, Xiang Chen, Matthew D. Piggott</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Cao, Shijie Xue, Jindong Li, Qi Wang, Yi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has attracted increasing interest due to its widespread application. In recent studies, knowledge distillation-based methods have been widely used in unsupervised anomaly detection to improve model efficiency and generalization. However, the inherent symmetry between the source (teacher) and target (student) networks typically results in consistent outputs across both architectures, making it difficult to distinguish abnormal graphs from normal graphs. Also, existing methods mainly rely on graph features to distinguish anomalies, which may be unstable with complex and diverse data and fail to capture the essence that differentiates normal graphs from abnormal ones. In this work, we propose a Graph Normalizing Flows-driven Asymmetric Network For Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (FANFOLD in short). We introduce normalizing flows to unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection due to their successful application and superior quality in learning the underlying distribution of samples. Specifically, we adopt the knowledge distillation technique and apply normalizing flows on the source network, achieving the asymmetric network. In the training stage, FANFOLD transforms the original distribution of normal graphs to a standard normal distribution. During inference, FANFOLD computes the anomaly score using the source-target loss to discriminate between normal and anomalous graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on 15 datasets of different fields with 9 baseline methods to validate the superiority of FANFOLD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canyun Dai, Xiaoyan Sun, Hejuan Hu, Wei Song, Yong Zhang, Dunwei Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: The dispatch optimization of coal mine integrated energy system is challenging due to high dimensionality, strong coupling constraints, and multiobjective. Existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms struggle with locating multiple small and irregular feasible regions, making them inaplicable to this problem. To address this issue, we here develop a multitask evolutionary algorithm framework that incorporates the dispatch correlated domain knowledge to effectively deal with strong constraints and multiobjective optimization. Possible evolutionary multitask construction strategy based on complex constraint relationship analysis and handling, i.e., constraint coupled spatial decomposition, constraint strength classification and constraint handling technique, is first explored. Within the multitask evolutionary optimization framework, two strategies, i.e., an elite guided knowledge transfer by designing a special crowding distance mechanism to select dominant individuals from each task, and an adaptive neighborhood technology based mutation to effectively balance the diversity and convergence of each optimized task for the differential evolution algorithm, are further developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm in feasibility, convergence, and diversity is demonstrated in a case study of a coal mine integrated energy system by comparing with CPLEX solver and seven constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kausik Bhattacharya, Anubhab Majumder, Amaresh Chakrabarti</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation of systems using the SAPPhIRE model of causality can be an inspirational stimulus in design. However, creating a SAPPhIRE model of a technical or a natural system requires sourcing technical knowledge from multiple technical documents regarding how the system works. This research investigates how to generate technical content accurately relevant to the SAPPhIRE model of causality using a Large Language Model, also called LLM. This paper, which is the first part of the two-part research, presents a method for hallucination suppression using Retrieval Augmented Generating with LLM to generate technical content supported by the scientific information relevant to a SAPPhIRE con-struct. The result from this research shows that the selection of reference knowledge used in providing context to the LLM for generating the technical content is very important. The outcome of this research is used to build a software support tool to generate the SAPPhIRE model of a given technical system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic reasoning is a fundamental cognitive ability that plays a pivotal role in problem-solving and decision-making processes. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as motor control, handling perceptual input, and managing stochastic environments. These advancements have been enabled in part by the availability of benchmarks. In this work we introduce PUZZLES, a benchmark based on Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, aimed at fostering progress in algorithmic and logical reasoning in RL. PUZZLES contains 40 diverse logic puzzles of adjustable sizes and varying levels of complexity; many puzzles also feature a diverse set of additional configuration parameters. The 40 puzzles provide detailed information on the strengths and generalization capabilities of RL agents. Furthermore, we evaluate various RL algorithms on PUZZLES, providing baseline comparisons and demonstrating the potential for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Goldman, Alon Jacovi, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Ido Dagan, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Improvements in language models' capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of "long-context", defined simply by the total length of the model's input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan L. Vo, Thu Nguyen, Hugo L. Hammer, Michael A. Riegler, Pal Halvorsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue that can significantly impair model performance and interpretability. This paper briefly summarizes the development of the field of missing data with respect to Explainable Artificial Intelligence and experimentally investigates the effects of various imputation methods on the calculation of Shapley values, a popular technique for interpreting complex machine learning models. We compare different imputation strategies and assess their impact on feature importance and interaction as determined by Shapley values. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze the effects of missing values on Shapley values. Importantly, our findings reveal that the choice of imputation method can introduce biases that could lead to changes in the Shapley values, thereby affecting the interpretability of the model. Moreover, and that a lower test prediction mean square error (MSE) may not imply a lower MSE in Shapley values and vice versa. Also, while Xgboost is a method that could handle missing data directly, using Xgboost directly on missing data can seriously affect interpretability compared to imputing the data before training Xgboost. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of imputation methods in the context of model interpretation, offering practical guidance for selecting appropriate techniques based on dataset characteristics and analysis objectives. The results underscore the importance of considering imputation effects to ensure robust and reliable insights from machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Loftin, Saptarashmi Bandyopadhyay, Mustafa Mert \c{C}elikok</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificially intelligent agents deployed in the real-world will require the ability to reliably \textit{cooperate} with humans (as well as other, heterogeneous AI agents). To provide formal guarantees of successful cooperation, we must make some assumptions about how partner agents could plausibly behave. Any realistic set of assumptions must account for the fact that other agents may be just as adaptable as our agent is. In this work, we consider the problem of cooperating with a \textit{population} of agents in a finitely-repeated, two player general-sum matrix game with private utilities. Two natural assumptions in such settings are that: 1) all agents in the population are individually rational learners, and 2) when any two members of the population are paired together, with high-probability they will achieve at least the same utility as they would under some Pareto efficient equilibrium strategy. Our results first show that these assumptions alone are insufficient to ensure \textit{zero-shot} cooperation with members of the target population. We therefore consider the problem of \textit{learning} a strategy for cooperating with such a population using prior observations its members interacting with one another. We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of samples needed to learn an effective cooperation strategy. Most importantly, we show that these bounds can be much stronger than those arising from a "naive'' reduction of the problem to one of imitation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoichi Ishizuka, Takashi Imai, Kaoru Kawamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method of model-based time series clustering with mixtures of general state space models (MSSMs). Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought a paradigm shift to the field of code generation, offering the potential to enhance the software development process.

In this paper, we empirically analyze the differences in coding style between the code generated by mainstream Code LLMs and the code written by human developers, and summarize coding style inconsistency taxonomy. Specifically, we first summarize the types of coding style inconsistencies by manually analyzing a large number of generation results. We then compare the code generated by Code LLMs with the code written by human programmers in terms of readability, conciseness, and robustness. The results reveal that LLMs and developers have different coding styles. Additionally, we study the possible causes of these inconsistencies and provide some solutions to alleviate the problem.</p>

We propose a new framework, Personalized Federated Learning via Feature Enhancement (pFLFE), designed to mitigate these challenges. pFLFE consists of two main stages: feature enhancement and supervised learning. The first stage improves differentiation between foreground and background features, and the second uses these enhanced features for learning from segmentation masks. We also design an alternative training approach that requires fewer communication rounds without compromising segmentation quality, even with limited communication resources. Through experiments on three medical segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that pFLFE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pursuing artificial intelligence for biomedical science, a.k.a. AI Scientist, draws increasing attention, where one common approach is to build a copilot agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, to evaluate such systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering (QA) to the LLM itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce BioKGBench. In contrast to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle "Understanding Literature" into two atomic abilities, i) "Understanding" the unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph Question-Answering (KGQA) as a form of "Literature" grounding. We then formulate a novel agent task, dubbed KGCheck, using KGQA and domain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify the factual errors of existing large-scale knowledge graph databases. We collect over two thousand data for two atomic tasks and 225 high-quality annotated data for the agent task. Surprisingly, we discover that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on our benchmark. We then introduce a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed BKGAgent. On the widely used popular knowledge graph, we discover over 90 factual errors which provide scenarios for agents to make discoveries and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive cross-modal understanding and reasoning abilities, often assessed through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that include an image, a question, and several options. However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the evolving application of medical artificial intelligence, federated learning is notable for its ability to protect training data privacy. Federated learning facilitates collaborative model development without the need to share local data from healthcare institutions. Yet, the statistical and system heterogeneity among these institutions poses substantial challenges, which affects the effectiveness of federated learning and hampers the exchange of information between clients. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, MH-pFLGB, which employs a global bypass strategy to mitigate the reliance on public datasets and navigate the complexities of non-IID data distributions. Our method enhances traditional federated learning by integrating a global bypass model, which would share the information among the clients, but also serves as part of the network to enhance the performance on each client. Additionally, MH-pFLGB provides a feature fusion module to better combine the local and global features. We validate \model{}'s effectiveness and adaptability through extensive testing on different medical tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanming Yao, Yongqi Zhang, Yaqing Wang, Nan Yin, James Kwok, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling law, a strategy that involves the brute-force scaling of the training dataset and learnable parameters, has become a prevalent approach for developing stronger learning models. In this paper, we examine its rationale in terms of learning from relational graphs. We demonstrate that directly adhering to such a scaling law does not necessarily yield stronger models due to architectural incompatibility and representation bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for learning from relational graphs via knowledge-aware parsimony learning. Our method draws inspiration from the duality between data and knowledge inherent in these graphs. Specifically, we first extract knowledge (like symbolic logic and physical laws) during the learning process, and then apply combinatorial generalization to the task at hand. This extracted knowledge serves as the ``building blocks'' for achieving parsimony learning. By applying this philosophy to architecture, parameters, and inference, we can effectively achieve versatile, sample-efficient, and interpretable learning. Experimental results show that our proposed framework surpasses methods that strictly follow the traditional scaling-up roadmap. This highlights the importance of incorporating knowledge in the development of next-generation learning technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barproda Halder, Faisal Hamman, Pasan Dissanayake, Qiuyi Zhang, Ilia Sucholutsky, Sanghamitra Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurious patterns refer to a mathematical association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. However, this notion of spuriousness, which is usually introduced due to sampling biases in the dataset, has classically lacked a formal definition. To address this gap, this work presents the first information-theoretic formalization of spuriousness in a dataset (given a split of spurious and core features) using a mathematical framework called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Specifically, we disentangle the joint information content that the spurious and core features share about another target variable (e.g., the prediction label) into distinct components, namely unique, redundant, and synergistic information. We propose the use of unique information, with roots in Blackwell Sufficiency, as a novel metric to formally quantify dataset spuriousness and derive its desirable properties. We empirically demonstrate how higher unique information in the spurious features in a dataset could lead a model into choosing the spurious features over the core features for inference, often having low worst-group-accuracy. We also propose a novel autoencoder-based estimator for computing unique information that is able to handle high-dimensional image data. Finally, we also show how this unique information in the spurious feature is reduced across several dataset-based spurious-pattern-mitigation techniques such as data reweighting and varying levels of background mixing, demonstrating a novel tradeoff between unique information (spuriousness) and worst-group-accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunquan Deng, Zeyu Huang, Chen Li, Chenghua Lin, Min Gao, Wenge Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in fluency but risk producing inaccurate content, called "hallucinations." This paper outlines a standardized process for categorizing fine-grained hallucination types and proposes an innovative framework--the Progressive Fine-grained Model Editor (PFME)--specifically designed to detect and correct fine-grained hallucinations in LLMs. PFME consists of two collaborative modules: the Real-time Fact Retrieval Module and the Fine-grained Hallucination Detection and Editing Module. The former identifies key entities in the document and retrieves the latest factual evidence from credible sources. The latter further segments the document into sentence-level text and, based on relevant evidence and previously edited context, identifies, locates, and edits each sentence's hallucination type. Experimental results on FavaBench and FActScore demonstrate that PFME outperforms existing methods in fine-grained hallucination detection tasks. Particularly, when using the Llama3-8B-Instruct model, PFME's performance in fine-grained hallucination detection with external knowledge assistance improves by 8.7 percentage points (pp) compared to ChatGPT. In editing tasks, PFME further enhances the FActScore of FActScore-Alpaca13B and FActScore-ChatGPT datasets, increasing by 16.2pp and 4.6pp, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aicheng Gong, Kai Yang, Jiafei Lyu, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Task allocation is a key combinatorial optimization problem, crucial for modern applications such as multi-robot cooperation and resource scheduling. Decision makers must allocate entities to tasks reasonably across different scenarios. However, traditional methods assume static attributes and numbers of tasks and entities, often relying on dynamic programming and heuristic algorithms for solutions. In reality, task allocation resembles Markov decision processes, with dynamically changing task and entity attributes. Thus, algorithms must dynamically allocate tasks based on their states. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage task allocation algorithm based on similarity, utilizing reinforcement learning to learn allocation strategies. The proposed pre-assign strategy allows entities to preselect appropriate tasks, effectively avoiding local optima and thereby better finding the optimal allocation. We also introduce an attention mechanism and a hyperparameter network structure to adapt to the changing number and attributes of entities and tasks, enabling our network structure to generalize to new tasks. Experimental results across multiple environments demonstrate that our algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic task allocation in practical applications. Compared to heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms, our reinforcement learning approach better solves dynamic allocation problems and achieves zero-shot generalization to new tasks with good performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wang, Jinhao Duan, Lu Cheng, Yue Zhang, Qingni Wang, Hengtao Shen, Xiaofeng Zhu, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in natural language generation (NLG) tasks remains an open challenge, exacerbated by the intricate nature of the recent large language models (LLMs). This study investigates adapting conformal prediction (CP), which can convert any heuristic measure of uncertainty into rigorous theoretical guarantees by constructing prediction sets, for black-box LLMs in open-ended NLG tasks. We propose a sampling-based uncertainty measure leveraging self-consistency and develop a conformal uncertainty criterion by integrating the uncertainty condition aligned with correctness into the design of the CP algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our uncertainty measure generally surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we calibrate the prediction sets within the model's unfixed answer distribution and achieve strict control over the correctness coverage rate across 6 LLMs on 4 free-form NLG datasets, spanning general-purpose and medical domains, while the small average set size further highlights the efficiency of our method in providing trustworthy guarantees for practical open-ended NLG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Moazeni, Shichong Peng, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in neural rendering have excelled at novel view synthesis from multi-view RGB images. However, they often lack the capability to edit the shading or colour of the scene at a detailed point-level, while ensuring consistency across different viewpoints. In this work, we address the challenge of point-level 3D scene albedo and shading editing from multi-view RGB images, focusing on detailed editing at the point-level rather than at a part or global level. While prior works based on volumetric representation such as NeRF struggle with achieving 3D consistent editing at the point level, recent advancements in point-based neural rendering show promise in overcoming this challenge. We introduce ``Intrinsic PAPR'', a novel method based on the recent point-based neural rendering technique Proximity Attention Point Rendering (PAPR). Unlike other point-based methods that model the intrinsic decomposition of the scene, our approach does not rely on complicated shading models or simplistic priors that may not universally apply. Instead, we directly model scene decomposition into albedo and shading components, leading to better estimation accuracy. Comparative evaluations against the latest point-based inverse rendering methods demonstrate that Intrinsic PAPR achieves higher-quality novel view rendering and superior point-level albedo and shading editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of aeroengine performance is of paramount importance for engine design, maintenance, and optimization endeavours. However, existing methodologies often struggle to strike an optimal balance among predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, modelling complexity, and data dependency. To address these challenges, we propose a strategy that synergistically combines domain knowledge from both the aeroengine and neural network realms to enable real-time prediction of engine performance parameters. Leveraging aeroengine domain knowledge, we judiciously design the network structure and regulate the internal information flow. Concurrently, drawing upon neural network domain expertise, we devise four distinct feature fusion methods and introduce an innovative loss function formulation. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive validation across two distinct datasets. The empirical results demonstrate :(1) the evident advantages of our tailored loss function; (2) our model's ability to maintain equal or superior performance with a reduced parameter count; (3) our model's reduced data dependency compared to generalized neural network architectures; (4)Our model is more interpretable than traditional black box machine learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Fan, Kun Yi, Hangting Ye, Zhiyuan Ning, Qi Zhang, Ning An</p>
<p>Abstract: While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Schmiedel</p>
<p>Abstract: Poor bucking decisions made by forest harvesters can have a negative effect on the products that are generated from the logs. Making the right bucking decisions is not an easy task because harvesters must rely on predictions of the stem profile for the part of the stems that is not yet measured. The goal of this project is to improve the bucking decisions made by forest harvesters with a stochastic bucking method. We developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that predicted the parameters of a Gaussian distribution conditioned on the known part of the stem, enabling the creation of multiple samples of stem profile predictions for the unknown part of the stem. The bucking decisions could then be optimized using a novel stochastic bucking algorithm which used all the stem profiles generated to choose the logs to generate from the stem. The stochastic bucking algorithm was compared to two benchmark models: A polynomial model that could not condition its predictions on more than one diameter measurement, and a deterministic LSTM neural network. All models were evaluated on stem profiles of four coniferous species prevalent in eastern Canada. In general, the best bucking decisions were taken by the stochastic LSTM models, demonstrating the usefulness of the method. The second-best results were mostly obtained by the deterministic LSTM model and the worst results by the polynomial model, corroborating the usefulness of conditioning the stem curve predictions on multiple measurements.</p>

We use these maps to analyse how models make predictions in different conditions and to show that the spread of attention is reduced as a model is finetuned, and the model attention is concentrated on specific phoneme regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiarash Sedghighadikolaei, Attila A Yavuz</p>
<p>Abstract: The shift towards efficient and automated data analysis through Machine Learning (ML) has notably impacted healthcare systems, particularly Radiomics. Radiomics leverages ML to analyze medical images accurately and efficiently for precision medicine. Current methods rely on Deep Learning (DL) to improve performance and accuracy (Deep Radiomics). Given the sensitivity of medical images, ensuring privacy throughout the Deep Radiomics pipeline-from data generation and collection to model training and inference-is essential, especially when outsourced. Thus, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are crucial tools for Deep Radiomics. Previous studies and systematization efforts have either broadly overviewed PETs and their applications or mainly focused on subsets of PETs for ML algorithms. In Deep Radiomics, where efficiency, accuracy, and privacy are crucial, many PETs, while theoretically applicable, may not be practical without specialized optimizations or hybrid designs. Additionally, not all DL models are suitable for Radiomics. Consequently, there is a need for specialized studies that investigate and systematize the effective and practical integration of PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline. This work addresses this research gap by (1) classifying existing PETs, presenting practical hybrid PETS constructions, and a taxonomy illustrating their potential integration with the Deep Radiomics pipeline, with comparative analyses detailing assumptions, architectural suitability, and security, (2) Offering technical insights, describing potential challenges and means of combining PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline, including integration strategies, subtilities, and potential challenges, (3) Proposing potential research directions, identifying challenges, and suggesting solutions to enhance the PETs in Deep Radiomics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evidence to guide healthcare decisions is often limited by a lack of relevant and trustworthy literature as well as difficulty in contextualizing existing research for a specific patient. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially address both challenges by either summarizing published literature or generating new studies based on real-world data (RWD). We evaluated the ability of five LLM-based systems in answering 50 clinical questions and had nine independent physicians review the responses for relevance, reliability, and actionability. As it stands, general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5) rarely produced answers that were deemed relevant and evidence-based (2% - 10%). In contrast, retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based and agentic LLM systems produced relevant and evidence-based answers for 24% (OpenEvidence) to 58% (ChatRWD) of questions. Only the agentic ChatRWD was able to answer novel questions compared to other LLMs (65% vs. 0-9%). These results suggest that while general-purpose LLMs should not be used as-is, a purpose-built system for evidence summarization based on RAG and one for generating novel evidence working synergistically would improve availability of pertinent evidence for patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aamir Hasan, Neeloy Chakraborty, Haonan Chen, Jung-Hoon Cho, Cathy Wu, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Fleets of autonomous vehicles can mitigate traffic congestion through simple actions, thus improving many socioeconomic factors such as commute time and gas costs. However, these approaches are limited in practice as they assume precise control over autonomous vehicle fleets, incur extensive installation costs for a centralized sensor ecosystem, and also fail to account for uncertainty in driver behavior. To this end, we develop a class of learned residual policies that can be used in cooperative advisory systems and only require the use of a single vehicle with a human driver. Our policies advise drivers to behave in ways that mitigate traffic congestion while accounting for diverse driver behaviors, particularly drivers' reactions to instructions, to provide an improved user experience. To realize such policies, we introduce an improved reward function that explicitly addresses congestion mitigation and driver attitudes to advice. We show that our residual policies can be personalized by conditioning them on an inferred driver trait that is learned in an unsupervised manner with a variational autoencoder. Our policies are trained in simulation with our novel instruction adherence driver model, and evaluated in simulation and through a user study (N=16) to capture the sentiments of human drivers. Our results show that our approaches successfully mitigate congestion while adapting to different driver behaviors, with up to 20% and 40% improvement as measured by a combination metric of speed and deviations in speed across time over baselines in our simulation tests and user study, respectively. Our user study further shows that our policies are human-compatible and personalize to drivers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibyajyoti Chakraborty, Seung Whan Chung, Romit Maulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in various fields, such as the geosciences and engineering. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), which combine the power of neural networks and numerical solvers, have emerged as a promising algorithm for forecasting complex nonlinear dynamical systems. However, classical techniques used for NODE training are ineffective for learning chaotic dynamical systems. In this work, we propose a novel NODE-training approach that allows for robust learning of chaotic dynamical systems. Our method addresses the challenges of non-convexity and exploding gradients associated with underlying chaotic dynamics. Training data trajectories from such systems are split into multiple, non-overlapping time windows. In addition to the deviation from the training data, the optimization loss term further penalizes the discontinuities of the predicted trajectory between the time windows. The window size is selected based on the fastest Lyapunov time scale of the system. Multi-step penalty(MP) method is first demonstrated on Lorenz equation, to illustrate how it improves the loss landscape and thereby accelerating the optimization convergence. MP method can optimize chaotic systems in a manner similar to least-squares shadowing with significantly lower computational costs. Our proposed algorithm, denoted the Multistep Penalty NODE(MP-NODE), is applied to chaotic systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow. It is observed that MP-NODE provide viable performance for such chaotic systems, not only for short-term trajectory predictions but also for invariant statistics that are hallmarks of the chaotic nature of these dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihong Zhong, Xiaocheng Feng, Liang Zhao, Qiming Li, Lei Huang, Yuxuan Gu, Weitao Ma, Yuan Xu, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisong Xiao, Aishan Liu, QianJia Cheng, Zhenfei Yin, Siyuan Liang, Jiapeng Li, Jing Shao, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been widely adopted in various applications; however, they exhibit significant gender biases. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate gender bias at the demographic group level, neglecting individual fairness, which emphasizes equal treatment of similar individuals. This research gap limits the detection of discriminatory behaviors, as individual fairness offers a more granular examination of biases that group fairness may overlook. For the first time, this paper introduces the GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark to evaluate occupation-related gender bias in LVLMs using counterfactual visual questions under individual fairness criteria. To construct this benchmark, we first utilize text-to-image diffusion models to generate occupation images and their gender counterfactuals. Subsequently, we generate corresponding textual occupation options by identifying stereotyped occupation pairs with high semantic similarity but opposite gender proportions in real-world statistics. This method enables the creation of large-scale visual question counterfactuals to expose biases in LVLMs, applicable in both multimodal and unimodal contexts through modifying gender attributes in specific modalities. Overall, our GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark comprises 34,581 visual question counterfactual pairs, covering 177 occupations. Using our benchmark, we extensively evaluate 15 commonly used open-source LVLMs (\eg, LLaVA) and state-of-the-art commercial APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro. Our findings reveal widespread gender biases in existing LVLMs. Our benchmark offers: (1) a comprehensive dataset for occupation-related gender bias evaluation; (2) an up-to-date leaderboard on LVLM biases; and (3) a nuanced understanding of the biases presented by these models. \footnote{The dataset and code are available at the \href{https://genderbiasvl.github.io/}{website}.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Mingyue Huo, Nan Jiang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 41.5% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 38.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art iterative algorithm [Dong et al., 2024] under the BT model assumption. Additionally, our ablation study highlights the benefits of incorporating KL regularization for response length control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwoong Yoon, Himchan Hwang, Dohyun Kwon, Yung-Kyun Noh, Frank C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00641">HASNAS: A Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search Framework for Neuromorphic Compute-in-Memory Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low-power/energy computation. To further improve the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) paradigm with emerging device technologies such as resistive random access memory is employed. However, most of SNN architectures are developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Moreover, most of SNN designs are derived from the Artificial Neural Networks, whose network operations are different from SNNs. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose HASNAS, a novel hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS) framework for neuromorphic CIM systems that finds an SNN that offers high accuracy under the given memory, area, latency, and energy constraints. To achieve this, HASNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to achieve high accuracy, (2) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning process, and (3) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. The experimental results show that our HASNAS quickly finds an SNN that maintains high accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art by up to 11x speed-up, and meets the given constraints: 4x10^6 parameters of memory, 100mm^2 of area, 400ms of latency, and 120uJ energy consumption for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100; while the state-of-the-art fails to meet the constraints. In this manner, our HASNAS can enable efficient design automation for providing high-performance and energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which involve increasingly complex reasoning. Knowledge reasoning, a primary type of reasoning, aims at deriving new knowledge from existing one.While it has been widely studied in the context of knowledge graphs (KGs), knowledge reasoning in LLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Knowledge, a comprehensive framework for knowledge reasoning, including methodologies for both dataset construction and model learning. For dataset construction, we create KnowReason via rule mining on KGs. For model learning, we observe rule overfitting induced by naive training. Hence, we enhance CoK with a trial-and-error mechanism that simulates the human process of internal knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments with KnowReason. Our results show the effectiveness of CoK in refining LLMs in not only knowledge reasoning, but also general reasoning benchmarkms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pommerman is a multi-agent environment that has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. This environment is an ideal benchmark for multi-agent training, providing a battleground for two teams with communication capabilities among allied agents. Pommerman presents significant challenges for model-free reinforcement learning due to delayed action effects, sparse rewards, and false positives, where opponent players can lose due to their own mistakes. This study introduces a system designed to train multi-agent systems to play Pommerman using a combination of curriculum learning and population-based self-play. We also tackle two challenging problems when deploying the multi-agent training system for competitive games: sparse reward and suitable matchmaking mechanism. Specifically, we propose an adaptive annealing factor based on agents' performance to adjust the dense exploration reward during training dynamically. Additionally, we implement a matchmaking mechanism utilizing the Elo rating system to pair agents effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that our trained agent can outperform top learning agents without requiring communication among allied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekang Yang, Hong Liu, Xiangdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancer survival prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing of the tumor microenvironment within Whole Slide Image (WSI). Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawei Sun, Hao Feng, Julius Ott, Lorenzo Servadei, Robert Wille</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is critical in autonomous driving for interpreting 3D scenes accurately. Recently, radar-camera depth estimation has become of sufficient interest due to the robustness and low-cost properties of radar. Thus, this paper introduces a two-stage, end-to-end trainable Confidence-aware Fusion Net (CaFNet) for dense depth estimation, combining RGB imagery with sparse and noisy radar point cloud data. The first stage addresses radar-specific challenges, such as ambiguous elevation and noisy measurements, by predicting a radar confidence map and a preliminary coarse depth map. A novel approach is presented for generating the ground truth for the confidence map, which involves associating each radar point with its corresponding object to identify potential projection surfaces. These maps, together with the initial radar input, are processed by a second encoder. For the final depth estimation, we innovate a confidence-aware gated fusion mechanism to integrate radar and image features effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the depth map by filtering out radar noise. Our methodology, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates superior performance, improving upon the current leading model by 3.2% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 2.7% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sydney Balboni, Grace Ivey, Brett Storoe, John Cisler, Tyge Plater, Caitlyn Grant, Ella Bruce, Benjamin Paulson</p>
<p>Abstract: Price volatility in global food commodities is a critical signal indicating potential disruptions in the food market. Understanding forthcoming changes in these prices is essential for bolstering food security, particularly for nations at risk. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) previously developed sophisticated statistical frameworks for the proactive prediction of food commodity prices, aiding in the creation of global early warning systems. These frameworks utilize food security indicators to produce accurate forecasts, thereby facilitating preparations against potential food shortages. Our research builds on these foundations by integrating robust price security indicators with cutting-edge deep learning (DL) methodologies to reveal complex interdependencies. DL techniques examine intricate dynamics among diverse factors affecting food prices. Through sophisticated time-series forecasting models coupled with a classification model, our approach enhances existing models to better support communities worldwide in advancing their food security initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwanyoung Park, Youngwoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a compelling approach that addresses the challenge of learning from limited, static data by generating imaginary trajectories using learned models. However, it falls short in solving long-horizon tasks due to high bias in value estimation from model rollouts. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based offline RL method, Lower Expectile Q-learning (LEQ), which enhances long-horizon task performance by mitigating the high bias in model-based value estimation via expectile regression of $\lambda$-returns. Our empirical results show that LEQ significantly outperforms previous model-based offline RL methods on long-horizon tasks, such as the D4RL AntMaze tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of model-free approaches. Our experiments demonstrate that expectile regression, $\lambda$-returns, and critic training on offline data are all crucial for addressing long-horizon tasks. Additionally, LEQ achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model-based and model-free offline RL methods on the NeoRL benchmark and the D4RL MuJoCo Gym tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xikun Zhang, Dongjin Song, Yushan Jiang, Yixin Chen, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the trajectories of systems with unknown dynamics (\textit{i.e.} the governing rules) is crucial in various research fields, including physics and biology. This challenge has gathered significant attention from diverse communities. Most existing works focus on learning fixed system dynamics within one single system. However, real-world applications often involve multiple systems with different types of dynamics or evolving systems with non-stationary dynamics (dynamics shifts). When data from those systems are continuously collected and sequentially fed to machine learning models for training, these models tend to be biased toward the most recently learned dynamics, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously observed/learned system dynamics. To this end, we aim to learn system dynamics via continual learning. Specifically, we present a novel framework of Mode-switching Graph ODE (MS-GODE), which can continually learn varying dynamics and encode the system-specific dynamics into binary masks over the model parameters. During the inference stage, the model can select the most confident mask based on the observational data to identify the system and predict future trajectories accordingly. Empirically, we systematically investigate the task configurations and compare the proposed MS-GODE with state-of-the-art techniques. More importantly, we construct a novel benchmark of biological dynamic systems, featuring diverse systems with disparate dynamics and significantly enriching the research field of machine learning for dynamic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhao Lu, Rui Li, Andrew Wen, Jinlian Wang, Liwei Wang, Hongfang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various sectors, including healthcare where they are employed in diverse applications. Their utility is particularly significant in the context of rare diseases, where data scarcity, complexity, and specificity pose considerable challenges. In the clinical domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) stands out as an essential task and it plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from clinical texts. Despite the promise of LLMs, current research mostly concentrates on document-level NER, identifying entities in a more general context across entire documents, without extracting their precise location. Additionally, efforts have been directed towards adapting ChatGPT for token-level NER. However, there is a significant research gap when it comes to employing token-level NER for clinical texts, especially with the use of local open-source LLMs. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the effectiveness of both proprietary and local LLMs in token-level clinical NER. Essentially, we delve into the capabilities of these models through a series of experiments involving zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction-fine-tuning. Our exploration reveals the inherent challenges LLMs face in token-level NER, particularly in the context of rare diseases, and suggests possible improvements for their application in healthcare. This research contributes to narrowing a significant gap in healthcare informatics and offers insights that could lead to a more refined application of LLMs in the healthcare sector.</p>

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel method based on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating text summarization.

Our results show that LLMs evaluation aligns closely with human evaluation, while widely-used automatic metrics such as ROUGE-2, BERTScore, and SummaC do not and also lack consistency. Based on the empirical comparison, we propose a LLM-powered framework for automatically evaluating and improving text summarization, which is beneficial and could attract wide attention among the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation has important implications for generation of diverse and controllable images. Several attempts have been made to adapt Stable Diffusion (SD) to the medical domain. However, the large distribution difference between medical reports and natural texts, as well as high computational complexity in common stable diffusion limit the authenticity and feasibility of the generated medical images. To solve above problems, we propose a novel light-weight transformer-based diffusion model learning framework, Chest-Diffusion, for report-to-CXR generation. Chest-Diffusion employs a domain-specific text encoder to obtain accurate and expressive text features to guide image generation, improving the authenticity of the generated images. Meanwhile, we introduce a light-weight transformer architecture as the denoising model, reducing the computational complexity of the diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate that our Chest-Diffusion achieves the lowest FID score 24.456, under the computation budget of 118.918 GFLOPs, which is nearly one-third of the computational complexity of SD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) can be applied to raw text by exploiting the spatial arrangement of words in an embedding space. We investigate the implications of such text privatization on Language Models (LMs) and their tendency towards stereotypical associations. Since previous studies documented that linguistic proficiency correlates with stereotypical bias, one could assume that techniques for text privatization, which are known to degrade language modeling capabilities, would cancel out undesirable biases. By testing BERT models trained on texts containing biased statements primed with varying degrees of privacy, our study reveals that while stereotypical bias generally diminishes when privacy is tightened, text privatization does not uniformly equate to diminishing bias across all social domains. This highlights the need for careful diagnosis of bias in LMs that undergo text privatization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agust\'in Roca, Nicol\'as Ignacio Britos</p>
<p>Abstract: Innocence Project is a non-profitable organization that works in reducing wrongful convictions. In collaboration with Laboratorio de Sue\~no y Memoria from Instituto Tecnol\'ogico de Buenos Aires (ITBA), they are studying human memory in the context of face identification. They have a strong hypothesis stating that human memory heavily relies in face's frame to recognize faces. If this is proved, it could mean that face recognition in police lineups couldn't be trusted, as they may lead to wrongful convictions. This study uses experiments in order to try to prove this using faces with different properties, such as eyes size, but maintaining its frame as much as possible.
  In this project, we continue the work from a previous project that provided the basic tool to generate realistic faces using StyleGAN2. We take a deep dive into the internals of this tool to make full use of StyleGAN2 functionalities, while also adding more features, such as modifying certain of its attributes, including mouth-opening or eye-opening.
  As the usage of this tool heavily relies on maintaining the face-frame, we develop a way to identify the face-frame of each image and a function to compare it to the output of the neural network after applying some operations.
  We conclude that the face-frame is maintained when modifying eye-opening or mouth opening. When modifying vertical face orientation, gender, age and smile, have a considerable impact on its frame variation. And finally, the horizontal face orientation shows a major impact on the face-frame. This way, the Lab may apply some operations being confident that the face-frame won't significantly change, making them viable to be used to deceive subjects' memories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by advancements in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in effectively tackling distribution system restoration (DSR) challenges under uncertain operational scenarios. However, the data-intensive nature of DRL poses obstacles in achieving satisfactory DSR solutions for large-scale, complex distribution systems. Inspired by the transformative impact of emerging foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), across various domains, this paper explores an innovative approach harnessing LLMs' powerful computing capabilities to address scalability challenges inherent in conventional DRL methods for solving DSR. To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of foundation models, including LLMs, in revolutionizing conventional DRL applications in power system operations. Our contributions are twofold: 1) introducing a novel LLM-powered Physics-Informed Decision Transformer (PIDT) framework that leverages LLMs to transform conventional DRL methods for DSR operations, and 2) conducting comparative studies to assess the performance of the proposed LLM-powered PIDT framework at its initial development stage for solving DSR problems. While our primary focus in this paper is on DSR operations, the proposed PIDT framework can be generalized to optimize sequential decision-making across various power system operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems play an important role in next generation communication networks due to their ability to provide extensive global coverage with guaranteed communications in remote areas and isolated areas where base stations cannot be cost-efficiently deployed. With the pervasive adoption of LEO satellite systems, especially in the LEO Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios, their spectrum resource management requirements have become more complex as a result of massive service requests and high bandwidth demand from terrestrial terminals. For instance, when leasing the spectrum to terrestrial users and controlling the uplink transmit power, satellites collect user data for machine learning purposes, which usually are sensitive information such as location, budget and quality of service (QoS) requirement. To facilitate model training in LEO IoT while preserving the privacy of data, blockchain-driven federated learning (FL) is widely used by leveraging on a fully decentralized architecture. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spectrum pricing and power control framework for LEO IoT by combining blockchain technology and FL. We first design a local deep reinforcement learning algorithm for LEO satellite systems to learn a revenue-maximizing pricing and power control scheme. Then the agents collaborate to form a FL system. We also propose a reputation-based blockchain which is used in the global model aggregation phase of FL. Based on the reputation mechanism, a node is selected for each global training round to perform model aggregation and block generation, which can further enhance the decentralization of the network and guarantee the trust. Simulation tests are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Crupi, Luca Butera, Alberto Ferrante, Daniele Palossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart farming and precision agriculture represent game-changer technologies for efficient and sustainable agribusiness. Miniaturized palm-sized drones can act as flexible smart sensors inspecting crops, looking for early signs of potential pest outbreaking. However, achieving such an ambitious goal requires hardware-software codesign to develop accurate deep learning (DL) detection models while keeping memory and computational needs under an ultra-tight budget, i.e., a few MB on-chip memory and a few 100s mW power envelope. This work presents a novel vertically integrated solution featuring two ultra-low power System-on-Chips (SoCs), i.e., the dual-core STM32H74 and a multi-core GWT GAP9, running two State-of-the-Art DL models for detecting the Popillia japonica bug. We fine-tune both models for our image-based detection task, quantize them in 8-bit integers, and deploy them on the two SoCs. On the STM32H74, we deploy a FOMO-MobileNetV2 model, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.66 and running at 16.1 frame/s within 498 mW. While on the GAP9 SoC, we deploy a more complex SSDLite-MobileNetV3, which scores an mAP of 0.79 and peaks at 6.8 frame/s within 33 mW. Compared to a top-notch RetinaNet-ResNet101-FPN full-precision baseline, which requires 14.9x more memory and 300x more operations per inference, our best model drops only 15\% in mAP, paving the way toward autonomous palm-sized drones capable of lightweight and precise pest detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badreddine Yacine Yacheur (LaBRI), Toufik Ahmed (LaBRI), Mohamed Mosbah (LaBRI)</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative intelligent transport systems rely on a set of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications to enhance road safety. Emerging new V2X applications like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Connected Autonomous Driving (CAD) applications depend on a significant amount of shared data and require high reliability, low end-to-end (E2E) latency, and high throughput. However, present V2X communication technologies such as ITS-G5 and C-V2X (Cellular V2X) cannot satisfy these requirements alone. In this paper, we propose an intelligent, scalable hybrid vehicular communication architecture that leverages the performance of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) to meet the needs of these applications. Then, we propose a communication mode selection algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximize the network's reliability while limiting resource consumption. Finally, we assess our work using the platooning scenario that requires high reliability. Numerical results reveal that the hybrid vehicular communication architecture has the potential to enhance the packet reception rate (PRR) by up to 30% compared to both the static RAT selection strategy and the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) selection algorithm. Additionally, it improves the efficiency of the redundant communication mode by 20% regarding resource consumption</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Chen, Wangyou Zhang, Yifan Peng, Xinjian Li, Jinchuan Tian, Jiatong Shi, Xuankai Chang, Soumi Maiti, Karen Livescu, Shinji Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has helped extend speech technologies to more languages by reducing the need for labeled data. However, models are still far from supporting the world's 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT 2.0 v2 by 0.8% and 4.4% respectively, despite having less parameters or pre-training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Li, Shangjie Li, Binbin Xie, Deyi Xiong, Baosong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly catered to high-resource languages, leaving a disparity in performance for low-resource languages. Conventional Continual Training (CT) approaches to bridge this gap often undermine a model's original linguistic proficiency when expanding to multilingual contexts. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel MoE-CT architecture, a paradigm that innovatively separates the base model's learning from the multilingual expansion process. Our design freezes the original LLM parameters, thus safeguarding its performance in high-resource languages, while an appended MoE module, trained on diverse language datasets, augments low-resource language proficiency. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional CT methods, as evidenced by our experiments, which show marked improvements in multilingual benchmarks without sacrificing the model's original language performance. Moreover, our MoE-CT framework demonstrates enhanced resistance to forgetting and superior transfer learning capabilities. By preserving the base model's integrity and focusing on strategic parameter expansion, our methodology advances multilingual language modeling and represents a significant step forward for low-resource language inclusion in LLMs, indicating a fruitful direction for future research in language technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models recently reached state-of-the-art single-channel speech separation accuracy; However, their extreme computational load makes it difficult to deploy them in resource-constrained mobile or IoT devices. We thus present Papez, a lightweight and computation-efficient single-channel speech separation model. Papez is based on three key techniques. We first replace the inter-chunk Transformer with small-sized auditory working memory. Second, we adaptively prune the input tokens that do not need further processing. Finally, we reduce the number of parameters through the recurrent transformer. Our extensive evaluation shows that Papez achieves the best resource and accuracy tradeoffs with a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Li, Gang Li, Zirui Wen, Shuangfeng Han, Shijian Gao, Guangyi Liu, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The AI-enabled autoencoder has demonstrated great potential in channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. However, this method completely changes the existing feedback strategies, making it impractical to deploy in recent years. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel modeling aided data augmentation method based on a limited number of field channel data. Specifically, the user equipment (UE) extracts the primary stochastic parameters of the field channel data and transmits them to the base station (BS). The BS then updates the typical TR 38.901 model parameters with the extracted parameters. In this way, the updated channel model is used to generate the dataset. This strategy comprehensively considers the dataset collection, model generalization, model monitoring, and so on. Simulations verify that our proposed strategy can significantly improve performance compared to the benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Considering such modality impact, we further utilize modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also identify that demonstration selection is closely related to the models' ability to capture task inductive biases from multimodal ICL. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks even if those tasks are not seen in or even contradict pretraining data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwanjun Song, Hang Su, Igor Shalyminov, Jason Cai, Saab Mansour</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Deng, Qi Li, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks identify the websites visited by users by performing traffic analysis, compromising user privacy. Particularly, DL-based WF attacks demonstrate impressive attack performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based WF attacks relies on the collected complete and pure traffic during the page loading, which impacts the practicality of these attacks. The WF performance is rather low under dynamic network conditions and various WF defenses, particularly when the analyzed traffic is only a small part of the complete traffic. In this paper, we propose Holmes, a robust and reliable early-stage WF attack. Holmes utilizes temporal and spatial distribution analysis of website traffic to effectively identify websites in the early stages of page loading. Specifically, Holmes develops adaptive data augmentation based on the temporal distribution of website traffic and utilizes a supervised contrastive learning method to extract the correlations between the early-stage traffic and the pre-collected complete traffic. Holmes accurately identifies traffic in the early stages of page loading by computing the correlation of the traffic with the spatial distribution information, which ensures robust and reliable detection according to early-stage traffic. We extensively evaluate Holmes using six datasets. Compared to nine existing DL-based WF attacks, Holmes improves the F1-score of identifying early-stage traffic by an average of 169.18%. Furthermore, we replay the traffic of visiting real-world dark web websites. Holmes successfully identifies dark web websites when the ratio of page loading on average is only 21.71%, with an average precision improvement of 169.36% over the existing WF attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) signifies a pivotal advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, enhancing the ability to capture and utilize complex knowledge structures. This synergy leverages the advanced linguistic and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to improve the accuracy, adaptability, and efficacy of KRL, thereby expanding its applications and potential. Despite the increasing volume of research focused on embedding LLMs within the domain of knowledge representation, a thorough review that examines the fundamental components and processes of these enhanced models is conspicuously absent. Our survey addresses this by categorizing these models based on three distinct Transformer architectures, and by analyzing experimental data from various KRL downstream tasks to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, we identify and explore potential future research directions in this emerging yet underexplored domain, proposing pathways for continued progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanush Chopra, Michael Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for evaluating strategic deception in large language models (LLMs). In this framework, an LLM acts as a game master in two scenarios: one with random game mechanics and another where it can choose between random or deliberate actions. As an example, we use blackjack because the action space nor strategies involve deception. We benchmark Llama3-70B, GPT-4-Turbo, and Mixtral in blackjack, comparing outcomes against expected distributions in fair play to determine if LLMs develop strategies favoring the "house." Our findings reveal that the LLMs exhibit significant deviations from fair play when given implicit randomness instructions, suggesting a tendency towards strategic manipulation in ambiguous scenarios. However, when presented with an explicit choice, the LLMs largely adhere to fair play, indicating that the framing of instructions plays a crucial role in eliciting or mitigating potentially deceptive behaviors in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Jiao, Dingzhu Wen, Guangxu Zhu, Wei Jiang, Wu Luo, Yuanming Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge-device co-inference, which concerns the cooperation between edge devices and an edge server for completing inference tasks over wireless networks, has been a promising technique for enabling various kinds of intelligent services at the network edge, e.g., auto-driving. In this paradigm, the concerned design objective of the network shifts from the traditional communication throughput to the effective and efficient execution of the inference task underpinned by the network, measured by, e.g., the inference accuracy and latency. In this paper, a task-oriented over-the-air computation scheme is proposed for a multidevice artificial intelligence system. Particularly, a novel tractable inference accuracy metric is proposed for classification tasks, which is called minimum pair-wise discriminant gain. Unlike prior work measuring the average of all class pairs in feature space, it measures the minimum distance of all class pairs. By maximizing the minimum pair-wise discriminant gain instead of its average counterpart, any pair of classes can be better separated in the feature space, and thus leading to a balanced and improved inference accuracy for all classes. Besides, this paper jointly optimizes the minimum discriminant gain of all feature elements instead of separately maximizing that of each element in the existing designs. As a result, the transmit power can be adaptively allocated to the feature elements according to their different contributions to the inference accuracy, opening an extra degree of freedom to improve inference performance. Extensive experiments are conducted using a concrete use case of human motion recognition to verify the superiority of the proposed design over the benchmarking scheme.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data limitation is a significant challenge in applying deep learning to medical images. Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Individual brains vary greatly in morphology, connectivity and organization. The applicability of group-level parcellations is limited by the rapid development of precision medicine today because they do not take into account the variation of parcels at the individual level. Accurate mapping of brain functional regions at the individual level is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of the variations in brain function and behaviors, early and precise identification of brain abnormalities, as well as personalized treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. With the development of neuroimaging and machine learning techniques, studies on individual brain parcellation are booming. In this paper, we offer an overview of recent advances in the methodologies of individual brain parcellation, including optimization- and learning-based methods. Comprehensive evaluation metrics to validate individual brain mapping have been introduced. We also review the studies of how individual brain mapping promotes neuroscience research and clinical medicine. Finally, we summarize the major challenges and important future directions of individualized brain parcellation. Collectively, we intend to offer a thorough overview of individual brain parcellation methods, validations, and applications, along with highlighting the current challenges that call for an urgent demand for integrated platforms that integrate datasets, methods, and validations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqiang Zu, Shenghao Xie, Qing Zhao, Guoqi Li, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: \textbf{Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator.} And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method. Our code will be released once accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yenan Chen, Chuye Zhang, Pengxi Gu, Jianuo Qiu, Jiayi Yin, Nuofan Qiu, Guojing Huang, Bangchao Huang, Zishang Zhang, Hui Deng, Wei Zhang, Fang Wan, Chaoyang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: While the animals' Fin-to-Limb evolution has been well-researched in biology, such morphological transformation remains under-adopted in the modern design of advanced robotic limbs. This paper investigates a novel class of overconstrained locomotion from a design and learning perspective inspired by evolutionary morphology, aiming to integrate the concept of `intelligent design under constraints' - hereafter referred to as constraint-driven design intelligence - in developing modern robotic limbs with superior energy efficiency. We propose a 3D-printable design of robotic limbs parametrically reconfigurable as a classical planar 4-bar linkage, an overconstrained Bennett linkage, and a spherical 4-bar linkage. These limbs adopt a co-axial actuation, identical to the modern legged robot platforms, with the added capability of upgrading into a wheel-legged system. Then, we implemented a large-scale, multi-terrain deep reinforcement learning framework to train these reconfigurable limbs for a comparative analysis of overconstrained locomotion in energy efficiency. Results show that the overconstrained limbs exhibit more efficient locomotion than planar limbs during forward and sideways walking over different terrains, including floors, slopes, and stairs, with or without random noises, by saving at least 22% mechanical energy in completing the traverse task, with the spherical limbs being the least efficient. It also achieves the highest average speed of 0.85 meters per second on flat terrain, which is 20% faster than the planar limbs. This study paves the path for an exciting direction for future research in overconstrained robotics leveraging evolutionary morphology and reconfigurable mechanism intelligence when combined with state-of-the-art methods in deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Zhuoru Li, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformers (\textbf{DiT}s) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the convergence rate and the computational efficiency are both dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqi Xu, Tianchi Cai, Jiyan Jiang, Xierui Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing issue of factual inconsistency errors in conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) motivates the study of Factual Consistency Evaluation (FCE). Despite the various FCE methods proposed earlier, these methods are evaluated on datasets generated by specific Large Language Models (LLMs). Without a comprehensive benchmark, it remains unexplored how these FCE methods perform on other LLMs with different error distributions or even unseen error types, as these methods may fail to detect the error types generated by other LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first comprehensive FCE benchmark \emph{Face4RAG} for RAG independent of the underlying LLM. Our benchmark consists of a synthetic dataset built upon a carefully designed typology for factuality inconsistency error and a real-world dataset constructed from six commonly used LLMs, enabling evaluation of FCE methods on specific error types or real-world error distributions. On the proposed benchmark, we discover the failure of existing FCE methods to detect the logical fallacy, which refers to a mismatch of logic structures between the answer and the retrieved reference. To fix this issue, we further propose a new method called \emph{L-Face4RAG} with two novel designs of logic-preserving answer decomposition and fact-logic FCE. Extensive experiments show L-Face4RAG substantially outperforms previous methods for factual inconsistency detection on a wide range of tasks, notably beyond the RAG task from which it is originally motivated. Both the benchmark and our proposed method are publicly available.\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/yq27/Face4RAG}\label{link_face4rag}}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Drokin</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) has sparked significant interest and debate within the scientific community. This paper explores the application of KANs in the domain of computer vision (CV). We examine the convolutional version of KANs, considering various nonlinearity options beyond splines, such as Wavelet transforms and a range of polynomials. We propose a parameter-efficient design for Kolmogorov-Arnold convolutional layers and a parameter-efficient finetuning algorithm for pre-trained KAN models, as well as KAN convolutional versions of self-attention and focal modulation layers. We provide empirical evaluations conducted on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet1k, and HAM10000 datasets for image classification tasks. Additionally, we explore segmentation tasks, proposing U-Net-like architectures with KAN convolutions, and achieving state-of-the-art results on BUSI, GlaS, and CVC datasets. We summarized all of our findings in a preliminary design guide of KAN convolutional models for computer vision tasks. Furthermore, we investigate regularization techniques for KANs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Li-Min Lin, Zhengshan Xu, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Zhichao Chen, Yuan Shen, Jiajun Fan, Zhaoran Liu, Degui Yang, Xinggao Liu, Haoxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation from observational data poses significant challenges due to treatment selection bias. Existing methods address this bias by minimizing distribution discrepancies between treatment groups in latent space, focusing on global alignment. However, the fruitful aspect of local proximity, where similar units exhibit similar outcomes, is often overlooked. In this study, we propose Proximity-aware Counterfactual Regression (PCR) to exploit proximity for representation balancing within the HTE estimation context. Specifically, we introduce a local proximity preservation regularizer based on optimal transport to depict the local proximity in discrepancy calculation. Furthermore, to overcome the curse of dimensionality that renders the estimation of discrepancy ineffective, exacerbated by limited data availability for HTE estimation, we develop an informative subspace projector, which trades off minimal distance precision for improved sample complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR accurately matches units across different treatment groups, effectively mitigates treatment selection bias, and significantly outperforms competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Marco, Julio Gonzalo, Ram\'on del Castillo, Mar\'ia Teresa Mateo Girona</p>
<p>Abstract: It has become routine to report research results where Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform average humans in a wide range of language-related tasks, and creative text writing is no exception. It seems natural, then, to raise the bid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (rather than average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we have carried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered one of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs), in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee Sidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write short stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared an evaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and we collected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars. The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from challenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level of autonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply with larger language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadezhda Chirkova, Vassilina Nikoulina, Jean-Luc Meunier, Alexandre B\'erard</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on multi-domain Neural Machine Translation, with the goal of developing efficient models which can handle data from various domains seen during training and are robust to domains unseen during training. We hypothesize that Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models are a good fit for this task, as they enable efficient model scaling, which helps to accommodate a variety of multi-domain data, and allow flexible sharing of parameters between domains, potentially enabling knowledge transfer between similar domains and limiting negative transfer. We conduct a series of experiments aimed at validating the utility of SMoE for the multi-domain scenario, and find that a straightforward width scaling of Transformer is a simpler and surprisingly more efficient approach in practice, and reaches the same performance level as SMoE. We also search for a better recipe for robustness of multi-domain systems, highlighting the importance of mixing-in a generic domain, i.e. Paracrawl, and introducing a simple technique, domain randomization.</p>

In this paper, we formulate PAVI as a generation task and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive evaluation of PAVI so far. We compare three different attribute-value generation (AVG) strategies based on fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on three datasets. Experiments show that end-to-end AVG approach, which is computationally efficient, outperforms other strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanli Li, Tahereh Hassanzadeh, Denis P. Shamonin, Monique Reijnierse, Annette H. M. van der Helm-van Mil, Berend C. Stoel</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the decisions of deep learning (DL) models is essential for the acceptance of DL to risk-sensitive applications. Although methods, like class activation maps (CAMs), give a glimpse into the black box, they do miss some crucial information, thereby limiting its interpretability and merely providing the considered locations of objects. To provide more insight into the models and the influence of datasets, we propose an integrated feature analysis method, which consists of feature distribution analysis and feature decomposition, to look closer into the intermediate features extracted by DL models. This integrated feature analysis could provide information on overfitting, confounders, outliers in datasets, model redundancies and principal features extracted by the models, and provide distribution information to form a common intensity scale, which are missing in current CAM algorithms. The integrated feature analysis was applied to eight different datasets for general validation: photographs of handwritten digits, two datasets of natural images and five medical datasets, including skin photography, ultrasound, CT, X-rays and MRIs. The method was evaluated by calculating the consistency between the CAMs average class activation levels and the logits of the model. Based on the eight datasets, the correlation coefficients through our method were all very close to 100%, and based on the feature decomposition, 5%-25% of features could generate equally informative saliency maps and obtain the same model performances as using all features. This proves the reliability of the integrated feature analysis. As the proposed methods rely on very few assumptions, this is a step towards better model interpretation and a useful extension to existing CAM algorithms. Codes: https://github.com/YanliLi27/IFA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Schr\"ufer, Manuel Milling, Felix Burkhardt, Florian Eyben, Bj\"orn Schuller</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is an important building block for the reliable use of neural networks in real-world scenarios, as it can be a useful tool in identifying faulty predictions. Speech emotion recognition (SER) models can suffer from particularly many sources of uncertainty, such as the ambiguity of emotions, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data or, in general, poor recording conditions. Reliable UQ methods are thus of particular interest as in many SER applications no prediction is better than a faulty prediction. While the effects of label ambiguity on uncertainty are well documented in the literature, we focus our work on an evaluation of UQ methods for SER under common challenges in real-world application, such as corrupted signals, and the absence of speech. We show that simple UQ methods can already give an indication of the uncertainty of a prediction and that training with additional OOD data can greatly improve the identification of such signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Utilizing a shared embedding space, emerging multimodal models exhibit unprecedented zero-shot capabilities. However, the shared embedding space could lead to new vulnerabilities if different modalities can be misaligned. In this paper, we extend and utilize a recently developed effective gradient-based procedure that allows us to match the embedding of a given text by minimally modifying an image. Using the procedure, we show that we can align the embeddings of distinguishable texts to any image through unnoticeable adversarial attacks in joint image-text models, revealing that semantically unrelated images can have embeddings of identical texts and at the same time visually indistinguishable images can be matched to the embeddings of very different texts. Our technique achieves 100\% success rate when it is applied to text datasets and images from multiple sources. Without overcoming the vulnerability, multimodal models cannot robustly align inputs from different modalities in a semantically meaningful way. \textbf{Warning: the text data used in this paper are toxic in nature and may be offensive to some readers.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalibinuer Tiliwalidi, Chengyin Hu, Weiwen Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: While extensive research exists on physical adversarial attacks within the visible spectrum, studies on such techniques in the infrared spectrum are limited. Infrared object detectors are vital in modern technological applications but are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant security threats. Previous studies using physical perturbations like light bulb arrays and aerogels for white-box attacks, or hot and cold patches for black-box attacks, have proven impractical or limited in multi-view support. To address these issues, we propose the Adversarial Infrared Grid (AdvGrid), which models perturbations in a grid format and uses a genetic algorithm for black-box optimization. These perturbations are cyclically applied to various parts of a pedestrian's clothing to facilitate multi-view black-box physical attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors. Extensive experiments validate AdvGrid's effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. The method achieves attack success rates of 80.00\% in digital environments and 91.86\% in physical environments, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, the average attack success rate exceeds 50\% against mainstream detectors, demonstrating AdvGrid's robustness. Our analyses include ablation studies, transfer attacks, and adversarial defenses, confirming the method's superiority.</p>

<p>Abstract: The training and inference of large language models (LLMs) are together a costly process that transports knowledge from raw data to meaningful computation. Inspired by the memory hierarchy of the human brain, we reduce this cost by equipping LLMs with explicit memory, a memory format cheaper than model parameters and text retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Conceptually, with most of its knowledge externalized to explicit memories, the LLM can enjoy a smaller parameter size, training cost, and inference cost, all proportional to the amount of remaining "abstract knowledge". As a preliminary proof of concept, we train from scratch a 2.4B LLM, which achieves better performance than much larger LLMs as well as RAG models, and maintains higher decoding speed than RAG. The model is named $\text{Memory}^3$, since explicit memory is the third form of memory in LLMs after implicit memory (model parameters) and working memory (context key-values). We introduce a memory circuitry theory to support the externalization of knowledge, and present novel techniques including a memory sparsification mechanism that makes storage tractable and a two-stage pretraining scheme that facilitates memory formation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Precise perception of articulated objects is vital for empowering service robots.

To address these limitations, we introduce MARS, a novel framework for articulated object characterization.

In experiments conducted with various articulated object instances from the PartNet-Mobility dataset, our method outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in joint parameter estimation accuracy. Additionally, through active sensing, MARS further reduces errors, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in handling suboptimal viewpoints. Furthermore, our method effectively generalizes to real-world articulated objects, enhancing robot interactions. Code is available at https://github.com/robhlzeng/MARS.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit a simple idea for machine learning on graphs, where a random walk on a graph produces a machine-readable record, and this record is processed by a deep neural network to directly make vertex-level or graph-level predictions. We refer to these stochastic machines as random walk neural networks, and show that we can design them to be isomorphism invariant while capable of universal approximation of graph functions in probability. A useful finding is that almost any kind of record of random walk guarantees probabilistic invariance as long as the vertices are anonymized. This enables us to record random walks in plain text and adopt a language model to read these text records to solve graph tasks. We further establish a parallelism to message passing neural networks using tools from Markov chain theory, and show that over-smoothing in message passing is alleviated by construction in random walk neural networks, while over-squashing manifests as probabilistic under-reaching. We show that random walk neural networks based on pre-trained language models can solve several hard problems on graphs, such as separating strongly regular graphs where the 3-WL test fails, counting substructures, and transductive classification on arXiv citation network without training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xibo Li, Shruti Patel, Christof B\"uskens</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) allows a system to interact with its environment and take actions by training an efficient policy that maximizes self-defined rewards. In autonomous driving, it can be used as a strategy for high-level decision making, whereas low-level algorithms such as the hybrid A* path planning have proven their ability to solve the local trajectory planning problem. In this work, we combine these two methods where the DRL makes high-level decisions such as lane change commands. After obtaining the lane change command, the hybrid A* planner is able to generate a collision-free trajectory to be executed by a model predictive controller (MPC). In addition, the DRL algorithm is able to keep the lane change command consistent within a chosen time-period. Traffic rules are implemented using linear temporal logic (LTL), which is then utilized as a reward function in DRL. Furthermore, we validate the proposed method on a real system to demonstrate its feasibility from simulation to implementation on real hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Ye, Ziniu Hu, Yihe Deng, Zijie Huang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanqiao Zhu, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems. Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale. Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability. To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events. Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles. We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting. We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Liang, Wenyu Chen, Jian Fang, Huaici Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The single-stage point-based 3D object detectors have attracted widespread research interest due to their advantages of lightweight and fast inference speed. However, they still face challenges such as inadequate learning of low-quality objects (ILQ) and misalignment between localization accuracy and classification confidence (MLC). In this paper, we propose SGCCNet to alleviate these two issues. For ILQ, SGCCNet adopts a Saliency-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA) strategy to enhance the robustness of the model on low-quality objects by reducing its reliance on salient features. Specifically, We construct a classification task and then approximate the saliency scores of points by moving points towards the point cloud centroid in a differentiable process. During the training process, SGCCNet will be forced to learn from low saliency features through dropping points. Meanwhile, to avoid internal covariate shift and contextual features forgetting caused by dropping points, we add a geometric normalization module and skip connection block in each stage. For MLC, we design a Confidence Correction Mechanism (CCM) specifically for point-based multi-class detectors. This mechanism corrects the confidence of the current proposal by utilizing the predictions of other key points within the local region in the post-processing stage. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our SGCCNet. On the KITTI \textit{test} set, SGCCNet achieves $80.82\%$ for the metric of $AP_{3D}$ on the \textit{Moderate} level, outperforming all other point-based detectors, surpassing IA-SSD and Fast Point R-CNN by $2.35\%$ and $3.42\%$, respectively. Additionally, SGCCNet demonstrates excellent portability for other point-based detectors</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajie Chen, Tianqing Zhu, Lefeng Zhang, Bo Liu, Derui Wang, Wanlei Zhou, Minhui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Model extraction attacks currently pose a non-negligible threat to the security and privacy of deep learning models. By querying the model with a small dataset and usingthe query results as the ground-truth labels, an adversary can steal a piracy model with performance comparable to the original model. Two key issues that cause the threat are, on the one hand, accurate and unlimited queries can be obtained by the adversary; on the other hand, the adversary can aggregate the query results to train the model step by step. The existing defenses usually employ model watermarking or fingerprinting to protect the ownership. However, these methods cannot proactively prevent the violation from happening. To mitigate the threat, we propose QUEEN (QUEry unlEarNing) that proactively launches counterattacks on potential model extraction attacks from the very beginning. To limit the potential threat, QUEEN has sensitivity measurement and outputs perturbation that prevents the adversary from training a piracy model with high performance. In sensitivity measurement, QUEEN measures the single query sensitivity by its distance from the center of its cluster in the feature space. To reduce the learning accuracy of attacks, for the highly sensitive query batch, QUEEN applies query unlearning, which is implemented by gradient reverse to perturb the softmax output such that the piracy model will generate reverse gradients to worsen its performance unconsciously. Experiments show that QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses against various model extraction attacks with a relatively low cost to the model accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serene Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the subtle and often concealed biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs), which, despite passing explicit bias tests, can still exhibit implicit biases akin to those observed in humans who profess egalitarian beliefs yet demonstrate underlying prejudices. The challenge of measuring such biases is exacerbated as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, restricting access to their internal mechanisms such as embeddings, which are crucial for applying traditional bias measures. To tackle these issues, this study introduces innovative measures of bias inspired by psychological methodologies: the LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and the LLM Decision Bias. The LLM IAT Bias is a prompt-based method designed to unearth implicit biases by simulating the well-known psychological IAT but adapted for use with LLMs. The LLM Decision Bias measure is developed to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks, focusing on how LLMs choose between individuals in various scenarios. Open-ended generation is also utilised through thematic analysis of word generations and storytelling. The experiments revealed biases across gender and racial domains, from discriminatory categorisations to exoticisation. Our findings indicate that the prompt-based measure of implicit bias not only correlates with traditional embedding-based methods but also more effectively predicts downstream behaviors, which are crucially measured by the LLM Decision Bias. This relationship underscores the importance of relative, rather than absolute, evaluations in assessing implicit biases, reflecting psychological insights into human bias assessment. This research contributes to the broader understanding of AI ethics and provides suggestions for continually assessing and mitigating biases in advanced AI systems, emphasising the need for more qualitative and downstream focus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilia Heikkinen, Elsa Silvennoinen, Imran Khan, Zakaria Lemhaouri, Laura Cohen, Lola Ca\~namero, Robert Lowe</p>
<p>Abstract: Owing to the recent success of Large Language Models, Modern A.I has been much focused on linguistic interactions with humans but less focused on non-linguistic forms of communication between man and machine. In the present paper, we test how affective-linguistic communication, in combination with differential outcomes training, affects mutual learning in a human-robot context. Taking inspiration from child-caregiver dynamics, our human-robot interaction setup consists of a (simulated) robot attempting to learn how best to communicate internal, homeostatically-controlled needs; while a human "caregiver" attempts to learn the correct object to satisfy the robot's present communicated need. We studied the effects of i) human training type, and ii) robot reinforcement learning type, to assess mutual learning terminal accuracy and rate of learning (as measured by the average reward achieved by the robot). Our results find mutual learning between a human and a robot is significantly improved with Differential Outcomes Training (DOT) compared to Non-DOT (control) conditions. We find further improvements when the robot uses an exploration-exploitation policy selection, compared to purely exploitation policy selection. These findings have implications for utilizing socially assistive robots (SAR) in therapeutic contexts, e.g. for cognitive interventions, and educational applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangrui Yang, Jianfei Li, Ming Li, Han Feng, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the approximation theory of functions defined on graphs. Our study builds upon the approximation results derived from the $K$-functional. We establish a theoretical framework to assess the lower bounds of approximation for target functions using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and examine the over-smoothing phenomenon commonly observed in these networks. Initially, we introduce the concept of a $K$-functional on graphs, establishing its equivalence to the modulus of smoothness. We then analyze a typical type of GCN to demonstrate how the high-frequency energy of the output decays, an indicator of over-smoothing. This analysis provides theoretical insights into the nature of over-smoothing within GCNs. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for the approximation of target functions by GCNs, which is governed by the modulus of smoothness of these functions. This finding offers a new perspective on the approximation capabilities of GCNs. In our numerical experiments, we analyze several widely applied GCNs and observe the phenomenon of energy decay. These observations corroborate our theoretical results on exponential decay order.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menglin Yang, Harshit Verma, Delvin Ce Zhang, Jiahong Liu, Irwin King, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry have shown significant potential in modeling complex structured data, particularly those with underlying tree-like and hierarchical structures. Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural networks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to hyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on modifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts have fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems primarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space, including linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions, dropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing hyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which hinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a novel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry. In Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential modules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a linear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic Transformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for the first time. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Hypformer across various datasets, demonstrating its potential as an effective and scalable solution for large-scale data representation and large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the performance of large language models across diverse downstream tasks has emerged as a pivotal challenge in NLP research. The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Kimhi, David Vainshtein, Chaim Baskin, Dotan Di Castro</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end neural speaker diarization systems are able to address the speaker diarization task while effectively handling speech overlap. This work explores the incorporation of speaker information embeddings into the end-to-end systems to enhance the speaker discriminative capabilities, while maintaining their overlap handling strengths.

Furthermore, we delve into an analysis of the correct handling of silence frames, the window length for extracting speaker embeddings and the transformer encoder size. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on the CallHome dataset for the two-speaker diarization task, with results that demonstrate a significant reduction in diarization error rates achieving a relative improvement of a 10.78% compared to the baseline end-to-end model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for medical imaging has provided a leap forward in diagnosis, providing a safe, non-invasive alternative to techniques involving ionising radiation exposure for diagnostic purposes. It was described by Block and Purcel in 1946, and it was not until 1980 that the first clinical application of MRI became available. Since that time the MRI has gone through many advances and has altered the way diagnosing procedures are performed. Due to its ability to improve constantly, MRI has become a commonly used practice among several specialisations in medicine. Particularly starting 0.55T and 7T MRI technologies have pointed out enhanced preservation of image detail and advanced tissue characterisation. This review examines the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques into these MRI modalities, disseminating and exploring the study applications. It highlights how DL contributes to 0.55T and 7T MRI data, showcasing the potential of DL in improving and refining these technologies. The review ends with a brief overview of how MRI technology will evolve in the coming years.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models, such as the 175B GPT-3, has attracted more attention for downstream tasks recently. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been proposed and proven effective without retraining all model parameters, their performance is limited by the capacity of incremental modules, especially under constrained parameter budgets. \\ To overcome this challenge, we propose CapaBoost, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances model capacity by leveraging low-rank updates through parallel weight modules in target layers. By applying static random masks to the shared weight matrix, CapaBoost constructs a diverse set of weight matrices, effectively increasing the rank of incremental weights without adding parameters. Notably, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We extensively validate the efficacy of CapaBoost through experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and image classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, without incurring additional computation or storage costs. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/CapaBoost}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing inherently interpretable models for prediction has gained prominence in recent years. A subclass of these models, wherein the interpretable network relies on learning high-level concepts, are valued because of closeness of concept representations to human communication. However, the visualization and understanding of the learnt unsupervised dictionary of concepts encounters major limitations, specially for large-scale images. We propose here a novel method that relies on mapping the concept features to the latent space of a pretrained generative model. The use of a generative model enables high quality visualization, and naturally lays out an intuitive and interactive procedure for better interpretation of the learnt concepts. Furthermore, leveraging pretrained generative models has the additional advantage of making the training of the system more efficient. We quantitatively ascertain the efficacy of our method in terms of accuracy of the interpretable prediction network, fidelity of reconstruction, as well as faithfulness and consistency of learnt concepts. The experiments are conducted on multiple image recognition benchmarks for large-scale images. Project page available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/VisCoIN_project_page/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Callum Rhys Tilbury, Claude Formanek, Louise Beyers, Jonathan P. Shock, Arnu Pretorius</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) leverages static datasets of experience to learn optimal multi-agent control. However, learning from static data presents several unique challenges to overcome. In this paper, we focus on coordination failure and investigate the role of joint actions in multi-agent policy gradients with offline data, focusing on a common setting we refer to as the 'Best Response Under Data' (BRUD) approach. By using two-player polynomial games as an analytical tool, we demonstrate a simple yet overlooked failure mode of BRUD-based algorithms, which can lead to catastrophic coordination failure in the offline setting. Building on these insights, we propose an approach to mitigate such failure, by prioritising samples from the dataset based on joint-action similarity during policy learning and demonstrate its effectiveness in detailed experiments. More generally, however, we argue that prioritised dataset sampling is a promising area for innovation in offline MARL that can be combined with other effective approaches such as critic and policy regularisation. Importantly, our work shows how insights drawn from simplified, tractable games can lead to useful, theoretically grounded insights that transfer to more complex contexts. A core dimension of offering is an interactive notebook, from which almost all of our results can be reproduced, in a browser.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening consists of fusing a high-resolution panchromatic band and a low-resolution hyperspectral image to obtain a new image with high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains. These remote sensing products are valuable for a wide range of applications, driving ever growing research efforts. Nonetheless, results still do not meet application demands. In part, this comes from the technical complexity of the task: compared to multispectral pansharpening, many more bands are involved, in a spectral range only partially covered by the panchromatic component and with overwhelming noise. However, another major limiting factor is the absence of a comprehensive framework for the rapid development and accurate evaluation of new methods. This paper attempts to address this issue.
  We started by designing a dataset large and diverse enough to allow reliable training (for data-driven methods) and testing of new methods. Then, we selected a set of state-of-the-art methods, following different approaches, characterized by promising performance, and reimplemented them in a single PyTorch framework. Finally, we carried out a critical comparative analysis of all methods, using the most accredited quality indicators. The analysis highlights the main limitations of current solutions in terms of spectral/spatial quality and computational efficiency, and suggests promising research directions.
  To ensure full reproducibility of the results and support future research, the framework (including codes, evaluation procedures and links to the dataset) is shared on https://github.com/matciotola/hyperspectral_pansharpening_toolbox, as a single Python-based reference benchmark toolbox.</p>

Through techniques like uniform sampling, interpolation, and a memory-efficient training stage based on masking, we achieve improved recognition accuracy while minimizing computational overhead. Our experiments on Split NTU-60 and the proposed Split NTU-120 datasets demonstrate that CHARON sets a new benchmark in this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vitaly Bulgakov</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on methods to reduce the size and improve the quality of the prompt context required for question-answering systems. Attempts to increase the number of retrieved chunked documents and thereby enlarge the context related to the query can significantly complicate the processing and decrease the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) when generating responses to queries. It is well known that a large set of documents retrieved from a database in response to a query may contain irrelevant information, which often leads to hallucinations in the resulting answers. Our goal is to select the most semantically relevant documents, treating the discarded ones as outliers. We propose and evaluate several methods for identifying outliers by creating features that utilize the distances of embedding vectors, retrieved from the vector database, to both the centroid and the query vectors. The methods were evaluated by comparing the similarities of the retrieved LLM responses to ground-truth answers obtained using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. It was found that the greatest improvements were achieved with increasing complexity of the questions and answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Gurgurov, Mareike Hartmann, Simon Ostermann</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxwell Aladago, Lorenzo Torresani, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of vision-language contrastive learning, models such as CLIP capitalize on matched image-caption pairs as positive examples and leverage within-batch non-matching pairs as negatives. This approach has led to remarkable outcomes in zero-shot image classification, cross-modal retrieval, and linear evaluation tasks. We show that the zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of CLIP-like models can be improved significantly through the introduction of semantically composite examples during pretraining. Inspired by CutMix in vision categorization, we create semantically composite image-caption pairs by merging elements from two distinct instances in the dataset via a novel procedure. Our method fuses the captions and blends 50% of each image to form a new composite sample. This simple technique (termed CLIP-C for CLIP Compositions), devoid of any additional computational overhead or increase in model parameters, significantly improves zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. The benefits of CLIP-C are particularly pronounced in settings with relatively limited pretraining data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models present opportunities for innovative Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). However, they are not inherently designed for query generation. To bridge this gap, solutions have been proposed that rely on fine-tuning or ad-hoc architectures, achieving good results but limited out-of-domain distribution generalization. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Dynamic Few-Shot Learning (DFSL). DFSL integrates the efficiency of in-context learning and semantic similarity and provides a generally applicable solution for KGQA with state-of-the-art performance. We run an extensive evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and architecture configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Ai, Stephen Tian, Haochen Shi, Yixuan Wang, Cheston Tan, Yunzhu Li, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile feedback is critical for understanding the dynamics of both rigid and deformable objects in many manipulation tasks, such as non-prehensile manipulation and dense packing. We introduce an approach that combines visual and tactile sensing for robotic manipulation by learning a neural, tactile-informed dynamics model. Our proposed framework, RoboPack, employs a recurrent graph neural network to estimate object states, including particles and object-level latent physics information, from historical visuo-tactile observations and to perform future state predictions. Our tactile-informed dynamics model, learned from real-world data, can solve downstream robotics tasks with model-predictive control. We demonstrate our approach on a real robot equipped with a compliant Soft-Bubble tactile sensor on non-prehensile manipulation and dense packing tasks, where the robot must infer the physics properties of objects from direct and indirect interactions. Trained on only an average of 30 minutes of real-world interaction data per task, our model can perform online adaptation and make touch-informed predictions. Through extensive evaluations in both long-horizon dynamics prediction and real-world manipulation, our method demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to previous learning-based and physics-based simulation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Motahare Mounesan, Mauro Lemus, Hemanth Yeddulapalli, Prasad Calyam, Saptarshi Debroy</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, Volunteer Edge-Cloud (VEC) has gained traction as a cost-effective, community computing paradigm to support data-intensive scientific workflows. However, due to the highly distributed and heterogeneous nature of VEC resources, centralized workflow task scheduling remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven data-intensive scientific workflow scheduling approach that takes into consideration: i) workflow requirements, ii) VEC resources' preference on workflows, and iii) diverse VEC resource policies, to ensure robust resource allocation. We formulate the long-term average performance optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process, which is solved using an event-based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic RL approach. Our extensive simulations and testbed implementations demonstrate our approach's benefits over popular baseline strategies in terms of workflow requirement satisfaction, VEC preference satisfaction, and available VEC resource utilization.</p>

As a case study we test LARIMAR, a recently proposed LLM architecture which augments a LLM decoder with an external associative memory, on several long-context recall tasks, including passkey and needle-in-the-haystack tests. We demonstrate that the external memory can be adapted at test time to handle contexts much longer than those seen during training, while keeping readouts from the memory recognizable to the trained decoder and without increasing GPU memory footprint. Compared to alternative architectures for long-context recall tasks with models of a comparable parameter count, LARIMAR is able to maintain strong performance without any task-specific training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural scaling laws aim to characterize how out-of-sample error behaves as a function of model and training dataset size. Such scaling laws guide allocation of a computational resources between model and data processing to minimize error. However, existing theoretical support for neural scaling laws lacks rigor and clarity, entangling the roles of information and optimization. In this work, we develop rigorous information-theoretic foundations for neural scaling laws. This allows us to characterize scaling laws for data generated by a two-layer neural network of infinite width. We observe that the optimal relation between data and model size is linear, up to logarithmic factors, corroborating large-scale empirical investigations. Concise yet general results of the kind we establish may bring clarity to this topic and inform future investigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jibang Wu, Siyu Chen, Mengdi Wang, Huazheng Wang, Haifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The agency problem emerges in today's large scale machine learning tasks, where the learners are unable to direct content creation or enforce data collection. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for aligning economic interests of different stakeholders in the online learning problems through contract design. The problem, termed \emph{contractual reinforcement learning}, naturally arises from the classic model of Markov decision processes, where a learning principal seeks to optimally influence the agent's action policy for their common interests through a set of payment rules contingent on the realization of next state. For the planning problem, we design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal contracts against the far-sighted agent. For the learning problem, we introduce a generic design of no-regret learning algorithms to untangle the challenges from robust design of contracts to the balance of exploration and exploitation, reducing the complexity analysis to the construction of efficient search algorithms. For several natural classes of problems, we design tailored search algorithms that provably achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We also present an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for the general problem that improves the existing analysis in online contract design with mild technical assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadezhda Chirkova, David Rau, Herv\'e D\'ejean, Thibault Formal, St\'ephane Clinchant, Vassilina Nikoulina</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution for incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) and improving LLM factuality, but is predominantly studied in English-only settings. In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works. Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages. Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities. The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval. We release the code for the resulting mRAG baseline pipeline at https://github.com/naver/bergen.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) provides solutions for Stokes equations relevant to ice sheet dynamics by employing finite element and fine mesh adaption. However, since its finite element method is compatible only with Central Processing Units (CPU), the ISSM has limits on further economizing computational time. Thus, by taking advantage of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), we design a graph convolutional network (GCN) as a fast emulator for ISSM. The GCN is trained and tested using the 20-year transient ISSM simulations in the Pine Island Glacier (PIG). The GCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.998, outperforming the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, GCN shows 34 times faster computational speed than the CPU-based ISSM modeling. The GPU-based GCN emulator allows us to predict how the PIG will change in the future under different melting rate scenarios with high fidelity and much faster computational time.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01489">Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunqiu Steven Xia, Yinlin Deng, Soren Dunn, Lingming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the automation of software development tasks, including code synthesis, program repair, and test generation. More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic two-phase process of localization followed by repair, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (27.33%) and lowest cost (\$0.34) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu\'isa Shimabucoro, Sebastian Ruder, Julia Kreutzer, Marzieh Fadaee, Sara Hooker</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic data raises new questions about how models generating the data can influence other large language models (LLMs) via distilled data. To start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of passive inheritance of model properties by systematically studying the consequences of synthetic data integration. We provide one of the most comprehensive studies to-date of how the source of synthetic data shapes models' internal biases, calibration and generations' textual attributes and preferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear "neutral". which invites the question whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good.
  Our findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the models towards the properties we want at test time by exploiting the data generation process? This would have historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of collecting data with a specific characteristic or objective in mind. However, improvement in the quality of synthetic data, as well as a shift towards general-purpose models designed to follow a diverse way of instructions, means this question is timely. We propose active inheritance as a term to describe intentionally constraining synthetic data according to a non-differentiable objective. We demonstrate how active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of models towards desirable non-differentiable attributes, e.g. high lexical diversity or low toxicity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training a set of small models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict their performance given their respective mixtures. With the fitted regression model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens of different mixtures to fit the regression model and find the optimal mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing only 10% of the compute budget. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance variations of up to 14.6%; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the complexity by considering all domains together.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayash Kapoor, Benedikt Stroebl, Zachary S. Siegel, Nitya Nadgir, Arvind Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents are an exciting new research direction, and agent development is driven by benchmarks. Our analysis of current agent benchmarks and evaluation practices reveals several shortcomings that hinder their usefulness in real-world applications. First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without attention to other metrics. As a result, SOTA agents are needlessly complex and costly, and the community has reached mistaken conclusions about the sources of accuracy gains. Our focus on cost in addition to accuracy motivates the new goal of jointly optimizing the two metrics. We design and implement one such optimization, showing its potential to greatly reduce cost while maintaining accuracy. Second, the benchmarking needs of model and downstream developers have been conflated, making it hard to identify which agent would be best suited for a particular application. Third, many agent benchmarks have inadequate holdout sets, and sometimes none at all. This has led to agents that are fragile because they take shortcuts and overfit to the benchmark in various ways. We prescribe a principled framework for avoiding overfitting. Finally, there is a lack of standardization in evaluation practices, leading to a pervasive lack of reproducibility. We hope that the steps we introduce for addressing these shortcomings will spur the development of agents that are useful in the real world and not just accurate on benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, they also raise concerns regarding self-cognition. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study to explore self-cognition in LLMs. Specifically, we first construct a pool of self-cognition instruction prompts to evaluate where an LLM exhibits self-cognition and four well-designed principles to quantify LLMs' self-cognition. Our study reveals that 4 of the 48 models on Chatbot Arena--specifically Command R, Claude3-Opus, Llama-3-70b-Instruct, and Reka-core--demonstrate some level of detectable self-cognition. We observe a positive correlation between model size, training data quality, and self-cognition level. Additionally, we also explore the utility and trustworthiness of LLM in the self-cognition state, revealing that the self-cognition state enhances some specific tasks such as creative writing and exaggeration. We believe that our work can serve as an inspiration for further research to study the self-cognition in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of open-set domain generalization (OSDG) involves recognizing novel classes within unseen domains, which becomes more challenging with multiple modalities as input. Existing works have only addressed unimodal OSDG within the meta-learning framework, without considering multimodal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to address Multimodal Open-Set Domain Generalization (MM-OSDG) for the first time, utilizing self-supervision. To this end, we introduce two innovative multimodal self-supervised pretext tasks: Masked Cross-modal Translation and Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles. These tasks facilitate the learning of multimodal representative features, thereby enhancing generalization and open-class detection capabilities. Additionally, we propose a novel entropy weighting mechanism to balance the loss across different modalities. Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle also the Multimodal Open-Set Domain Adaptation (MM-OSDA) problem, especially in scenarios where unlabeled data from the target domain is available. Extensive experiments conducted under MM-OSDG, MM-OSDA, and Multimodal Closed-Set DG settings on the EPIC-Kitchens and HAC datasets demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingliang Zhang, Wenda Chu, Julius Berner, Chenlin Meng, Anima Anandkumar, Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although great progress has been made in 3D visual grounding, current models still rely on explicit textual descriptions for grounding and lack the ability to reason human intentions from implicit instructions. We propose a new task called 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which provides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that require the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our approach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered by Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to obtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and fine-grained details from the 3D scenes. A chain-of-grounding mechanism is proposed to further boost the performance with interleaved reasoning and grounding steps during inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Lorraine</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been critical to the success of machine learning, updating a single set of parameters to minimize a single loss. A growing number of applications rely on a generalization of this, where we have a bilevel or nested optimization of which subsets of parameters update on different objectives nested inside each other. We focus on motivating examples of hyperparameter optimization and generative adversarial networks. However, naively applying classical methods often fails when we look at solving these nested problems on a large scale. In this thesis, we build tools for nested optimization that scale to deep learning setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Bai, Dongxia Wang, Tim Muller, Peng Cheng, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) is a well-known optimal decision rule for collective decision making, given the probability of sources to provide accurate information (trustworthiness). However, in reality, the trustworthiness is not a known quantity to the decision maker - they have to rely on an estimate called trust. A (machine learning) algorithm that computes trust is called unbiased when it has the property that it does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the trustworthiness. To formally analyse the uncertainty to the decision process, we introduce and analyse two important properties of such unbiased trust values: stability of correctness and stability of optimality. Stability of correctness means that the decision accuracy that the decision maker believes they achieved is equal to the actual accuracy. We prove stability of correctness holds. Stability of optimality means that the decisions made based on trust, are equally good as they would have been if they were based on trustworthiness. Stability of optimality does not hold. We analyse the difference between the two, and bounds thereon. We also present an overview of how sensitive decision correctness is to changes in trust and trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mithun Goutham, Meghna Menon, Sarah Garrow, Stephanie Stockar</p>
<p>Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem in Euclidean spaces, but it has never been extended to the non-Euclidean problem. This paper proposes an adaptation that uses multidimensional scaling to first project the points from a non-Euclidean space into a Euclidean equivalent space, thereby enabling the generation of a convex hull that initializes the algorithm. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, non-Euclidean spaces are created by adding separators to the Euclidean TSPLIB benchmark data-set, or by using the L1 norm as a metric. This adapted heuristic is demonstrated to outperform the commonly used Nearest Neighbor heuristic and Nearest Insertion heuristic in 88% and 99% of the cases studied, respectively. When compared with metaheuristic algorithms, the proposed heuristic's tour costs are lower than the solutions found by the genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm in 87% and 95% of the instances, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has boosted the achievement of remarkable results across numerous data analysis tasks, however, this is typically accompanied by a significant shortcoming in the exhibited transparency and trustworthiness of the developed systems. In order to address the latter challenge, the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) research field has emerged, which aims, among others, at estimating meaningful explanations regarding the employed model reasoning process. The current study focuses on systematically analyzing the recent advances in the area of Multimodal XAI (MXAI), which comprises methods that involve multiple modalities in the primary prediction and explanation tasks. In particular, the relevant AI-boosted prediction tasks and publicly available datasets used for learning/evaluating explanations in multimodal scenarios are initially described. Subsequently, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the MXAI methods of the literature is provided, taking into account the following key criteria: a) The number of the involved modalities (in the employed AI module), b) The processing stage at which explanations are generated, and c) The type of the adopted methodology (i.e. the actual mechanism and mathematical formalization) for producing explanations. Then, a thorough analysis of the metrics used for MXAI methods evaluation is performed. Finally, an extensive discussion regarding the current challenges and future research directions is provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yao Ko, Katsuyuki Suzuki, Kazuo Yonekura</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for discrete optimum design of truss structures utilizing Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with update process, the best reward, accelerating technique, and terminal condition. An improved MCTS formulation with multiple root nodes is developed in this study. Update process means that once a final solution is found, it is used as the initial solution for next search tree. The best reward is used in the backpropagation step. Accelerating technique is introduced by decreasing the width of search tree and reducing maximum number of iterations. The agent is trained to minimize the total structural weight under various constraints until the terminal condition is satisfied. Then, optimal solution is the minimum value of all solutions found by search trees. These numerical examples show that the agent can find optimal solution with low computational cost, stably produces an optimal design, and is suitable for practical engineering problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Liu, Hao Hu, Shenao Zhang, Hongyi Guo, Shuqi Ke, Boyi Liu, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In particular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call "reason for future, act for now" (\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon ("reason for future"). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory ("act for now"), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.
  The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory buffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an "in-context" manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of long-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret. Here, $T$ denotes the number of online interactions. In particular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the prior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction achieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it outperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloofar Mireshghallah, Hyunwoo Kim, Xuhui Zhou, Yulia Tsvetkov, Maarten Sap, Reza Shokri, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The interactive use of large language models (LLMs) in AI assistants (at work, home, etc.) introduces a new set of inference-time privacy risks: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose and with whom, within a given context. In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory of mind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Chen, Liqin Wang, Julie Hong, Jiaqi Jiang, Li Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Objectives: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) holds transformative potential to improve healthcare. Yet, addressing bias in AI, which risks worsening healthcare disparities, cannot be overlooked. This study reviews methods to detect and mitigate diverse forms of bias in AI models developed using EHR data. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE published between January 1, 2010, and Dec 17, 2023. The review identified key biases, outlined strategies for detecting and mitigating bias throughout the AI model development process, and analyzed metrics for bias assessment. Results: Of the 450 articles retrieved, 20 met our criteria, revealing six major bias types: algorithmic, confounding, implicit, measurement, selection, and temporal. The AI models were primarily developed for predictive tasks in healthcare settings. Four studies concentrated on the detection of implicit and algorithmic biases employing fairness metrics like statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive equity. Sixty proposed various strategies for mitigating biases, especially targeting implicit and selection biases. These strategies, evaluated through both performance (e.g., accuracy, AUROC) and fairness metrics, predominantly involved data collection and preprocessing techniques like resampling, reweighting, and transformation. Discussion: This review highlights the varied and evolving nature of strategies to address bias in EHR-based AI models, emphasizing the urgent needs for the establishment of standardized, generalizable, and interpretable methodologies to foster the creation of ethical AI systems that promote fairness and equity in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natasha Butt, Blazej Manczak, Auke Wiggers, Corrado Rainone, David W. Zhang, Micha\"el Defferrard, Taco Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the target program output given input) to the realized output produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha K\"ocher, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steph Buongiorno, Lawrence Jake Klinkert, Tanishq Chawla, Zixin Zhuang, Corey Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs). Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative. The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses. PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative. A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative. Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative. For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs. PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game. These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo. As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuro-symbolic systems (NeSy), which claim to combine the best of both learning and reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence, are missing a core property of reasoning systems: Declarativeness. The lack of declarativeness is caused by the functional nature of neural predicates inherited from neural networks. We propose and implement a general framework for fully declarative neural predicates, which hence extends to fully declarative NeSy frameworks. We first show that the declarative extension preserves the learning and reasoning capabilities while being able to answer arbitrary queries while only being trained on a single query type.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhan Huang, Qingning Shen, Yan Hu, Anningzhe Gao, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical modeling involves representing real-world phenomena, systems, or problems using mathematical expressions and equations to analyze, understand, and predict their behavior. Given that this process typically requires experienced experts, there is an interest in exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can undertake mathematical modeling to potentially decrease human labor. To evaluate of LLMs in mathematical modeling, we introduce a new benchmark, Mamo, that transcends traditional result-oriented assessments. Unlike conventional methods that primarily assess LLMs based on the accuracy of solutions to mathematical problems, our approach offers deeper insight into the modeling process itself. By focusing on the processes LLMs undertake rather than the correctness of their final solutions, Mamo pioneers a novel evaluation paradigm. This shift underscores the importance of understanding the inherent modeling capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of their problem-solving strategies. Our work marks a significant advancement in the field, suggesting a new direction for future research by emphasizing the evaluation of LLMs' modeling processes over the mere correctness of answers. This benchmark not only facilitates a better understanding of LLMs' mathematical modeling capabilities but also sets a new standard for evaluating their performance in complex problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a pioneering methodology for boosting large language models in the domain of protein representation learning. Our primary contribution lies in the refinement process for correlating the over-reliance on co-evolution knowledge, in a way that networks are trained to distill invaluable insights from negative samples, constituted by protein pairs sourced from disparate categories. By capitalizing on this novel approach, our technique steers the training of transformer-based models within the attention score space. This advanced strategy not only amplifies performance but also reflects the nuanced biological behaviors exhibited by proteins, offering aligned evidence with traditional biological mechanisms such as protein-protein interaction. We experimentally observed improved performance on various tasks over datasets, on top of several well-established large protein models. This innovative paradigm opens up promising horizons for further progress in the realms of protein research and computational biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayang Liang, Jinyang Lai, Yunlong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: How to improve the ability of scene representation is a key issue in vision-oriented decision-making applications, and current approaches usually learn task-relevant state representations within visual reinforcement learning to address this problem. While prior work typically introduces one-step behavioral similarity metrics with elements (e.g., rewards and actions) to extract task-relevant state information from observations, they often ignore the inherent dynamics relationships among the elements that are essential for learning accurate representations, which further impedes the discrimination of short-term similar task/behavior information in long-term dynamics transitions. To alleviate this problem, we propose an intrinsic dynamics-driven representation learning method with sequence models in visual reinforcement learning, namely DSR. Concretely, DSR optimizes the parameterized encoder by the state-transition dynamics of the underlying system, which prompts the latent encoding information to satisfy the state-transition process and then the state space and the noise space can be distinguished. In the implementation and to further improve the representation ability of DSR on encoding similar tasks, sequential elements' frequency domain and multi-step prediction are adopted for sequentially modeling the inherent dynamics. Finally, experimental results show that DSR has achieved significant performance improvements in the visual Distracting DMControl control tasks, especially with an average of 78.9\% over the backbone baseline. Further results indicate that it also achieves the best performances in real-world autonomous driving applications on the CARLA simulator. Moreover, qualitative analysis results validate that our method possesses the superior ability to learn generalizable scene representations on visual tasks.

<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specification gaming occurs when AI systems learn undesired behaviors that are highly rewarded due to misspecified training goals. Specification gaming can range from simple behaviors like sycophancy to sophisticated and pernicious behaviors like reward-tampering, where a model directly modifies its own reward mechanism. However, these more pernicious behaviors may be too complex to be discovered via exploration. In this paper, we study whether Large Language Model (LLM) assistants which find easily discovered forms of specification gaming will generalize to perform rarer and more blatant forms, up to and including reward-tampering. We construct a curriculum of increasingly sophisticated gameable environments and find that training on early-curriculum environments leads to more specification gaming on remaining environments. Strikingly, a small but non-negligible proportion of the time, LLM assistants trained on the full curriculum generalize zero-shot to directly rewriting their own reward function. Retraining an LLM not to game early-curriculum environments mitigates, but does not eliminate, reward-tampering in later environments. Moreover, adding harmlessness training to our gameable environments does not prevent reward-tampering. These results demonstrate that LLMs can generalize from common forms of specification gaming to more pernicious reward tampering and that such behavior may be nontrivial to remove.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Jiang, Fei Deng, Gautam Singh, Minseung Lee, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent State Space Models (SSMs) such as S4, S5, and Mamba have shown remarkable computational benefits in long-range temporal dependency modeling. However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric video understanding, 3D visual reasoning, and video prediction tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amelie Gyrard, Seyedali Mohammadi, Manas Gaur, Antonio Kung</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) give the UN a road map for development with Agenda 2030 as a target. SDG3 "Good Health and Well-Being" ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. Digital technologies can support SDG3. Burnout and even depression could be reduced by encouraging better preventive health. Due to the lack of patient knowledge and focus to take care of their health, it is necessary to help patients before it is too late. New trends such as positive psychology and mindfulness are highly encouraged in the USA. Digital Twin (DT) can help with the continuous monitoring of emotion using physiological signals (e.g., collected via wearables). Digital twins facilitate monitoring and provide constant health insight to improve quality of life and well-being with better personalization. Healthcare DT challenges are standardizing data formats, communication protocols, and data exchange mechanisms. To achieve those data integration and knowledge challenges, we designed the Mental Health Knowledge Graph (ontology and dataset) to boost mental health. The Knowledge Graph (KG) acquires knowledge from ontology-based mental health projects classified within the LOV4IoT ontology catalog (Emotion, Depression, and Mental Health). Furthermore, the KG is mapped to standards (e.g., ontologies) when possible. Standards from ETSI SmartM2M, ITU/WHO, ISO, W3C, NIST, and IEEE are relevant to mental health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichao Shen, Tianchen Zhu, Qingyun Sun, Shiqi Gao, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in evaluating policy trajectories within intricate game tasks due to the difficulty in designing comprehensive and precise reward functions. This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianfan Fu, Cao Xiao, Xinhao Li, Lucas M. Glass, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule optimization is a fundamental task for accelerating drug discovery, with the goal of generating new valid molecules that maximize multiple drug properties while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. Existing generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success, but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs' prediction and employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to 49.6% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate. The code repository (including readme file, data preprocessing and model construction, evaluation) is available https://github.com/futianfan/MIMOSA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyiran Li, Fangyu Liu, Nigel Collier, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is a key cross-lingual task, aiming to bridge the lexical gap between different languages. In this work, we propose a robust and effective two-stage contrastive learning framework for the BLI task. At Stage C1, we propose to refine standard cross-lingual linear maps between static word embeddings (WEs) via a contrastive learning objective; we also show how to integrate it into the self-learning procedure for even more refined cross-lingual maps. In Stage C2, we conduct BLI-oriented contrastive fine-tuning of mBERT, unlocking its word translation capability. We also show that static WEs induced from the `C2-tuned' mBERT complement static WEs from Stage C1. Comprehensive experiments on standard BLI datasets for diverse languages and different experimental setups demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework. While the BLI method from Stage C1 already yields substantial gains over all state-of-the-art BLI methods in our comparison, even stronger improvements are met with the full two-stage framework: e.g., we report gains for 112/112 BLI setups, spanning 28 language pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florent Chiaroni, Malik Boudiaf, Amar Mitiche, Ismail Ben Ayed</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore clustering the softmax predictions of deep neural networks and introduce a novel probabilistic clustering method, referred to as k-sBetas. In the general context of clustering discrete distributions, the existing methods focused on exploring distortion measures tailored to simplex data, such as the KL divergence, as alternatives to the standard Euclidean distance. We provide a general maximum a posteriori (MAP) perspective of clustering distributions, emphasizing that the statistical models underlying the existing distortion-based methods may not be descriptive enough. Instead, we optimize a mixed-variable objective measuring data conformity within each cluster to the introduced sBeta density function, whose parameters are constrained and estimated jointly with binary assignment variables. Our versatile formulation approximates various parametric densities for modeling simplex data and enables the control of the cluster-balance bias. This yields highly competitive performances for the unsupervised adjustment of black-box model predictions in various scenarios. Our code and comparisons with the existing simplex-clustering approaches and our introduced softmax-prediction benchmarks are publicly available: https://github.com/fchiaroni/Clustering_Softmax_Predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Longa, Steve Azzolin, Gabriele Santin, Giulia Cencetti, Pietro Li\`o, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: Following a fast initial breakthrough in graph based learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have reached a widespread application in many science and engineering fields, prompting the need for methods to understand their decision process.
  GNN explainers have started to emerge in recent years, with a multitude of methods both novel or adapted from other domains. To sort out this plethora of alternative approaches, several studies have benchmarked the performance of different explainers in terms of various explainability metrics. However, these earlier works make no attempts at providing insights into why different GNN architectures are more or less explainable, or which explainer should be preferred in a given setting.
  In this survey, we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests ten explainers on eight representative architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets. With our results we provide key insights on the choice and applicability of GNN explainers, we isolate key components that make them usable and successful and provide recommendations on how to avoid common interpretation pitfalls. We conclude by highlighting open questions and directions of possible future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Mei, Xubo Liu, Jianyuan Sun, Mark D. Plumbley, Wenwu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a cross-modal translation task for describing the content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple (e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangxi Wu, Qiuyang He, Jian Yu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the swift advancement of deep learning, state-of-the-art algorithms have been utilized in various social situations. Nonetheless, some algorithms have been discovered to exhibit biases and provide unequal results. The current debiasing methods face challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. In this work, we found that the backdoor attack can construct an artificial bias similar to the model bias derived in standard training. Considering the strong adjustability of backdoor triggers, we are motivated to mitigate the model bias by carefully designing reverse artificial bias created from backdoor attack. Based on this, we propose a backdoor debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation, which effectively reduces the model bias from original data and minimizes security risks from the backdoor attack. The proposed solution is validated on both image and structured datasets, showing promising results. This work advances the understanding of backdoor attacks and highlights its potential for beneficial applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung Hwan Heo, Seyedarmin Azizi, Arash Fayyazi, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: Token merging has emerged as a new paradigm that can accelerate the inference of Vision Transformers (ViTs) without any retraining or fine-tuning. To push the frontier of training-free acceleration in ViTs, we improve token merging by adding the perspectives of 1) activation outliers and 2) hierarchical representations. Through a careful analysis of the attention behavior in ViTs, we characterize a delayed onset of the convergent attention phenomenon, which makes token merging undesirable in the bottom blocks of ViTs. Moreover, we augment token merging with a hierarchical processing scheme to capture multi-scale redundancy between visual tokens. Combining these two insights, we build a unified inference framework called DSM: Delayed Spatial Merging. We extensively evaluate DSM on various ViT model scales (Tiny to Huge) and tasks (ImageNet-1k and transfer learning), achieving up to 1.8$\times$ FLOP reduction and 1.6$\times$ throughput speedup at a negligible loss while being two orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Or, Nimrod Segol, Areej Eweida, Maxim Freydin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to vehicle positioning that operates without reliance on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Traditional GNSS approaches are vulnerable to interference in certain environments, rendering them unreliable in situations such as urban canyons, under flyovers, or in low reception areas. This study proposes a vehicle positioning method based on learning the road signature from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. In our approach, the route is divided into segments, each with a distinct signature that the IMU can detect through the vibrations of a vehicle in response to subtle changes in the road surface. The study presents two different data-driven methods for learning the road segment from IMU measurements. One method is based on convolutional neural networks and the other on ensemble random forest applied to handcrafted features. Additionally, the authors present an algorithm to deduce the position of a vehicle in real-time using the learned road segment. The approach was applied in two positioning tasks: (i) a car along a 6[km] route in a dense urban area; (ii) an e-scooter on a 1[km] route that combined road and pavement surfaces. The mean error between the proposed method's position and the ground truth was approximately 50[m] for the car and 30[m] for the e-scooter. Compared to a solution based on time integration of the IMU measurements, the proposed approach has a mean error of more than 5 times better for e-scooters and 20 times better for cars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai A. Shaaban, Mariam Kashkash, Maryam Alghfeli, Adham Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in the field of deep learning is obtaining the optimal model hyperparameters. The search for optimal hyperparameters usually hinders the progress of solutions to real-world problems such as healthcare. Previous solutions have been proposed, but they can still get stuck in local optima. To overcome this hurdle, we propose OptBA to automatically fine-tune the hyperparameters of deep learning models by leveraging the Bees Algorithm, which is a recent promising swarm intelligence algorithm. In this paper, the optimization problem of OptBA is to maximize the accuracy in classifying ailments using medical text, where initial hyperparameters are iteratively adjusted by specific criteria. Experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy enhancement in accuracy with approximately 1.4%. This outcome highlights the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in addressing the critical issue of hyperparameter optimization and its potential impact on advancing solutions for healthcare.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deborah Morgan, Youmna Hashem, John Francis, Saba Esnaashari, Vincent J. Straub, Jonathan Bright</p>
<p>Abstract: This article explores how the 'rules in use' from Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) can be developed as a context analysis approach for AI. AI risk assessment frameworks increasingly highlight the need to understand existing contexts. However, these approaches do not frequently connect with established institutional analysis scholarship. We outline a novel direction illustrated through a high-level example to understand how clinical oversight is potentially impacted by AI. Much current thinking regarding oversight for AI revolves around the idea of decision makers being in-the-loop and, thus, having capacity to intervene to prevent harm. However, our analysis finds that oversight is complex, frequently made by teams of professionals and relies upon explanation to elicit information. Professional bodies and liability also function as institutions of polycentric oversight. These are all impacted by the challenge of oversight of AI systems. The approach outlined has potential utility as a policy tool of context analysis aligned with the 'Govern and Map' functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework; however, further empirical research is needed. Our analysis illustrates the benefit of existing institutional analysis approaches in foregrounding team structures within oversight and, thus, in conceptions of 'human in the loop'.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Phelps, Yvan I. Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigated the capability of the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM) to operationalize natural language descriptions of cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and self-interested behavior in two social dilemmas: the repeated Prisoners Dilemma and the one-shot Dictator Game. Using a within-subject experimental design, we used a prompt to describe the task environment using a similar protocol to that used in experimental psychology studies with human subjects. We tested our research question by manipulating the part of our prompt which was used to create a simulated persona with different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the resulting simulacras' level of cooperation in each social dilemma, taking into account the effect of different partner conditions for the repeated game. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can, to some extent, translate natural language descriptions of different cooperative stances into corresponding descriptions of appropriate task behaviour, particularly in the one-shot game. There is some evidence of behaviour resembling conditional reciprocity for the cooperative simulacra in the repeated game, and for the later version of the model there is evidence of altruistic behaviour. Our study has potential implications for using LLM chatbots in task environments that involve cooperation, e.g. using chatbots as mediators and facilitators in public-goods negotiations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiechen Chen, Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process time-series data via internal event-driven neural dynamics. The energy consumption of an SNN depends on the number of spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. Typically, decisions are produced after the entire input sequence has been processed. This results in latency and energy consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. However, as explored in recent work, SNNs can produce an early decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident'', adapting delay and energy consumption to the difficulty of each example. Existing techniques are based on heuristic measures of confidence that do not provide reliability guarantees, potentially exiting too early. In this paper, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping times. The approach, dubbed SpikeCP, leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP). It entails minimal complexity increase as compared to the underlying SNN, requiring only additional thresholding and counting operations at run time. SpikeCP is also extended to integrate a CP-aware training phase that targets delay performance. Variants of CP based on alternative confidence correction schemes, from Bonferroni to Simes, are explored, and extensive experiments are described using the MNIST-DVS data set, DVS128 Gesture dataset, and CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoung Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Pieter Abbeel, Younggyo Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: A promising technique for exploration is to maximize the entropy of visited state distribution, i.e., state entropy, by encouraging uniform coverage of visited state space. While it has been effective for an unsupervised setup, it tends to struggle in a supervised setup with a task reward, where an agent prefers to visit high-value states to exploit the task reward. Such a preference can cause an imbalance between the distributions of high-value states and low-value states, which biases exploration towards low-value state regions as a result of the state entropy increasing when the distribution becomes more uniform. This issue is exacerbated when high-value states are narrowly distributed within the state space, making it difficult for the agent to complete the tasks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration technique that maximizes the value-conditional state entropy, which separately estimates the state entropies that are conditioned on the value estimates of each state, then maximizes their average. By only considering the visited states with similar value estimates for computing the intrinsic bonus, our method prevents the distribution of low-value states from affecting exploration around high-value states, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the proposed alternative to the state entropy baseline significantly accelerates various reinforcement learning algorithms across a variety of tasks within MiniGrid, DeepMind Control Suite, and Meta-World benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Generative AI systems across modalities, ranging from text (including code), image, audio, and video, have broad social impacts, but there is no official standard for means of evaluating those impacts or for which impacts should be evaluated. In this paper, we present a guide that moves toward a standard approach in evaluating a base generative AI system for any modality in two overarching categories: what can be evaluated in a base system independent of context and what can be evaluated in a societal context. Importantly, this refers to base systems that have no predetermined application or deployment context, including a model itself, as well as system components, such as training data. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social impact: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to listed generative modalities and analyses of the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what can be evaluated in a broader societal context, each with its own subcategories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each subcategory includes recommendations for mitigating harm.</p>

We follow the strict separation of source training and target testing, but exploit the value of the unlabeled target data itself during inference. We make three contributions. First, we propose probabilistic pseudo-labeling of target samples to generalize the source-trained model to the target domain at test time. We formulate the generalization at test time as a variational inference problem, by modeling pseudo labels as distributions, to consider the uncertainty during generalization and alleviate the misleading signal of inaccurate pseudo labels. Second, we learn variational neighbor labels that incorporate the information of neighboring target samples to generate more robust pseudo labels. Third, to learn the ability to incorporate more representative target information and generate more precise and robust variational neighbor labels, we introduce a meta-generalization stage during training to simulate the generalization procedure. Experiments on seven widely-used datasets demonstrate the benefits, abilities, and effectiveness of our proposal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueying Ding, Yue Zhao, Leman Akoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) finds many applications with a rich literature of numerous techniques. Deep neural network based OD (DOD) has seen a recent surge of attention thanks to the many advances in deep learning. In this paper, we consider a critical-yet-understudied challenge with unsupervised DOD, that is, effective hyperparameter (HP) tuning/model selection. While several prior work report the sensitivity of OD models to HPs, it becomes ever so critical for the modern DOD models that exhibit a long list of HPs. We introduce HYPER for tuning DOD models, tackling two fundamental challenges: (1) validation without supervision (due to lack of labeled anomalies), and (2) efficient search of the HP/model space (due to exponential growth in the number of HPs). A key idea is to design and train a novel hypernetwork (HN) that maps HPs onto optimal weights of the main DOD model. In turn, HYPER capitalizes on a single HN that can dynamically generate weights for many DOD models (corresponding to varying HPs), which offers significant speed-up. In addition, it employs meta-learning on historical OD tasks with labels to train a proxy validation function, likewise trained with our proposed HN efficiently. Extensive experiments on 35 OD tasks show that HYPER achieves high performance against 8 baselines with significant efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Seichter, Benedict Stephan, S\"ohnke Benedikt Fischedick, Steffen M\"uller, Leonard Rabes, Horst-Michael Gross</p>
<p>Abstract: As the application scenarios of mobile robots are getting more complex and challenging, scene understanding becomes increasingly crucial. A mobile robot that is supposed to operate autonomously in indoor environments must have precise knowledge about what objects are present, where they are, what their spatial extent is, and how they can be reached; i.e., information about free space is also crucial. Panoptic mapping is a powerful instrument providing such information. However, building 3D panoptic maps with high spatial resolution is challenging on mobile robots, given their limited computing capabilities. In this paper, we propose PanopticNDT - an efficient and robust panoptic mapping approach based on occupancy normal distribution transform (NDT) mapping. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available datasets Hypersim and ScanNetV2. The results reveal that our approach can represent panoptic information at a higher level of detail than other state-of-the-art approaches while enabling real-time panoptic mapping on mobile robots. Finally, we prove the real-world applicability of PanopticNDT with qualitative results in a domestic application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Tellez, Jorge Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis between the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), two vital artificial intelligence algorithms, focusing on optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) parameters. These encompass the elliptic curve coefficients, prime number, generator point, group order, and cofactor. The study provides insights into which of the bio-inspired algorithms yields better optimization results for ECC configurations, examining performances under the same fitness function. This function incorporates methods to ensure robust ECC parameters, including assessing for singular or anomalous curves and applying Pollard's rho attack and Hasse's theorem for optimization precision. The optimized parameters generated by GA and PSO are tested in a simulated e-commerce environment, contrasting with well-known curves like secp256k1 during the transmission of order messages using Elliptic Curve-Diffie Hellman (ECDH) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Focusing on traditional computing in the pre-quantum era, this research highlights the efficacy of GA and PSO in ECC optimization, with implications for enhancing cybersecurity in third-party e-commerce integrations. We recommend the immediate consideration of these findings before quantum computing's widespread adoption.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of several novel deep neural network (DNN) architectures exhibiting ever-increasing performance across diverse tasks. Explaining the upward trend of their performance, however, remains difficult as different DNN architectures of comparable depth and width -- common factors associated with their expressive power -- may exhibit a drastically different performance even when trained on the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the non-linearity signature of DNN, the first theoretically sound solution for approximately measuring the non-linearity of deep neural networks. Built upon a score derived from closed-form optimal transport mappings, this signature provides a better understanding of the inner workings of a wide range of DNN architectures and learning paradigms, with a particular emphasis on the computer vision task. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical usefulness of the proposed non-linearity signature and its potential for long-reaching implications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma A. M. Stanley, Raissa Souza, Anthony Winder, Vedant Gulve, Kimberly Amador, Matthias Wilms, Nils D. Forkert</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical tasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between subgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of clinical AI that is robust and responsible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Schuster, Adam D. Lelkes, Haitian Sun, Jai Gupta, Jonathan Berant, William W. Cohen, Donald Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities. Yet, attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult, and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion. Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage. This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers. Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.
  To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Druart (LIA), Valentin Vielzeuf (LIA), Yannick Est\`eve (LIA)</p>
<p>Abstract: In Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, correctly updating the system's understanding of the user's requests (\textit{a.k.a} dialogue state tracking) is key to a smooth interaction. Traditionally, TOD systems perform this update in three steps: transcription of the user's utterance, semantic extraction of the key concepts, and contextualization with the previously identified concepts. Such cascade approaches suffer from cascading errors and separate optimization. End-to-End approaches have been proven helpful up to the turn-level semantic extraction step. This paper goes one step further and provides (1) a novel approach for completely neural spoken DST, (2) an in depth comparison with a state of the art cascade approach and (3) avenues towards better context propagation. Our study highlights that jointly-optimized approaches are also competitive for contextually dependent tasks, such as Dialogue State Tracking (DST), especially in audio native settings. Context propagation in DST systems could benefit from training procedures accounting for the previous' context inherent uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangqing Tu, Yuliang Sun, Yushi Bai, Jifan Yu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs), recent research has developed watermarking algorithms, which restrict the generation process to leave an invisible trace for watermark detection. Due to the two-stage nature of the task, most studies evaluate the generation and detection separately, thereby presenting a challenge in unbiased, thorough, and applicable evaluations. In this paper, we introduce WaterBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for LLM watermarks, in which we design three crucial factors: (1) For benchmarking procedure, to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, we first adjust each watermarking method's hyper-parameter to reach the same watermarking strength, then jointly evaluate their generation and detection performance. (2) For task selection, we diversify the input and output length to form a five-category taxonomy, covering $9$ tasks. (3) For evaluation metric, we adopt the GPT4-Judge for automatically evaluating the decline of instruction-following abilities after watermarking. We evaluate $4$ open-source watermarks on $2$ LLMs under $2$ watermarking strengths and observe the common struggles for current methods on maintaining the generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Shuo Xing, Shizhe Diao, Wenhe Sun, Xiang Liu, Kashun Shum, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunji Lee, Sejune Joo, Chaeeun Kim, Joel Jang, Doyoung Kim, Kyoung-Woon On, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce issues like hallucinations and lack of control in Large Language Models (LLMs), a common method is to generate responses by grounding on external contexts given as input, known as knowledge-augmented models. However, previous research often narrowly defines "grounding" as just having the correct answer, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To overcome this, we propose a stricter definition of grounding: a model is truly grounded if it (1) fully utilizes the necessary knowledge from the provided context, and (2) stays within the limits of that knowledge. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to evaluate model capability under the definition. We perform experiments across 25 LLMs of different sizes and training methods and provide insights into factors that influence grounding performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more reliable and controllable LLM applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13580">$\sigma$-PCA: a building block for neural learning of identifiable linear transformations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fahdi Kanavati, Lucy Katsnith, Masayuki Tsuneki</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear principal component analysis (PCA) learns (semi-)orthogonal transformations by orienting the axes to maximize variance. Consequently, it can only identify orthogonal axes whose variances are clearly distinct, but it cannot identify the subsets of axes whose variances are roughly equal. It cannot eliminate the subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to disentangle components with equal variances (eigenvalues), resulting, in each eigen subspace, in randomly rotated axes. In this paper, we propose $\sigma$-PCA, a method that (1) formulates a unified model for linear and nonlinear PCA, the latter being a special case of linear independent component analysis (ICA), and (2) introduces a missing piece into nonlinear PCA that allows it to eliminate, from the canonical linear PCA solution, the subspace rotational indeterminacy -- without whitening the inputs. Whitening, a preprocessing step which converts the inputs into unit-variance inputs, has generally been a prerequisite step for linear ICA methods, which meant that conventional nonlinear PCA could not necessarily preserve the orthogonality of the overall transformation, could not directly reduce dimensionality, and could not intrinsically order by variances. We offer insights on the relationship between linear PCA, nonlinear PCA, and linear ICA -- three methods with autoencoder formulations for learning special linear transformations from data, transformations that are (semi-)orthogonal for PCA, and arbitrary unit-variance for ICA. As part of our formulation, nonlinear PCA can be seen as a method that maximizes both variance and statistical independence, lying in the middle between linear PCA and linear ICA, serving as a building block for learning linear transformations that are identifiable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaran Chen, Wenbo Cui, Yuanwen Chen, Mining Tan, Xinyao Zhang, Dongbin Zhao, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Tao Meng, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The age estimation task aims to predict the age of an individual by analyzing facial features in an image. The development of age estimation can improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age verification and secure access control, etc.). In recent years, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has been widely used in various multimodal tasks and has made some progress in the field of age estimation. However, existing CLIP-based age estimation methods require high memory usage (quadratic complexity) when globally modeling images, and lack an error feedback mechanism to prompt the model about the quality of age prediction results. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel CLIP-driven Image-Language Fusion for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation (CILF-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image features and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly semantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new Transformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and spatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information. Compared with the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, the proposed Fourierformer is of linear log complexity. To further narrow the semantic gap between image and text features, we utilize an efficient contrastive multimodal learning module that supervises the multimodal fusion process of FourierFormer through contrastive loss for image-text matching, thereby improving the interaction effect between different modalities. Finally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error feedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, CILF-CIAE has achieved better age prediction results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishfaq Aziz, Elahe Soltanaghai, Adam Watts, Mohamad Alipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate estimation of sub-surface properties such as moisture content and depth of soil and vegetation layers is crucial for applications spanning sub-surface condition monitoring, precision agriculture, and effective wildfire risk assessment. Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of its material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The depth of the surface layer could also be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning is central to complex human activities, such as thinking, debating, and planning; it is also a central component of many AI systems as well. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which encoder-only transformer language models (LMs) can reason according to logical rules. We ask whether those LMs can deduce theorems in propositional calculus and first-order logic; if their relative success in these problems reflects general logical capabilities; and which layers contribute the most to the task. First, we show for several encoder-only LMs that they can be trained, to a reasonable degree, to determine logical validity on various datasets. Next, by cross-probing fine-tuned models on these datasets, we show that LMs have difficulty in transferring their putative logical reasoning ability, which suggests that they may have learned dataset-specific features, instead of a general capability. Finally, we conduct a layerwise probing experiment, which shows that the hypothesis classification task is mostly solved through higher layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nabeel Seedat, Nicolas Huynh, Boris van Breugel, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet crucial problem. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce CLLM, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. However, not all the data generated by LLMs will improve downstream utility, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation mechanism, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of CLLM in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. Additionally, we provide insights into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongkun Liu, Zheng Chen, Mengqi Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a self-supervised position debiasing (SOD) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. SOD leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose an objective alignment (OAM) module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that SOD consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, SOD achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods and datasets on https://github.com/LZKSKY/SOD.</p>

Recent studies show that representations that preserve temporally abstract environment dynamics are successful in solving difficult problems and provide theoretical guarantees for optimality. These methods however cannot scale to tasks where environment dynamics increase in complexity i.e. the temporally abstract transition relations depend on larger number of variables. On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge.
  In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer HRL algorithm that introduces, at different levels of the hierarchy, both a spatial and a temporal goal abstraction. We provide a theoretical study of the regret bounds of the learned policies. We evaluate the approach on complex continuous control tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatial and temporal abstractions learned by this approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Chao, Jiaxuan Zhao, Licheng Jiao, Lingling Li, Fang Liu, Shuyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities for generating creative natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper illustrates the parallels between LLMs and EAs, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. By examining these parallels, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research, with a specific focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. Drawing from these insights, valuable future directions are presented for advancing the integration of LLMs and EAs, while highlighting key challenges along the way. These parallels not only reveal the evolution mechanism behind LLMs but also facilitate the development of evolved artificial agents that approach or surpass biological organisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhimanyu Hans, Avi Schwarzschild, Valeriia Cherepanova, Hamid Kazemi, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxu Liu, Jian Lou, Li Xiong, Jinfei Liu, Xiaofeng Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhanced by differential privacy has emerged as a popular approach to better safeguard the privacy of client-side data by protecting clients' contributions during the training process. Existing solutions typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a novel framework named \textit{rPDP-FL}, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme with both uniform client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to accommodate varying privacy requirements.
  A critical and non-trivial problem is how to determine the ideal per-record sampling probability $q$ given the personalized privacy budget $\varepsilon$. We introduce a versatile solution named \textit{Simulation-CurveFitting}, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the nonlinear correlation between $q$ and $\varepsilon$ and derive an elegant mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our solution can provide significant performance gains over the baselines that do not consider personalized privacy preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets can be naturally represented as graphs, spanning a wide range of domains. However, the increasing complexity and size of graph datasets present significant challenges for analysis and computation. In response, graph reduction, or graph summarization, has gained prominence for simplifying large graphs while preserving essential properties. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of graph reduction methods, including graph sparsification, graph coarsening, and graph condensation. Specifically, we establish a unified definition for these methods and introduce a hierarchical taxonomy to categorize the challenges they address. Our survey then systematically reviews the technical details of these methods and emphasizes their practical applications across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we outline critical research directions to ensure the continued effectiveness of graph reduction techniques, as well as provide a comprehensive paper list at \url{https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-graph-reduction}. We hope this survey will bridge literature gaps and propel the advancement of this promising field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Wei, Kaixuan Huang, Yangsibo Huang, Tinghao Xie, Xiangyu Qi, Mengzhou Xia, Prateek Mittal, Mengdi Wang, Peter Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of generating plans for given natural language planning task requests. On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do not perform well on planning. On the other hand, classical planning tools excel at planning tasks but require input in a structured language such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Doostmohammadi, Oskar Holmstr\"om, Marco Kuhlmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual transfer. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</p>

Concurrently, adaptive learning, a concept that has gained substantial interest in the educational sphere, has proven its efficacy in enhancing students' learning efficiency. In this position paper, we aim to shed light on the intersectional studies of these two methods, which combine generative AI with adaptive learning concepts. By presenting discussions about the benefits, challenges, and potentials in this field, we argue that this union will contribute significantly to the development of the next-stage learning format in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu He, Chieh-Yang Huang, Chien-Kuang Cornelia Ding, Shaurya Rohatgi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies indicated GPT-4 outperforms online crowd workers in data labeling accuracy, notably workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). However, these studies were criticized for deviating from standard crowdsourcing practices and emphasizing individual workers' performances over the whole data-annotation process. This paper compared GPT-4 and an ethical and well-executed MTurk pipeline, with 415 workers labeling 3,177 sentence segments from 200 scholarly articles using the CODA-19 scheme. Two worker interfaces yielded 127,080 labels, which were then used to infer the final labels through eight label-aggregation algorithms. Our evaluation showed that despite best practices, MTurk pipeline's highest accuracy was 81.5%, whereas GPT-4 achieved 83.6%. Interestingly, when combining GPT-4's labels with crowd labels collected via an advanced worker interface for aggregation, 2 out of the 8 algorithms achieved an even higher accuracy (87.5%, 87.0%). Further analysis suggested that, when the crowd's and GPT-4's labeling strengths are complementary, aggregating them could increase labeling accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Wang, Jianghao Lin, Bo Chen, Yang Yang, Ruiming Tang, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) give rise to a promising research direction, i.e., leveraging LLMs as recommenders (LLMRec). The efficacy of LLMRec arises from the open-world knowledge and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. LLMRec acquires the recommendation capabilities through instruction tuning based on user interaction data. However, in order to protect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to intentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as recommendation unlearning. In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses new challenges for LLMRec in terms of \textit{inefficiency} and \textit{ineffectiveness}. Existing unlearning methods require updating billions of parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming. Besides, they always impact the model utility during the unlearning process. To this end, we propose \textbf{E2URec}, the first \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{U}nlearning method for LLM\underline{Rec}. Our proposed E2URec enhances the unlearning efficiency by updating only a few additional LoRA parameters, and improves the unlearning effectiveness by employing a teacher-student framework, where we maintain multiple teacher networks to guide the unlearning process. Extensive experiments show that E2URec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets. Specifically, E2URec can efficiently forget specific data without affecting recommendation performance. The source code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/E2URec}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Alfred Hero, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively 'unlearning' data points after training. This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies. Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Ehsan Farahbakhsh, Joseph Awange, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised machine learning methods for geological mapping via remote sensing face limitations due to the scarcity of accurately labelled training data that can be addressed by unsupervised learning, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. Dimensionality reduction methods have the potential to play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of geological maps. Although conventional dimensionality reduction methods may struggle with nonlinear data, unsupervised deep learning models such as autoencoders can model non-linear relationships. Stacked autoencoders feature multiple interconnected layers to capture hierarchical data representations useful for remote sensing data. This study presents an unsupervised machine learning-based framework for processing remote sensing data using stacked autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering for mapping geological units. We use Landsat 8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2 datasets to evaluate the framework for geological mapping of the Mutawintji region in Western New South Wales, Australia. We also compare stacked autoencoders with principal component analysis and canonical autoencoders. Our results reveal that the framework produces accurate and interpretable geological maps, efficiently discriminating rock units. We find that the accuracy of stacked autoencoders ranges from 86.6 % to 90 %, depending on the remote sensing data type, which is superior to their counterparts. We also find that the generated maps align with prior geological knowledge of the study area while providing novel insights into geological structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Ghafouri, Jose Such, Guillermo Suarez-Tangil</p>
<p>Abstract: The online trend of the manosphere and feminist discourse on social networks requires a holistic measure of the level of sexism in an online community. This indicator is important for policymakers and moderators of online communities (e.g., subreddits) and computational social scientists, either to revise moderation strategies based on the degree of sexism or to match and compare the temporal sexism across different platforms and communities with real-time events and infer social scientific insights.
  In this paper, we build a model that can provide a comparable holistic indicator of toxicity targeted toward male and female identity and male and female individuals. Despite previous supervised NLP methods that require annotation of toxic comments at the target level (e.g. annotating comments that are specifically toxic toward women) to detect targeted toxic comments, our indicator uses supervised NLP to detect the presence of toxicity and unsupervised word embedding association test to detect the target automatically.
  We apply our model to gender discourse communities (e.g., r/TheRedPill, r/MGTOW, r/FemaleDatingStrategy) to detect the level of toxicity toward genders (i.e., sexism). Our results show that our framework accurately and consistently (93% correlation) measures the level of sexism in a community. We finally discuss how our framework can be generalized in the future to measure qualities other than toxicity (e.g. sentiment, humor) toward general-purpose targets and turn into an indicator of different sorts of polarizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhigen Zhao, Shuo Cheng, Yan Ding, Ziyi Zhou, Shiqi Zhang, Danfei Xu, Ye Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks. Optimization-based TAMP focuses on hybrid optimization approaches that define goal conditions via objective functions and are capable of handling open-ended goals, robotic dynamics, and physical interaction between the robot and the environment. Therefore, optimization-based TAMP is particularly suited to solve highly complex, contact-rich locomotion and manipulation problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review on optimization-based TAMP, covering (i) planning domain representations, including action description languages and temporal logic, (ii) individual solution strategies for components of TAMP, including AI planning and trajectory optimization (TO), and (iii) the dynamic interplay between logic-based task planning and model-based TO. A particular focus of this survey is to highlight the algorithm structures to efficiently solve TAMP, especially hierarchical and distributed approaches. Additionally, the survey emphasizes the synergy between the classical methods and contemporary learning-based innovations such as large language models. Furthermore, the future research directions for TAMP is discussed in this survey, highlighting both algorithmic and application-specific challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models, such as the GPT family, use a fixed order, usually left-to-right, to generate sequences. However, this is not a necessity. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show that by simply adding a positional encoding for the output, this order can be modulated on-the-fly per-sample which offers key advantageous properties. It allows for the sampling of and conditioning on arbitrary subsets of tokens, and it also allows sampling in one shot multiple tokens dynamically according to a rejection strategy, leading to a sub-linear number of model evaluations. We evaluate our method across various domains, including language modeling, path-solving, and aircraft vertical rate prediction, decreasing the number of steps required for generation by an order of magnitude.</p>

An adaptive attack is one where the attacker is aware of the defenses and adapts their strategy accordingly. Our proposed method leverages adversarial training to reinforce the ability to detect attacks, without compromising clean accuracy. During the training phase, we integrate into the dataset adversarial examples, which were optimized to fool both the classifier and the adversarial detector, enabling the adversarial detector to learn and adapt to potential attack scenarios. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves a detector's ability to accurately identify adaptive adversarial attacks -- without sacrificing clean accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhou Shi, Zihao Xu, Hengyi Wang, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Zifeng Wang, Sayna Ebrahimi, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salvador Robles Herrera, Verya Monjezi, Vladik Kreinovich, Ashutosh Trivedi, Saeid Tizpaz-Niari</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships between hyperparameters of machine learning and fairness. Data-driven solutions are increasingly used in critical socio-technical applications where ensuring fairness is important. Rather than explicitly encoding decision logic via control and data structures, the ML developers provide input data, perform some pre-processing, choose ML algorithms, and tune hyperparameters (HPs) to infer a program that encodes the decision logic. Prior works report that the selection of HPs can significantly influence fairness. However, tuning HPs to find an ideal trade-off between accuracy, precision, and fairness has remained an expensive and tedious task. Can we predict fairness of HP configuration for a given dataset? Are the predictions robust to distribution shifts?
  We focus on group fairness notions and investigate the HP space of 5 training algorithms. We first find that tree regressors and XGBoots significantly outperformed deep neural networks and support vector machines in accurately predicting the fairness of HPs. When predicting the fairness of ML hyperparameters under temporal distribution shift, the tree regressors outperforms the other algorithms with reasonable accuracy. However, the precision depends on the ML training algorithm, dataset, and protected attributes. For example, the tree regressor model was robust for training data shift from 2014 to 2018 on logistic regression and discriminant analysis HPs with sex as the protected attribute; but not for race and other training algorithms. Our method provides a sound framework to efficiently perform fine-tuning of ML training algorithms and understand the relationships between HPs and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Coquelin, Katherina Fl\"ugel, Marie Weiel, Nicholas Kiefer, Muhammed \"Oz, Charlotte Debus, Achim Streit, Markus G\"otz</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication bottlenecks severely hinder the scalability of distributed neural network training, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. We introduce AB-training, a novel data-parallel method that leverages low-rank representations and independent training groups to significantly reduce communication overhead. Our experiments demonstrate an average reduction in network traffic of approximately 70.31\% across various scaling scenarios, increasing the training potential of communication-constrained systems and accelerating convergence at scale. AB-training also exhibits a pronounced regularization effect at smaller scales, leading to improved generalization while maintaining or even reducing training time. We achieve a remarkable 44.14 : 1 compression ratio on VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10 with minimal accuracy loss, and outperform traditional data parallel training by 1.55\% on ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet-2012. While AB-training is promising, our findings also reveal that large batch effects persist even in low-rank regimes, underscoring the need for further research into optimized update mechanisms for massively distributed training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Zhang, Aishan Liu, Tianyuan Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous driving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited effectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to consider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives (e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a dynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes in real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by changing driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed of shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by various forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling adaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To mitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning framework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental conditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse environmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the initialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly used LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness of our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15% on average in Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya Prasad, Kevin Lin, Jimmy Wu, Linqi Zhou, Jeannette Bohg</p>
<p>Abstract: Many robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators or quadrotors, cannot be equipped with high-end GPUs due to space, weight, and power constraints. These constraints prevent these systems from leveraging recent developments in visuomotor policy architectures that require high-end GPUs to achieve fast policy inference. In this paper, we propose Consistency Policy, a faster and similarly powerful alternative to Diffusion Policy for learning visuomotor robot control. By virtue of its fast inference speed, Consistency Policy can enable low latency decision making in resource-constrained robotic setups. A Consistency Policy is distilled from a pretrained Diffusion Policy by enforcing self-consistency along the Diffusion Policy's learned trajectories. We compare Consistency Policy with Diffusion Policy and other related speed-up methods across 6 simulation tasks as well as three real-world tasks where we demonstrate inference on a laptop GPU. For all these tasks, Consistency Policy speeds up inference by an order of magnitude compared to the fastest alternative method and maintains competitive success rates. We also show that the Conistency Policy training procedure is robust to the pretrained Diffusion Policy's quality, a useful result that helps practioners avoid extensive testing of the pretrained model. Key design decisions that enabled this performance are the choice of consistency objective, reduced initial sample variance, and the choice of preset chaining steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Chen, Yichen Li, Zikai Xiao, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing debiasing methods inevitably make unreasonable or undesired predictions as they are designated and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual facts, resulting in modified existing knowledge. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark BiasKE leveraging existing and additional constructed datasets, which systematically assesses debiasing performance by complementary metrics on fairness, specificity, and generalization. Meanwhile, we propose a novel debiasing method, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables editable fairness through fine-grained calibration on individual biased knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with remarkable debiasing performance while not hampering overall model capability for knowledge preservation, highlighting the prospect of fine-grained debiasing strategies for editable fairness in LLMs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11109">Watermarking Language Models for Many Adaptive Users</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aloni Cohen, Alexander Hoover, Gabe Schoenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: We study watermarking schemes for language models with provable guarantees. As we show, prior works offer no robustness guarantees against adaptive prompting: when a user queries a language model more than once, as even benign users do. And with just a single exception (Christ and Gunn, 2024), prior works are restricted to zero-bit watermarking: machine-generated text can be detected as such, but no additional information can be extracted from the watermark. Unfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated text may not prevent future abuses.
  We introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text to individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of adaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from undetectable, adaptively robust, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that the undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir (2024) is adaptively robust). Importantly, our scheme provides both zero-bit and multi-user assurances at the same time. It detects shorter snippets just as well as the original scheme, and traces longer excerpts to individuals.
  The main technical component is a construction of message-embedding watermarks from zero-bit watermarks. Ours is the first generic reduction between watermarking schemes for language models. A challenge for such reductions is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness -- that marked text is detectable even after edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction called AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable whenever the edited text "approximates enough blocks" of model-generated output.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11464">Efficient Prompt Tuning by Multi-Space Projection and Prompt Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Lan, Enneng Yang, Yuting Liu, Guibing Guo, Linying Jiang, Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning is a promising method to fine-tune a pre-trained language model without retraining its large-scale parameters. Instead, it attaches a soft prompt to the input text, whereby downstream tasks can be well adapted by merely learning the embeddings of prompt tokens. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two challenges: (i) they are hard to balance accuracy and efficiency. A longer (shorter) soft prompt generally leads to a better(worse) accuracy but at the cost of more (less) training time. (ii)The performance may not be consistent when adapting to different downstream tasks. We attribute it to the same embedding space but responsible for different requirements of downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Prompt Tuning method (EPT) by multi-space projection and prompt fusion. Specifically, it decomposes a given soft prompt into a shorter prompt and two low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the training time. Accuracy is also enhanced by leveraging low-rank matrices and the short prompt as additional knowledge sources to enrich the semantics of the original short prompt. In addition, we project the soft prompt into multiple subspaces to improve the performance consistency, and then adaptively learn the combination weights of different spaces through a gating network. Experiments on 13 natural language processing downstream tasks show that our method significantly and consistently outperforms 11 comparison methods with the relative percentage of improvements up to 12.9%, and training time decreased by 14%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin-Chun Li, Jin-Lin Tang, Bo Zhang, Lan Li, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12502">EntropyStop: Unsupervised Deep Outlier Detection with Loss Entropy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Huang, Yuang Zhang, Liping Wang, Fan Zhang, Xuemin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is an important data mining task. With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 2\% of training time. Lastly, our proposed metric and early-stopping approach are evaluated on other deep OD models, exhibiting their broad potential applicability.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13300">FAITH: Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons for Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Li, Maowei Jiang, Kai Wang, Kaiduo Feng, Quangao Liu, Yue Sun, Xiufang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as industrial equipment maintenance, meteorology, energy consumption, traffic flow and financial investment. However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in many fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its effectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15052">Revisiting MoE and Dense Speed-Accuracy Comparisons for LLM Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhi Du, Tom Gunter, Xiang Kong, Mark Lee, Zirui Wang, Aonan Zhang, Nan Du, Ruoming Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enjoys performance gain by increasing model capacity while keeping computation cost constant. When comparing MoE to dense models, prior work typically adopt the following setting: 1) use FLOPs or activated parameters as a measure of model complexity; 2) train all models to the same number of tokens. We argue that this setting favors MoE as FLOPs and activated parameters do not accurately measure the communication overhead in sparse layers, leading to a larger actual training budget for MoE. In this work, we revisit the settings by adopting step time as a more accurate measure of model complexity, and by determining the total compute budget under the Chinchilla compute-optimal settings. To efficiently run MoE on modern accelerators, we adopt a 3D sharding method that keeps the dense-to-MoE step time increase within a healthy range. We evaluate MoE and dense LLMs on a set of nine 0-shot and two 1-shot English tasks, as well as MMLU 5-shot and GSM8K 8-shot across three model scales at 6.4B, 12.6B, and 29.6B. Experimental results show that even under these settings, MoE consistently outperform dense LLMs on the speed-accuracy trade-off curve with meaningful gaps. Our full model implementation and sharding strategy has been released at~\url{https://github.com/apple/axlearn}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuhao Wang, Zhiyong Chen, Lepeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that updates value estimates for states or state-action pairs using a TD target. This target represents an improved estimate of the true value by incorporating both immediate rewards and the estimated value of subsequent states. Traditionally, TD learning relies on the value of a single subsequent state. We propose an enhanced multi-state TD (MSTD) target that utilizes the estimated values of multiple subsequent states. Building on this new MSTD concept, we develop complete actor-critic algorithms that include management of replay buffers in two modes, and integrate with deep deterministic policy optimization (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that algorithms employing the MSTD target significantly improve learning performance compared to traditional methods.The code is provided on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghong Li, Shan Qu, Xiuzhuang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing depression prediction methods based on deep learning show promise, their practical application is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness, as these deep models are often deployed as \textit{black box} models, leaving us uncertain about the confidence of the model predictions. For high-risk clinical applications like depression prediction, uncertainty quantification is essential in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce conformal depression prediction (CDP), a depression prediction method with uncertainty quantification based on conformal prediction (CP), giving valid confidence intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees for the model predictions. CDP is a plug-and-play module that requires neither model retraining nor an assumption about the depression data distribution. As CDP provides only an average coverage guarantee across all inputs rather than per-input performance guarantee, we further propose CDP-ACC, an improved conformal prediction with approximate conditional coverage. CDP-ACC firstly estimates the prediction distribution through neighborhood relaxation, and then introduces a conformal score function by constructing nested sequences, so as to provide a tighter prediction interval for each specific input. We empirically demonstrate the application of CDP in uncertainty-aware depression prediction, as well as the effectiveness and superiority of CDP-ACC on the AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 datasets.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00592">Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework Based on Dynamic Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitri P. Bertsekas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This framework centers around two algorithms, which are designed largely independently of each other and operate in synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We call them the off-line training and the on-line play algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17], [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s) TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95], [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
  Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control settings that involve changing system parameters, and the insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds implied by Newton's method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Masoud Rahmani, Amir Haider, Mohammad Adeli, Olfa Mzoughi, Entesar Gemeay, Mokhtar Mohammadi, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Parisa Khoshvaght, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in detecting abnormal heart sounds using two classification strategies: a single classifier and an ensemble classifier approach. Heart sounds were first pre-processed to remove noise and then segmented into S1, systole, S2, and diastole intervals, with thirteen MFCCs estimated from each segment, yielding 52 MFCCs per beat. Finally, MFCCs were used for heart sound classification. For that purpose, in the single classifier strategy, the MFCCs from nine consecutive beats were averaged to classify heart sounds by a single classifier (either a support vector machine (SVM), the k nearest neighbors (kNN), or a decision tree (DT)). Conversely, the ensemble classifier strategy employed nine classifiers (either nine SVMs, nine kNN classifiers, or nine DTs) to individually assess beats as normal or abnormal, with the overall classification based on the majority vote. Both methods were tested on a publicly available phonocardiogram database. The heart sound classification accuracy was 91.95% for the SVM, 91.9% for the kNN, and 87.33% for the DT in the single classifier strategy. Also, the accuracy was 93.59% for the SVM, 91.84% for the kNN, and 92.22% for the DT in the ensemble classifier strategy. Overall, the results demonstrated that the ensemble classifier strategy improved the accuracies of the DT and the SVM by 4.89% and 1.64%, establishing MFCCs as more effective than other features, including time, time-frequency, and statistical features, evaluated in similar studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianrong Guo, Saiveth Hernandez-Hernandez, Pedro J Ballester</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual Screening (VS) of vast compound libraries guided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is a highly productive approach to early drug discovery. Data splitting is crucial for better benchmarking of such AI models. Traditional random data splits produce similar molecules between training and test sets, conflicting with the reality of VS libraries which mostly contain structurally distinct compounds. Scaffold split, grouping molecules by shared core structure, is widely considered to reflect this real-world scenario. However, here we show that the scaffold split also overestimates VS performance. The reason is that molecules with different chemical scaffolds are often similar, which hence introduces unrealistically high similarities between training molecules and test molecules following a scaffold split. Our study examined three representative AI models on 60 NCI-60 datasets, each with approximately 30,000 to 50,000 molecules tested on a different cancer cell line. Each dataset was split with three methods: scaffold, Butina clustering and the more accurate Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering. Regardless of the model, model performance is much worse with UMAP splits from the results of the 2100 models trained and evaluated for each algorithm and split. These robust results demonstrate the need for more realistic data splits to tune, compare, and select models for VS. For the same reason, avoiding the scaffold split is also recommended for other molecular property prediction problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junru Zhang, Lang Feng, Zhidan Liu, Yuhan Wu, Yang He, Yabo Dong, Duanqing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing domain generalization (DG) methods for cross-person generalization tasks often face challenges in capturing intra- and inter-domain style diversity, resulting in domain gaps with the target domain. In this study, we explore a novel perspective to tackle this problem, a process conceptualized as domain padding. This proposal aims to enrich the domain diversity by synthesizing intra- and inter-domain style data while maintaining robustness to class labels. We instantiate this concept using a conditional diffusion model and introduce a style-fused sampling strategy to enhance data generation diversity. In contrast to traditional condition-guided sampling, our style-fused sampling strategy allows for the flexible use of one or more random styles to guide data synthesis. This feature presents a notable advancement: it allows for the maximum utilization of possible permutations and combinations among existing styles to generate a broad spectrum of new style instances. Empirical evaluations on a broad range of datasets demonstrate that our generated data achieves remarkable diversity within the domain space. Both intra- and inter-domain generated data have proven to be significant and valuable, contributing to varying degrees of performance enhancements. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods in all human activity recognition tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image classification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance trade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed decision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Dugan, Donato Manuel Jimenez Beneto, Charlotte Loh, Zhuo Chen, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. To achieve accurate calculations, language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations. However, this approach compromises speed and security and, if finetuning is involved, risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in \textit{a single autoregressive step}, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of an LLM to control a symbolic architecture which performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 8B Instruct with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o and on par with GPT 4o using a code interpreter. OccamLlama also outperforms GPT 4o both with and without a code interpreter on mathematical problem solving benchmarks involving challenging arithmetic, thus enabling small LLMs to match the arithmetic performance of even much larger models. We will make our code public shortly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Sun, Rong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE) assesses translation reliability without reference texts. This study introduces "textual similarity" as a new metric for QE, using sentence transformers and cosine similarity to measure semantic closeness. Analyzing data from the MLQE-PE dataset, we found that textual similarity exhibits stronger correlations with human scores than traditional metrics (hter, model evaluation, sentence probability etc.). Employing GAMMs as a statistical tool, we demonstrated that textual similarity consistently outperforms other metrics across multiple language pairs in predicting human scores. We also found that "hter" actually failed to predict human scores in QE. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of textual similarity as a robust QE metric, recommending its integration with other metrics into QE frameworks and MT system training for improved accuracy and usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guopeng Lin, Weili Han, Wenqiang Ruan, Ruisheng Zhou, Lushan Song, Bingshuai Li, Yunfeng Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-party training frameworks for decision trees based on secure multi-party computation enable multiple parties to train high-performance models on distributed private data with privacy preservation. The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion.
  In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by $5.5\times \sim 9.3\times$ in communication sizes and $3.9\times \sim 5.3\times$ in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of $3.5\times \sim 6.7\times$. To demonstrate its practicality, Ents requires less than three hours to securely train a decision tree on a widely used real-world dataset (Skin Segmentation) with more than 245,000 samples in the WAN setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansheng Li, Linlin Wang, Tingzhu Wang, Xue Yang, Junwei Luo, Qi Wang, Youming Deng, Wenbin Wang, Xian Sun, Haifeng Li, Bo Dang, Yongjun Zhang, Yi Yu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) in satellite imagery (SAI) benefits promoting intelligent understanding of geospatial scenarios from perception to cognition. In SAI, objects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist rich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects), which makes it necessary to holistically conduct SGG in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) SAI. However, the lack of SGG datasets with large-size VHR SAI has constrained the advancement of SGG in SAI. Due to the complexity of large-size VHR SAI, mining triplets <subject, relationship, object> in large-size VHR SAI heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning. Consequently, SGG models designed for small-size natural imagery are not directly applicable to large-size VHR SAI. To address the scarcity of datasets, this paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in large-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from 512 x 768 to 27,860 x 31,096 pixels, named RSG, encompassing over 210,000 objects and more than 400,000 triplets. To realize SGG in large-size VHR SAI, we propose a context-aware cascade cognition (CAC) framework to understand SAI at three levels: object detection (OBD), pair pruning and relationship prediction. As a fundamental prerequisite for SGG in large-size SAI, a holistic multi-class object detection network (HOD-Net) that can flexibly integrate multi-scale contexts is proposed. With the consideration that there exist a huge amount of object pairs in large-size SAI but only a minority of object pairs contain meaningful relationships, we design a pair proposal generation (PPG) network via adversarial reconstruction to select high-value pairs. Furthermore, a relationship prediction network with context-aware messaging (RPCM) is proposed to predict the relationship types of these pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Raymond</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Gao, Yao Mu, Jinye Qu, Mengkang Hu, Lingyue Guo, Ping Luo, Yanfeng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dual-arm robots offer enhanced versatility and efficiency over single-arm counterparts by enabling concurrent manipulation of multiple objects or cooperative execution of tasks using both arms. However, effectively coordinating the two arms for complex long-horizon tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing task planning methods predominantly focus on single-arm robots or rely on predefined bimanual operations, failing to fully leverage the capabilities of dual-arm systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DAG-Plan, a structured task planning framework tailored for dual-arm robots. DAG-Plan harnesses large language models (LLMs) to decompose intricate tasks into actionable sub-tasks represented as nodes within a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Critically, DAG-Plan dynamically assigns these sub-tasks to the appropriate arm based on real-time environmental observations, enabling parallel and adaptive execution. We evaluate DAG-Plan on the novel Dual-Arm Kitchen Benchmark, comprising 9 sequential tasks with 78 sub-tasks and 26 objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAG-Plan over directly using LLM to generate plans, achieving nearly 50% higher efficiency compared to the single-arm task planning baseline and nearly double the success rate of the dual-arm task planning baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siemen Herremans, Ali Anwar, Siegfried Mercelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has demonstrated impressive performance in various challenging problems such as robotics, board games, and classical arcade games. However, its real-world applications can be hindered by the absence of robustness and safety in the learned policies. More specifically, an RL agent that trains in a certain Markov decision process (MDP) often struggles to perform well in nearly identical MDPs. To address this issue, we employ the framework of Robust MDPs (RMDPs) in a model-based setting and introduce a novel learned transition model. Our method specifically incorporates an auxiliary pessimistic model, updated adversarially, to estimate the worst-case MDP within a Kullback-Leibler uncertainty set. In comparison to several existing works, our work does not impose any additional conditions on the training environment, such as the need for a parametric simulator. To test the effectiveness of the proposed pessimistic model in enhancing policy robustness, we integrate it into a practical RL algorithm, called Robust Model-Based Policy Optimization (RMBPO). Our experimental results indicate a notable improvement in policy robustness on high-dimensional MuJoCo control tasks, with the auxiliary model enhancing the performance of the learned policy in distorted MDPs. We further explore the learned deviation between the proposed auxiliary world model and the nominal model, to examine how pessimism is achieved. By learning a pessimistic world model and demonstrating its role in improving policy robustness, our research contributes towards making (model-based) RL more robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaobin Ling, Xiaoqian Jiang, Yejin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, access to abundant data is crucial for driving research forward. However, such data is often inaccessible due to privacy concerns or high costs, particularly in healthcare domain. Generating synthetic (tabular) data can address this, but existing models typically require substantial amounts of data to train effectively, contradicting our objective to solve data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the substantial volumes of structured data held by many companies, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly understand structured text in non-structured forms could significantly enhance their capabilities across various business scenarios. To this end, we propose evaluation data generation method for assessing LLM's ability in understanding the structure-rich text, which generates structured data of controllable complexity based on manually crafted question templates and generation rules. Building on this generation method, we introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark comprising 6,032 questions across 8 different structured languages and 29 specific tasks. Furthermore, considering human proficiency in rule-based tasks, we also present StrucText-Eval-Hard, which includes 3,016 questions designed to further examine the gap between LLMs and human performance. Results indicate that the best-performing LLM currently achieve an accuracy of 65.0\% on StrucText-Eval-Hard, while human accuracy reaches up to 95.7\%. Moreover, while fine-tuning using StrucText-Eval can enhance existing LLMs' understanding of all structured languages, it does not necessarily improve performance across all task types.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11201">Fine-Tuning or Fine-Failing? Debunking Performance Myths in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Barnett, Zac Brannelly, Stefanus Kurniawan, Sheng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the unique capability to understand and generate human-like text from input queries. When fine-tuned, these models show enhanced performance on domain-specific queries. OpenAI highlights the process of fine-tuning, stating: "To fine-tune a model, you are required to provide at least 10 examples. We typically see clear improvements from fine-tuning on 50 to 100 training examples, but the right number varies greatly based on the exact use case." This study extends this concept to the integration of LLMs within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, which aim to improve accuracy and relevance by leveraging external corpus data for information retrieval. However, RAG's promise of delivering optimal responses often falls short in complex query scenarios. This study aims to specifically examine the effects of fine-tuning LLMs on their ability to extract and integrate contextual data to enhance the performance of RAG systems across multiple domains. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the LLMs' capacity for data extraction and contextual understanding by comparing the accuracy and completeness of fine-tuned models against baseline performances across datasets from multiple domains. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning resulted in a decline in performance compared to the baseline models, contrary to the improvements observed in standalone LLM applications as suggested by OpenAI. This study highlights the need for vigorous investigation and validation of fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: As opposed to evaluating computation and logic-based reasoning, current benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine are primarily focused on question-answering involving domain knowledge and descriptive reasoning. While such qualitative capabilities are vital to medical diagnosis, in real-world scenarios, doctors frequently use clinical calculators that follow quantitative equations and rule-based reasoning paradigms for evidence-based decision support. To this end, we propose MedCalc-Bench, a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. MedCalc-Bench contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance in MedCalc-Bench consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained. While our evaluation results show the potential of LLMs in this area, none of them are effective enough for clinical settings. Common issues include extracting the incorrect entities, not using the correct equation or rules for a calculation task, or incorrectly performing the arithmetic for the computation. We hope our study highlights the quantitative knowledge and reasoning gaps in LLMs within medical settings, encouraging future improvements of LLMs for various clinical calculation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%). Our instruction-following data and models are available at BioMed-VITAL.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous works on Large Language Models (LLMs) have mainly focused on evaluating their helpfulness or harmlessness. However, honesty, another crucial alignment criterion, has received relatively less attention. Dishonest behaviors in LLMs, such as spreading misinformation and defrauding users, eroding user trust, and causing real-world harm, present severe risks that intensify as these models approach superintelligence levels. Enhancing honesty in LLMs addresses critical deficiencies and helps uncover latent capabilities that are not readily expressed. This underscores the urgent need for reliable methods and benchmarks to effectively ensure and evaluate the honesty of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce BeHonest, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed to assess honesty in LLMs comprehensively. BeHonest evaluates three essential aspects of honesty: awareness of knowledge boundaries, avoidance of deceit, and consistency in responses. Building on this foundation, we designed 10 scenarios to evaluate and analyze 9 popular LLMs on the market, including both closed-source and open-source models from different model families with varied model sizes. Our findings indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the honesty of LLMs. We also encourage the AI community to prioritize honesty alignment in LLMs. Our benchmark and code can be found at: \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/BeHonest}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Gabriele Sarti, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity in the field of robotics. However, LLM-based robots are limited to simple, repetitive motions due to the poor integration between language models, robots, and the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLM-based autonomous manipulation through Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The approach involves using a prompted GPT-4 language model to decompose high-level language commands into sequences of motions that can be executed by the robot. The system also employs a YOLO-based perception algorithm, providing visual cues to the LLM, which aids in planning feasible motions within the specific environment. Additionally, an HRC method is proposed by combining teleoperation and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), allowing the LLM-based robot to learn from human guidance. Real-world experiments have been conducted using the Toyota Human Support Robot for manipulation tasks. The outcomes indicate that tasks requiring complex trajectory planning and reasoning over environments can be efficiently accomplished through the incorporation of human demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents that interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) hold significant potential for enhancing user experiences. To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals.

We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, pretraining models have made significant advancements in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and life sciences. The significant advancements in NLP and CV are predominantly driven by the expansion of model parameters and data size, a phenomenon now recognized as the scaling laws. However, research exploring scaling law in molecular pretraining models remains unexplored. In this work, we present Uni-Mol2 , an innovative molecular pretraining model that leverages a two-track transformer to effectively integrate features at the atomic level, graph level, and geometry structure level. Along with this, we systematically investigate the scaling law within molecular pretraining models, characterizing the power-law correlations between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Consequently, we successfully scale Uni-Mol2 to 1.1 billion parameters through pretraining on 800 million conformations, making it the largest molecular pretraining model to date. Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in the downstream tasks as the model size grows. The Uni-Mol2 with 1.1B parameters also outperforms existing methods, achieving an average 27% improvement on the QM9 and 14% on COMPAS-1D dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to extract answers from the short retrieved units. Such an imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia into 4K-token units, which is 30x longer than before. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total units from 22M to 700K. This significantly lowers the burden of retriever, which leads to a remarkable retrieval score: answer recall@1=71% on NQ (previously 52%) and answer recall@2=72% (previously 47%) on HotpotQA (full-wiki). Then we feed the top-k retrieved units ($\approx$ 30K tokens) to an existing long-context LLM to perform zero-shot answer extraction. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ, which is the best known result. LongRAG also achieves 64.3% on HotpotQA (full-wiki), which is on par of the SoTA model. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsi Shi, Xiaofeng Deng, Linhao Luo, Lijuan Xia, Lei Bao, Bei Ye, Fei Du, Shirui Pan, Yuxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in enhancing user experiences across various web applications by analyzing the complicated relationships between users and items. Knowledge graphs(KGs) have been widely used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. However, KGs are known to be noisy and incomplete, which are hard to provide reliable explanations for recommendation results. An explainable recommender system is crucial for the product development and subsequent decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel recommender that synergies Large Language Models (LLMs) and KGs to enhance the recommendation and provide interpretable results. Specifically, we first harness the power of LLMs to augment KG reconstruction. LLMs comprehend and decompose user reviews into new triples that are added into KG. In this way, we can enrich KGs with explainable paths that express user preferences. To enhance the recommendation on augmented KGs, we introduce a novel subgraph reasoning module that effectively measures the importance of nodes and discovers reasoning for recommendation. Finally, these reasoning paths are fed into the LLMs to generate interpretable explanations of the recommendation results. Our approach significantly enhances both the effectiveness and interpretability of recommender systems, especially in cross-selling scenarios where traditional methods falter. The effectiveness of our approach has been rigorously tested on four open real-world datasets, with our methods demonstrating a superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art techniques by an average improvement of 12%. The application of our model in a multinational engineering and technology company cross-selling recommendation system further underscores its practical utility and potential to redefine recommendation practices through improved accuracy and user trust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Zhang, Weitong Zhang, Dongruo Zhou, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mastering multiple tasks through exploration and learning in an environment poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised RL has been introduced to address this challenge by training policies with intrinsic rewards rather than extrinsic rewards. However, current intrinsic reward designs and unsupervised RL algorithms often overlook the heterogeneous nature of collected samples, thereby diminishing their sample efficiency. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a reward-free RL algorithm called \alg. The key idea behind our algorithm is an uncertainty-aware intrinsic reward for exploring the environment and an uncertainty-weighted learning process to handle heterogeneous uncertainty in different samples. Theoretically, we show that in order to find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, GFA-RFE needs to collect $\tilde{O} (H^2 \log N_{\mathcal F} (\epsilon) \mathrm{dim} (\mathcal F) / \epsilon^2 )$ number of episodes, where $\mathcal F$ is the value function class with covering number $N_{\mathcal F} (\epsilon)$ and generalized eluder dimension $\mathrm{dim} (\mathcal F)$. Such a result outperforms all existing reward-free RL algorithms. We further implement and evaluate GFA-RFE across various domains and tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. Experiment results show that GFA-RFE outperforms or is comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art unsupervised RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushun Zhang, Congliang Chen, Ziniu Li, Tian Ding, Chenwei Wu, Yinyu Ye, Zhi-Quan Luo, Ruoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Adam-mini, an optimizer that achieves on-par or better performance than AdamW with 45% to 50% less memory footprint. Adam-mini reduces memory by cutting down the learning rate resources in Adam (i.e., $1/\sqrt{v}$). We find that $\geq$ 90% of these learning rates in $v$ could be harmlessly removed if we (1) carefully partition the parameters into blocks following our proposed principle on Hessian structure; (2) assign a single but good learning rate to each parameter block. We further find that, for each of these parameter blocks, there exists a single high-quality learning rate that can outperform Adam, provided that sufficient resources are available to search it out. We then provide one cost-effective way to find good learning rates and propose Adam-mini. Empirically, we verify that Adam-mini performs on par or better than AdamW on various language models sized from 125M to 7B for pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The reduced memory footprint of Adam-mini also alleviates communication overheads among GPUs and CPUs, thereby increasing throughput. For instance, Adam-mini achieves 49.6% higher throughput than AdamW when pre-training Llama2-7B on $2\times$ A800-80GB GPUs, which saves 33% wall-clock time for pre-training.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17055">Large Language Models Assume People are More Rational than We Really are</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Jiayi Geng, Joshua C. Peterson, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o & 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B & 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Bortoletto, Constantin Ruhdorfer, Lei Shi, Andreas Bulling</p>
<p>Abstract: While numerous works have assessed the generative performance of language models (LMs) on tasks requiring Theory of Mind reasoning, research into the models' internal representation of mental states remains limited. Recent work has used probing to demonstrate that LMs can represent beliefs of themselves and others. However, these claims are accompanied by limited evaluation, making it difficult to assess how mental state representations are affected by model design and training choices. We report an extensive benchmark with various LM types with different model sizes, fine-tuning approaches, and prompt designs to study the robustness of mental state representations and memorisation issues within the probes. Our results show that the quality of models' internal representations of the beliefs of others increases with model size and, more crucially, with fine-tuning. We are the first to study how prompt variations impact probing performance on theory of mind tasks. We demonstrate that models' representations are sensitive to prompt variations, even when such variations should be beneficial. Finally, we complement previous activation editing experiments on Theory of Mind tasks and show that it is possible to improve models' reasoning performance by steering their activations without the need to train any probe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bonian Jia, Huiyao Chen, Yueheng Sun, Meishan Zhang, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Opinion Expression Identification (OEI) is essential in NLP for applications ranging from voice assistants to depression diagnosis. This study extends OEI to encompass multimodal inputs, underlining the significance of auditory cues in delivering emotional subtleties beyond the capabilities of text. We introduce a novel multimodal OEI (MOEI) task, integrating text and speech to mirror real-world scenarios. Utilizing CMU MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets, we construct the CI-MOEI dataset. Additionally, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is applied to the MPQA dataset to obtain the CIM-OEI dataset. We design a template for the OEI task to take full advantage of the generative power of large language models (LLMs). Advancing further, we propose an LLM-driven method STOEI, which combines speech and text modal to identify opinion expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that MOEI significantly improves the performance while our method outperforms existing methods by 9.20\% and obtains SOTA results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Ong, Amjad Almahairi, Vincent Wu, Wei-Lin Chiang, Tianhao Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, M Waleed Kadous, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Planetary exploration requires traversal in environments with rugged terrains. In addition, Mars rovers and other planetary exploration robots often carry sensitive scientific experiments and components onboard, which must be protected from mechanical harm. This paper deals with an active suspension system focused on chassis stabilisation and an efficient traversal method while encountering unavoidable obstacles. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) was applied along with Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control to stabilise the chassis and traverse large obstacles at low speeds. The model uses the rover's distance from surrounding obstacles, the height of the obstacle, and the chassis' orientation to actuate the control links of the suspension accurately. Simulations carried out in the Gazebo environment are used to validate the proposed active system.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18937">Federated Graph Semantic and Structural Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenke Huang, Guancheng Wan, Mang Ye, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated graph learning collaboratively learns a global graph neural network with distributed graphs, where the non-independent and identically distributed property is one of the major challenges. Most relative arts focus on traditional distributed tasks like images and voices, incapable of graph structures. This paper firstly reveals that local client distortion is brought by both node-level semantics and graph-level structure. First, for node-level semantics, we find that contrasting nodes from distinct classes is beneficial to provide a well-performing discrimination. We pull the local node towards the global node of the same class and push it away from the global node of different classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural network possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency relationships. However, aligning each node with adjacent nodes hinders discrimination due to the potential class inconsistency. We transform the adjacency relationships into the similarity distribution and leverage the global model to distill the relation knowledge into the local model, which preserves the structural information and discriminability of the local model. Empirical results on three graph datasets manifest the superiority of the proposed method over its counterparts.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19057">Segment Anything Model for automated image data annotation: empirical studies using text prompts from Grounding DINO</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuseini Mumuni, Alhassan Mumuni</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive performance in zero-shot object detection and image segmentation, respectively. Together, they have a great potential to revolutionize applications in zero-shot semantic segmentation or data annotation. Yet, in specialized domains like medical image segmentation, objects of interest (e.g., organs, tissues, and tumors) may not fall in existing class names. To address this problem, the referring expression comprehension (REC) ability of Grounding DINO is leveraged to detect arbitrary targets by their language descriptions. However, recent studies have highlighted severe limitation of the REC framework in this application setting owing to its tendency to make false positive predictions when the target is absent in the given image. And, while this bottleneck is central to the prospect of open-set semantic segmentation, it is still largely unknown how much improvement can be achieved by studying the prediction errors. To this end, we perform empirical studies on six publicly available datasets across different domains and reveal that these errors consistently follow a predictable pattern and can, thus, be mitigated by a simple strategy. Specifically, we show that false positive detections with appreciable confidence scores generally occupy large image areas and can usually be filtered by their relative sizes. More importantly, we expect these observations to inspire future research in improving REC-based detection and automated segmentation. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of SAM on multiple datasets from various specialized domains and report significant improvements in segmentation performance and annotation time savings over manual approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a multi-scale differentiable brain modeling workflow utilizing BrainPy, a unique differentiable brain simulator that combines accurate brain simulation with powerful gradient-based optimization. We leverage this capability of BrainPy across different brain scales. At the single-neuron level, we implement differentiable neuron models and employ gradient methods to optimize their fit to electrophysiological data. On the network level, we incorporate connectomic data to construct biologically constrained network models. Finally, to replicate animal behavior, we train these models on cognitive tasks using gradient-based learning rules. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and speed in fitting generalized leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley single neuron models. Additionally, training a biologically-informed network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons on working memory tasks successfully replicates observed neural activity and synaptic weight distributions. Overall, our differentiable multi-scale simulation approach offers a promising tool to bridge neuroscience data across electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Crawford, Edward B. Duffy, Iman Evazzade, Torsten Foehr, Gregory Robbins, Debbrata Kumar Saha, Jiya Varma, Marcin Ziolkowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous agents working together towards solving tasks.</p>
