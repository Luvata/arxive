<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekin Aky\"urek, Mehul Damani, Linlu Qiu, Han Guo, Yoon Kim, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have shown impressive performance on tasks within their training distribution, but often struggle with novel problems requiring complex reasoning. We investigate the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT) -- updating model parameters temporarily during inference using a loss derived from input data -- as a mechanism for improving models' reasoning capabilities, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as a benchmark. Through systematic experimentation, we identify three crucial components for successful TTT: (1) initial finetuning on similar tasks (2) auxiliary task format and augmentations (3) per-instance training. TTT significantly improves performance on ARC tasks, achieving up to 6x improvement in accuracy compared to base fine-tuned models; applying TTT to an 8B-parameter language model, we achieve 53% accuracy on the ARC's public validation set, improving the state-of-the-art by nearly 25% for public and purely neural approaches. By ensembling our method with recent program generation approaches, we get SoTA public validation accuracy of 61.9%, matching the average human score. Our findings suggest that explicit symbolic search is not the only path to improved abstract reasoning in neural language models; additional test-time applied to continued training on few-shot examples can also be extremely effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Han, Aaron Ceross, Sarim Ather, Jeroen H. M. Bergmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical device software (MDSW) represents a transformative clinical technology, attracting increasing attention within both the medical community and the regulators. In this study, we leverage a data-driven approach to automatically extract and analyze AI-enabled medical devices (AIMD) from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) regulatory database. The continued increase in publicly available regulatory data requires scalable methods for analysis. Automation of regulatory information screening is essential to create reproducible insights that can be quickly updated in an ever changing medical device landscape. More than 4 million entries were assessed, identifying 2,174 MDSW registrations, including 531 standalone applications and 1,643 integrated within medical devices, of which 43 were AI-enabled. It was shown that the leading medical specialties utilizing AIMD include respiratory (20.5%), ophthalmology/endocrinology (12.8%), and orthopedics (10.3%). This approach greatly improves the speed of data extracting providing a greater ability to compare and contrast. This study provides the first extensive, data-driven exploration of AIMD in China, showcasing the potential of automated regulatory data analysis in understanding and advancing the landscape of AI in medical technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Abul Hassan, Pu Sun, Xiangnan Zhou, Lisanne Kraft, Kelsey T Hadfield, Katjana Ehrlich, Jinyi Qi, Andrew Birkeland, Laura Marcu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel data-centric approach to improve real-time surgical guidance using fiber-based fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm). A key aspect of the methodology is the accurate detection of the aiming beam, which is essential for localizing points used to map FLIm measurements onto the tissue region within the surgical field. The primary challenge arises from the complex and variable conditions encountered in the surgical environment, particularly in Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS). Uneven illumination in the surgical field can cause reflections, reduce contrast, and results in inconsistent color representation, further complicating aiming beam detection. To overcome these challenges, an instance segmentation model was developed using a data-centric training strategy that improves accuracy by minimizing label noise and enhancing detection robustness. The model was evaluated on a dataset comprising 40 in vivo surgical videos, demonstrating a median detection rate of 85%. This performance was maintained when the model was integrated in a clinical system, achieving a similar detection rate of 85% during TORS procedures conducted in patients. The system's computational efficiency, measured at approximately 24 frames per second (FPS), was sufficient for real-time surgical guidance. This study enhances the reliability of FLIm-based aiming beam detection in complex surgical environments, advancing the feasibility of real-time, image-guided interventions for improved surgical precision</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07426">Evaluating Detection Thresholds: The Impact of False Positives and Negatives on Super-Resolution Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh K. Gharamaleki, Brandon Helfield, Hassan Rivaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound imaging with ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) offers a high-resolution view of microvascular structures. Yet, ULM image quality heavily relies on precise microbubble (MB) detection. Despite the crucial role of localization algorithms, there has been limited focus on the practical pitfalls in MB detection tasks such as setting the detection threshold. This study examines how False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs) affect ULM image quality by systematically adding controlled detection errors to simulated data. Results indicate that while both FP and FN rates impact Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) similarly, increasing FP rates from 0\% to 20\% decreases Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 7\%, whereas same FN rates cause a greater drop of around 45\%. Moreover, dense MB regions are more resilient to detection errors, while sparse regions show high sensitivity, showcasing the need for robust MB detection frameworks to enhance super-resolution imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwei Xie, Jie Yin, Zihao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the issues of insufficient robustness, unstable features, and data noise interference in existing network attack detection and identification models, this paper proposes an attack traffic detection and identification method based on temporal spectrum. First, traffic data is segmented by a sliding window to construct a feature sequence and a corresponding label sequence for network traffic. Next, the proposed spectral label generation methods, SSPE and COAP, are applied to transform the label sequence into spectral labels and the feature sequence into temporal features. Spectral labels and temporal features are used to capture and represent behavioral patterns of attacks. Finally, the constructed temporal features and spectral labels are used to train models, which subsequently detects and identifies network attack behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, models trained with the SSPE or COAP method improve identification accuracy by 10%, and exhibit strong robustness, particularly in noisy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinglin Xie, Xinyi Hou, Yanjie Zhao, Kai Chen, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Impersonation tactics, such as app squatting and app cloning, have posed longstanding challenges in mobile app stores, where malicious actors exploit the names and reputations of popular apps to deceive users. With the rapid growth of Large Language Model (LLM) stores like GPT Store and FlowGPT, these issues have similarly surfaced, threatening the integrity of the LLM app ecosystem. In this study, we present the first large-scale analysis of LLM app squatting and cloning using our custom-built tool, LLMappCrazy. LLMappCrazy covers 14 squatting generation techniques and integrates Levenshtein distance and BERT-based semantic analysis to detect cloning by analyzing app functional similarities. Using this tool, we generated variations of the top 1000 app names and found over 5,000 squatting apps in the dataset. Additionally, we observed 3,509 squatting apps and 9,575 cloning cases across six major platforms. After sampling, we find that 18.7% of the squatting apps and 4.9% of the cloning apps exhibited malicious behavior, including phishing, malware distribution, fake content dissemination, and aggressive ad injection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07563">Improving Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion through In-Context Knowledge Retrieval with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongrui Han, Mingyu Cui, Jiawen Kang, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is a crucial step in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, responsible for mapping grapheme to corresponding phonetic representations. However, it faces ambiguities problems where the same grapheme can represent multiple phonemes depending on contexts, posing a challenge for G2P conversion. Inspired by the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling context-aware scenarios, contextual G2P conversion systems with LLMs' in-context knowledge retrieval (ICKR) capabilities are proposed to promote disambiguation capability. The efficacy of incorporating ICKR into G2P conversion systems is demonstrated thoroughly on the Librig2p dataset. In particular, the best contextual G2P conversion system using ICKR outperforms the baseline with weighted average phoneme error rate (PER) reductions of 2.0% absolute (28.9% relative). Using GPT-4 in the ICKR system can increase of 3.5% absolute (3.8% relative) on the Librig2p dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Anand, Akshit Gupta, Nishchay Yadav, Shaurya Bajaj</p>
<p>Abstract: Bug fixing and code generation have been core research topics in software development for many years. The recent explosive growth in Large Language Models has completely transformed these spaces, putting in reach incredibly powerful tools for both. In this survey, 27 recent papers have been reviewed and split into two groups: one dedicated to Automated Program Repair (APR) and LLM integration and the other to code generation using LLMs. The first group consists of new methods for bug detection and repair, which include locating semantic errors, security vulnerabilities, and runtime failure bugs. The place of LLMs in reducing manual debugging efforts is emphasized in this work by APR toward context-aware fixes, with innovations that boost accuracy and efficiency in automatic debugging. The second group dwells on code generation, providing an overview of both general-purpose LLMs fine-tuned for programming and task-specific models. It also presents methods to improve code generation, such as identifier-aware training, fine-tuning at the instruction level, and incorporating semantic code structures. This survey work contrasts the methodologies in APR and code generation to identify trends such as using LLMs, feedback loops to enable iterative code improvement and open-source models. It also discusses the challenges of achieving functional correctness and security and outlines future directions for research in LLM-based software development.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07618">Direct Preference Optimization Using Sparse Feature-Level Constraints</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Yin, Chak Tou Leong, Hongbo Zhang, Minjun Zhu, Hanqi Yan, Qiang Zhang, Yulan He, Wenjie Li, Jun Wang, Yue Zhang, Linyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Zampella, Urtzi Otamendi, Xabier Belaunzaran, Arkaitz Artetxe, Igor G. Olaizola, Giuseppe Longo, Basilio Sierra</p>
<p>Abstract: Scheduling problems pose significant challenges in resource, industry, and operational management. This paper addresses the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMS) with setup times and resources using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The study introduces the Reinforcement Learning environment and conducts empirical analyses, comparing MARL with Single-Agent algorithms. The experiments employ various deep neural network policies for single- and Multi-Agent approaches. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Maskable extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in Single-Agent scenarios and the Multi-Agent PPO algorithm in Multi-Agent setups. While Single-Agent algorithms perform adequately in reduced scenarios, Multi-Agent approaches reveal challenges in cooperative learning but a scalable capacity. This research contributes insights into applying MARL techniques to scheduling optimization, emphasizing the need for algorithmic sophistication balanced with scalability for intelligent scheduling solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the proliferation of the Large Language Model (LLM), the concept of World Models (WM) has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the AI research community, especially in the context of AI agents. It is arguably evolving into an essential foundation for building AI agent systems. A WM is intended to help the agent predict the future evolution of environmental states or help the agent fill in missing information so that it can plan its actions and behave safely. The safety property of WM plays a key role in their effective use in critical applications. In this work, we review and analyze the impacts of the current state-of-the-art in WM technology from the point of view of trustworthiness and safety based on a comprehensive survey and the fields of application envisaged. We provide an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art WMs and derive technical research challenges and their impact in order to call on the research community to collaborate on improving the safety and trustworthiness of WM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07691">New Emerged Security and Privacy of Pre-trained Model: a Survey and Outlook</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Yang, Tianqing Zhu, Chi Liu, WanLei Zhou, Shui Yu, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Thanks to the explosive growth of data and the development of computational resources, it is possible to build pre-trained models that can achieve outstanding performance on various tasks, such as neural language processing, computer vision, and more. Despite their powerful capabilities, pre-trained models have also sparked attention to the emerging security challenges associated with their real-world applications. Security and privacy issues, such as leaking privacy information and generating harmful responses, have seriously undermined users' confidence in these powerful models. Concerns are growing as model performance improves dramatically. Researchers are eager to explore the unique security and privacy issues that have emerged, their distinguishing factors, and how to defend against them. However, the current literature lacks a clear taxonomy of emerging attacks and defenses for pre-trained models, which hinders a high-level and comprehensive understanding of these questions. To fill the gap, we conduct a systematical survey on the security risks of pre-trained models, proposing a taxonomy of attack and defense methods based on the accessibility of pre-trained models' input and weights in various security test scenarios. This taxonomy categorizes attacks and defenses into No-Change, Input-Change, and Model-Change approaches. With the taxonomy analysis, we capture the unique security and privacy issues of pre-trained models, categorizing and summarizing existing security issues based on their characteristics. In addition, we offer a timely and comprehensive review of each category's strengths and limitations. Our survey concludes by highlighting potential new research opportunities in the security and privacy of pre-trained models.</p>

ChatGPT not only surpassed previous models in terms of parameters and the scale of its pretraining corpus but also achieved revolutionary performance improvements through fine-tuning on a vast amount of high-quality, human-annotated data. This progress has led enterprises and research institutions to recognize that building smarter and more powerful models relies on rich and high-quality datasets. Consequently, the construction and optimization of datasets have become a critical focus in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper summarizes the current state of pretraining and fine-tuning data for training large-scale language models, covering aspects such as data scale, collection methods, data types and characteristics, processing workflows, and provides an overview of available open-source datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07722">Is Cognition consistent with Perception? Assessing and Mitigating Multimodal Knowledge Conflicts in Document Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Shao, Chuwei Luo, Zhaoqing Zhu, Hangdi Xing, Zhi Yu, Qi Zheng, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant industrial demand in recent years. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models to possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, current MLLMs often face conflicts between perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an example, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding visual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that the MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the information it "sees" and what it "understands." Such conflicts challenge the intuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the performance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts between cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&P) knowledge conflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflicts, and systematically assess them with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even GPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 68.6% C&P consistency. To mitigate the C&P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge Consistency Fine-tuning. This method first ensures task-specific consistency and then connects the cognitive and perceptual knowledge. Our method significantly reduces C&P knowledge conflicts across all tested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual tasks in most scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Alberto de Oliveira Lima</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of capturing the complexities of legal knowledge by proposing a multi-layered embedding-based retrieval method for legal and legislative texts. Creating embeddings not only for individual articles but also for their components (paragraphs, clauses) and structural groupings (books, titles, chapters, etc), we seek to capture the subtleties of legal information through the use of dense vectors of embeddings, representing it at varying levels of granularity. Our method meets various information needs by allowing the Retrieval Augmented Generation system to provide accurate responses, whether for specific segments or entire sections, tailored to the user's query. We explore the concepts of aboutness, semantic chunking, and inherent hierarchy within legal texts, arguing that this method enhances the legal information retrieval. Despite the focus being on Brazil's legislative methods and the Brazilian Constitution, which follow a civil law tradition, our findings should in principle be applicable across different legal systems, including those adhering to common law traditions. Furthermore, the principles of the proposed method extend beyond the legal domain, offering valuable insights for organizing and retrieving information in any field characterized by information encoded in hierarchical text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Jaleed Khan, Manu Vatish, Gabriel Davis Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Antepartum Cardiotocography (CTG) is vital for fetal health monitoring, but traditional methods like the Dawes-Redman system are often limited by high inter-observer variability, leading to inconsistent interpretations and potential misdiagnoses. This paper introduces PatchCTG, a transformer-based model specifically designed for CTG analysis, employing patch-based tokenisation, instance normalisation and channel-independent processing to capture essential local and global temporal dependencies within CTG signals. PatchCTG was evaluated on the Oxford Maternity (OXMAT) dataset, comprising over 20,000 CTG traces across diverse clinical outcomes after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. With extensive hyperparameter optimisation, PatchCTG achieved an AUC of 77%, with specificity of 88% and sensitivity of 57% at Youden's index threshold, demonstrating adaptability to various clinical needs. Testing across varying temporal thresholds showed robust predictive performance, particularly with finetuning on data closer to delivery, achieving a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 88% for near-delivery cases. These findings suggest the potential of PatchCTG to enhance clinical decision-making in antepartum care by providing a reliable, objective tool for fetal health assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Schreck, Yingkai Sha, William Chapman, Dhamma Kimpara, Judith Berner, Seth McGinnis, Arnold Kazadi, Negin Sobhani, Ben Kirk, David John Gagne II</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for numerical weather prediction (NWP) have significantly transformed atmospheric modeling. AI NWP models outperform traditional physics-based systems, such as the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), across several global metrics while requiring fewer computational resources. However, existing AI NWP models face limitations related to training datasets and timestep choices, often resulting in artifacts that reduce model performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT) framework, developed at NSF NCAR. CREDIT provides a flexible, scalable, and user-friendly platform for training and deploying AI-based atmospheric models on high-performance computing systems. It offers an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, democratizing access to advanced AI NWP capabilities. We demonstrate CREDIT's potential through WXFormer, a novel deterministic vision transformer designed to predict atmospheric states autoregressively, addressing common AI NWP issues like compounding error growth with techniques such as spectral normalization, padding, and multi-step training. Additionally, to illustrate CREDIT's flexibility and state-of-the-art model comparisons, we train the FUXI architecture within this framework. Our findings show that both FUXI and WXFormer, trained on six-hourly ERA5 hybrid sigma-pressure levels, generally outperform IFS HRES in 10-day forecasts, offering potential improvements in efficiency and forecast accuracy. CREDIT's modular design enables researchers to explore various models, datasets, and training configurations, fostering innovation within the scientific community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navpreet Kaur, Juntao Chen, Yingdong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport is a powerful framework for the efficient allocation of resources between sources and targets. However, traditional models often struggle to scale effectively in the presence of large and heterogeneous populations. In this work, we introduce a discrete optimal transport framework designed to handle large-scale, heterogeneous target populations, characterized by type distributions. We address two scenarios: one where the type distribution of targets is known, and one where it is unknown. For the known distribution, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to achieve optimal resource allocation. In the case of unknown distribution, we develop a federated learning-based approach that enables efficient computation of the optimal transport scheme while preserving privacy. Case studies are provided to evaluate the performance of our learning algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Chiumento, Mingming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in medical diagnostics, particularly in radiology, where datasets such as X-rays are paired with human-generated diagnostic reports. However, a significant research gap exists in the neuroimaging field, especially for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, due to the lack of comprehensive diagnostic reports that can be utilized for model fine-tuning. This paper addresses this gap by generating synthetic diagnostic reports using GPT-4o-mini on structured data from the OASIS-4 dataset, which comprises 663 patients. Using the synthetic reports as ground truth for training and validation, we then generated neurological reports directly from the images in the dataset leveraging the pre-trained BiomedCLIP and T5 models. Our proposed method achieved a BLEU-4 score of 0.1827, ROUGE-L score of 0.3719, and METEOR score of 0.4163, revealing its potential in generating clinically relevant and accurate diagnostic reports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'elanie Roschewitz, Raghav Mehta, Charles Jones, Ben Glocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Shifts in data distribution can substantially harm the performance of clinical AI models. Hence, various methods have been developed to detect the presence of such shifts at deployment time. However, root causes of dataset shifts are varied, and the choice of shift mitigation strategies is highly dependent on the precise type of shift encountered at test time. As such, detecting test-time dataset shift is not sufficient: precisely identifying which type of shift has occurred is critical. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised dataset shift identification framework, effectively distinguishing between prevalence shift (caused by a change in the label distribution), covariate shift (caused by a change in input characteristics) and mixed shifts (simultaneous prevalence and covariate shifts). We discuss the importance of self-supervised encoders for detecting subtle covariate shifts and propose a novel shift detector leveraging both self-supervised encoders and task model outputs for improved shift detection. We report promising results for the proposed shift identification framework across three different imaging modalities (chest radiography, digital mammography, and retinal fundus images) on five types of real-world dataset shifts, using four large publicly available datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Tyler Johnson, Minsik Cho, Emad Soroush</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor parallelism provides an effective way to increase server large language model (LLM) inference efficiency despite adding an additional communication cost. However, as server LLMs continue to scale in size, they will need to be distributed across more devices, magnifying the communication cost. One way to approach this problem is with quantization, but current methods for LLMs tend to avoid quantizing the features that tensor parallelism needs to communicate. Taking advantage of consistent outliers in communicated features, we introduce a quantization method that reduces communicated values on average from 16 bits to 4.2 bits while preserving nearly all of the original performance. For instance, our method maintains around 98.0% and 99.5% of Gemma 2 27B's and Llama 2 13B's original performance, respectively, averaged across all tasks we evaluated on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Sidorov, Koos van der Linden, Gon\c{c}alo Homem de Almeida Correia, Mathijs de Weerdt, Emir Demirovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern software for propositional satisfiability problems gives a powerful automated reasoning toolkit, capable of outputting not only a satisfiable/unsatisfiable signal but also a justification of unsatisfiability in the form of resolution proof (or a more expressive proof), which is commonly used for verification purposes. Empirically, modern SAT solvers produce relatively short proofs, however, there are no inherent guarantees that these proofs cannot be significantly reduced. This paper proposes a novel branch-and-bound algorithm for finding the shortest resolution proofs; to this end, we introduce a layer list representation of proofs that groups clauses by their level of indirection. As we show, this representation breaks all permutational symmetries, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-art symmetry-breaking and informing the design of a novel workflow for proof minimization. In addition to that, we design pruning procedures that reason on proof length lower bound, clause subsumption, and dominance. Our experiments suggest that the proofs from state-of-the-art solvers could be shortened by 30-60% on the instances from SAT Competition 2002 and by 25-50% on small synthetic formulas. When treated as an algorithm for finding the shortest proof, our approach solves twice as many instances as the previous work based on SAT solving and reduces the time to optimality by orders of magnitude for the instances solved by both approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Fauber</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that Gini coefficients can be used as unified metrics to evaluate many-versus-many (all-to-all) similarity in vector spaces. Our analysis of various image datasets shows that images with the highest Gini coefficients tend to be the most similar to one another, while images with the lowest Gini coefficients are the least similar. We also show that this relationship holds true for vectorized text embeddings from various corpuses, highlighting the consistency of our method and its broad applicability across different types of data. Additionally, we demonstrate that selecting machine learning training samples that closely match the distribution of the testing dataset is far more important than ensuring data diversity. Selection of exemplary and iconic training samples with higher Gini coefficients leads to significantly better model performance compared to simply having a diverse training set with lower Gini coefficients. Thus, Gini coefficients can serve as effective criteria for selecting machine learning training samples, with our selection method outperforming random sampling methods in very sparse information settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Cebrian, Jan Arne Telle</p>
<p>Abstract: Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We investigate this attribution problem using formal language theory, specifically language identification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. By modeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite text samples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that due to the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mild assumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it is theoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty. This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformer architectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring, significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findings highlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed by adversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dymitr Ruta, Corrado Mio, Ernesto Damiani</p>
<p>Abstract: Trees continue to fascinate with their natural beauty and as engineering masterpieces optimal with respect to several independent criteria. Pythagorean tree is a well-known fractal design that realistically mimics the natural tree branching structures. We study various types of Pythagorean-like fractal trees with different shapes of the base, branching angles and relaxed scales in an attempt to identify and explain which variants are the closest match to the branching structures commonly observed in the natural world. Pursuing simultaneously the realism and minimalism of the fractal tree model, we have developed a flexibly parameterised and fast algorithm to grow and visually examine deep Pythagorean-inspired fractal trees with the capability to orderly over- or underestimate the Leonardo da Vinci's tree branching rule as well as control various imbalances and branching angles. We tested the realism of the generated fractal tree images by means of the classification accuracy of detecting natural tree with the transfer-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Having empirically established the parameters of the fractal trees that maximize the CNN's natural tree class classification accuracy we have translated them back to the scales and angles of branches and came to the interesting conclusions that support the da Vinci branching rule and golden ratio based scaling for both the shape of the branch and imbalance between the child branches, and claim the flexibly parameterized fractal trees can be used to generate artificial examples to train robust detectors of different species of trees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juanhui Li, Sreyashi Nag, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Sheikh Sarwar, Limeng Cui, Hansu Gu, Suhang Wang, Qi He, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs. LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a neuropsychological approach to the explainability of artificial neural networks, which involves using concepts from human cognitive psychology as relevant heuristic references for developing synthetic explanatory frameworks that align with human modes of thought. The analogical concepts mobilized here, which are intended to create such an epistemological bridge, are those of categorization and similarity, as these notions are particularly suited to the categorical "nature" of the reconstructive information processing performed by artificial neural networks. Our study aims to reveal a unique process of synthetic cognition, that of the categorical convergence of highly activated tokens. We attempt to explain this process with the idea that the categorical segment created by a neuron is actually the result of a superposition of categorical sub-dimensions within its input vector space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert L. Bray</p>
<p>Abstract: This tutorial addresses the challenge of incorporating large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in a data analytics class. It details several new in-class and out-of-class teaching techniques enabled by AI. For example, instructors can parallelize instruction by having students interact with different custom-made GPTs to learn different parts of an analysis and then teach each other what they learned from their AIs. For another example, instructors can turn problem sets into AI tutoring sessions, whereby a custom-made GPT guides a student through the problems, and the student uploads the chatlog for their homework submission. For a third example, you can assign different labs to each section of your class and have each section create AI assistants to help the other sections work through their labs. This tutorial advocates the programming in the English paradigm, in which students express the desired data transformations in prose and then use AI to generate the corresponding code. Students can wrangle data more effectively by programming in English than by manipulating in Excel. However, some students will program in English better than others, so you will still derive a robust grade distribution (at least with current LLMs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reliable tool for medical professionals to detect and diagnose abnormal heart waves that may cause cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a methodology to create a new high-quality heartbeat dataset from all 48 of the MIT-BIH recordings. The proposed approach computes an optimal heartbeat size, by eliminating outliers and calculating the mean value over 10-second windows. This results in independent QRS-centered heartbeats avoiding the mixing of successive heartbeats problem. The quality of the newly constructed dataset has been evaluated and compared with existing datasets. To this end, we built and trained a PyTorch 1-D Resnet architecture model that achieved 99.24\% accuracy with a 5.7\% improvement compared to other methods. Additionally, downsampling the dataset has improved the model's execution time by 33\% and reduced 3x memory usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data is the new oil of the 21st century. The growing trend of trading data for greater welfare has led to the emergence of data markets. A data market is any mechanism whereby the exchange of data products including datasets and data derivatives takes place as a result of data buyers and data sellers being in contact with one another, either directly or through mediating agents. It serves as a coordinating mechanism by which several functions, including the pricing and the distribution of data as the most important ones, interact to make the value of data fully exploited and enhanced. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of this important and emerging direction from the aspects of data search, data productization, data transaction, data pricing, revenue allocation as well as privacy, security, and trust issues. We also investigate the government policies and industry status of data markets across different countries and different domains. Finally, we identify the unresolved challenges and discuss possible future directions for the development of data markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Zhang, Mingyu Jin, Dong Shu, Taowen Wang, Dongfang Liu, Xiaobo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large language models (LLM) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. Many users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLM model security challenges like the language model not giving the correct answer. Although there is currently a large amount of research on black-box attacks, most of these black-box attacks use random and heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we propose our target-driven black-box attack method to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the attack text to redefine the attack's goal. We transform the distance maximization problem into two convex optimization problems based on the attack goal to solve the attack text and estimate the covariance. Furthermore, the projected gradient descent algorithm solves the vector corresponding to the attack text. Our target-driven black-box attack approach includes two attack strategies: token manipulation and misinformation attack. Experimental results on multiple Large Language Models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method.</p>

In this paper, we present an exhaustive review of the latest advancements in graph representation learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, tailored to handle graph-structured data, excel in deriving insights and predictions from intricate relational information, making them invaluable for tasks involving such data. Graph representation learning, a pivotal approach in analyzing graph-structured data, facilitates numerous downstream tasks and applications across machine learning, data mining, biomedicine, and healthcare.

We introduce a GNN equipped with an advanced high-order pooling function, adept at capturing complex node interactions within graph-structured data. This pooling function significantly enhances the GNN's efficacy in both node- and graph-level tasks. Additionally, we propose a molecular graph generative model with a GNN as its core framework. This GNN backbone is proficient in learning invariant and equivariant molecular characteristics. Employing these features, the molecular graph generative model is capable of simultaneously learning and generating molecular graphs with atom-bond structures and precise atom positions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocan Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Ilia Smirnov, Scott Sanner, Baher Abdulhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing myopic pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. Effective signal control, however, inherently requires a broader spatial scope, as traffic conditions further upstream can significantly impact traffic at the current location. This paper introduces a novel concept based on the Markov chain theory, namely multi-hop upstream pressure, that generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the present queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Design and manufacturing of integrated circuits predominantly use a globally distributed semiconductor supply chain involving diverse entities. The modern semiconductor supply chain has been designed to boost production efficiency, but is filled with major security concerns such as malicious modifications (hardware Trojans), reverse engineering (RE), and cloning. While being deployed, digital systems are also subject to a plethora of threats such as power, timing, and electromagnetic (EM) side channel attacks. Many Design-for-Security (DFS) solutions have been proposed to deal with these vulnerabilities, and such solutions (DFS) relays on strategic modifications (e.g., logic locking, side channel resilient masking, and dummy logic insertion) of the digital designs for ensuring a higher level of security. However, most of these DFS strategies lack robust formalism, are often not human-understandable, and require an extensive amount of human expert effort during their development/use. All of these factors make it difficult to keep up with the ever growing number of microelectronic vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose X-DFS, an explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided DFS solution-space exploration approach that can dramatically cut down the mitigation strategy development/use time while enriching our understanding of the vulnerability by providing human-understandable decision rationale. We implement X-DFS and comprehensively evaluate it for reverse engineering threats (SAIL, SWEEP, and OMLA) and formalize a generalized mechanism for applying X-DFS to defend against other threats such as hardware Trojans, fault attacks, and side channel attacks for seamless future extensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Severe collisions can result from aggressive driving and poor road conditions, emphasizing the need for effective monitoring to ensure safety. Smartphones, with their array of built-in sensors, offer a practical and affordable solution for road-sensing. However, the lack of reliable, standardized datasets has hindered progress in assessing road conditions and driving patterns. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive dataset derived from smartphone sensors, which surpasses existing datasets by incorporating a diverse range of sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, gravity, orientation, and uncalibrated sensors. These sensors capture extensive parameters such as acceleration force, gravitation, rotation rate, magnetic field strength, and vehicle speed, providing a detailed understanding of road conditions and driving behaviors. The dataset is designed to enhance road safety, infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and urban planning. By making this dataset available to the community, the study aims to foster collaboration, inspire further research, and facilitate the development of innovative solutions in intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirti Bhagat, Kinshuk Vasisht, Danish Pruthi</p>
<p>Abstract: While a large body of work inspects language models for biases concerning gender, race, occupation and religion, biases of geographical nature are relatively less explored. Some recent studies benchmark the degree to which large language models encode geospatial knowledge. However, the impact of the encoded geographical knowledge (or lack thereof) on real-world applications has not been documented. In this work, we examine large language models for two common scenarios that require geographical knowledge: (a) travel recommendations and (b) geo-anchored story generation. Specifically, we study four popular language models, and across about $100$K travel requests, and $200$K story generations, we observe that travel recommendations corresponding to poorer countries are less unique with fewer location references, and stories from these regions more often convey emotions of hardship and sadness compared to those from wealthier nations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Kontras, Thomas Strypsteen, Christos Chatzichristos, Paul P. Liang, Matthew Blaschko, Maarten De Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neeratyoy Mallik, Maciej Janowski, Johannes Hog, Herilalaina Rakotoarison, Aaron Klein, Josif Grabocka, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling model sizes to scale performance has worked remarkably well for the current large language models paradigm. The research and empirical findings of various scaling studies led to novel scaling results and laws that guides subsequent research. High training costs for contemporary scales of data and models result in a lack of thorough understanding of how to tune and arrive at such training setups. One direction to ameliorate the cost of pretraining large models is to warmstart the large-scale training from smaller models that are cheaper to tune. In this work, we attempt to understand if the behavior of optimal hyperparameters can be retained under warmstarting for scaling. We explore simple operations that allow the application of theoretically motivated methods of zero-shot transfer of optimal hyperparameters using {\mu}Transfer. We investigate the aspects that contribute to the speedup in convergence and the preservation of stable training dynamics under warmstarting with {\mu}Transfer. We find that shrinking smaller model weights, zero-padding, and perturbing the resulting larger model with scaled initialization from {\mu}P enables effective warmstarting of $\mut{}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh K. Gharamaleki, Brandon Helfield, Hassan Rivaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Betteti, Giacomo Baggio, Francesco Bullo, Sandro Zampieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Morafah, Hojin Chang, Chen Chen, Bill Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL methods often assume clean annotated datasets, impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. In reality, noisy labels are prevalent, posing significant challenges to FL performance. Prior approaches attempt label correction and robust training techniques but exhibit limited efficacy, particularly under high noise levels. This paper introduces ClipFL (Federated Learning Client Pruning), a novel framework addressing noisy labels from a fresh perspective. ClipFL identifies and excludes noisy clients based on their performance on a clean validation dataset, tracked using a Noise Candidacy Score (NCS). The framework comprises three phases: pre-client pruning to identify potential noisy clients and calculate their NCS, client pruning to exclude a percentage of clients with the highest NCS, and post-client pruning for fine-tuning the global model with standard FL on clean clients. Empirical evaluation demonstrates ClipFL's efficacy across diverse datasets and noise levels, achieving accurate noisy client identification, superior performance, faster convergence, and reduced communication costs compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoliang Wang, Chen Zhao, Feng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-set domain generalization addresses a real-world challenge: training a model to generalize across unseen domains (domain generalization) while also detecting samples from unknown classes not encountered during training (open-set recognition). However, most existing approaches tackle these issues separately, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified framework for open-set domain generalization by introducing Feature-space Semantic Invariance (FSI). FSI maintains semantic consistency across different domains within the feature space, enabling more accurate detection of OOD instances in unseen domains. Additionally, we adopt a generative model to produce synthetic data with novel domain styles or class labels, enhancing model robustness. Initial experiments show that our method improves AUROC by 9.1% to 18.9% on ColoredMNIST, while also significantly increasing in-distribution classification accuracy.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07398">Beyond Keywords: A Context-based Hybrid Approach to Mining Ethical Concern-related App Reviews</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Sorathiya, Gouri Ginde</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing proliferation of mobile applications in our everyday experiences, the concerns surrounding ethics have surged significantly. Users generally communicate their feedback, report issues, and suggest new functionalities in application (app) reviews, frequently emphasizing safety, privacy, and accountability concerns. Incorporating these reviews is essential to developing successful products. However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use domain-specific language and are expressed using a more varied vocabulary. Thus making automated ethical concern-related app review extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort.
  This study proposes a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approach that combines Natural Language Inference (NLI), which provides a deep comprehension of language nuances, and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale. Utilizing 43,647 app reviews from the mental health domain, the proposed methodology 1) Evaluates four NLI models to extract potential privacy reviews and compares the results of domain-specific privacy hypotheses with generic privacy hypotheses; 2) Evaluates four LLMs for classifying app reviews to privacy concerns; and 3) Uses the best NLI and LLM models further to extract new privacy reviews from the dataset. Results show that the DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli NLI model with domain-specific hypotheses yields the best performance, and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct LLM performs best in the classification of app reviews. Then, using NLI+LLM, an additional 1,008 new privacy-related reviews were extracted that were not identified through the keyword-based approach in previous research, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Minder, Kevin Du, Niklas Stoehr, Giovanni Monea, Chris Wendler, Robert West, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a question (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task, instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism that controls this behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Rizki Oktavian, Anirudh Tunga, Jonathan Nistor, James Tusar, J. Thomas Gruenwald, Yunlin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the challenges in operating nuclear power plants is to decide the amount of fuel needed in a cycle. Large-scale nuclear power plants are designed to operate at base load, meaning that they are expected to always operate at full power. Economically, a nuclear power plant should burn enough fuel to maintain criticality until the end of a cycle (EOC). If the reactor goes subcritical before the end of a cycle, it may result in early coastdown as the fuel in the core is already depleted. On contrary, if the reactor still has significant excess reactivity by the end of a cycle, the remaining fuels will remain unused. In both cases, the plant may lose a significant amount of money. This work proposes an innovative method based on a data-driven deep learning model to estimate the excess criticality of a boiling water reactor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asmit Nayak, Shirley Zhang, Yash Wani, Rishabh Khandelwal, Kassem Fawaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Deceptive patterns (DPs) in digital interfaces manipulate users into making unintended decisions, exploiting cognitive biases and psychological vulnerabilities. These patterns have become ubiquitous across various digital platforms. While efforts to mitigate DPs have emerged from legal and technical perspectives, a significant gap in usable solutions that empower users to identify and make informed decisions about DPs in real-time remains. In this work, we introduce AutoBot, an automated, deceptive pattern detector that analyzes websites' visual appearances using machine learning techniques to identify and notify users of DPs in real-time. AutoBot employs a two-staged pipeline that processes website screenshots, identifying interactable elements and extracting textual features without relying on HTML structure. By leveraging a custom language model, AutoBot understands the context surrounding these elements to determine the presence of deceptive patterns. We implement AutoBot as a lightweight Chrome browser extension that performs all analyses locally, minimizing latency and preserving user privacy. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in enhancing users' ability to navigate digital environments safely while providing a valuable tool for regulators to assess and enforce compliance with DP regulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Agarwal, Maria A. Rodriguez, Rajkumar Buyya</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's Function-as-a-Service offerings, a programmer is usually responsible for configuring function memory for its successful execution, which allocates proportional function resources such as CPU and network. However, right-sizing the function memory force developers to speculate performance and make ad-hoc configuration decisions. Recent research has highlighted that a function's input characteristics, such as input size, type and number of inputs, significantly impact its resource demand, run-time performance and costs with fluctuating workloads. This correlation further makes memory configuration a non-trivial task. On that account, an input-aware function memory allocator not only improves developer productivity by completely hiding resource-related decisions but also drives an opportunity to reduce resource wastage and offer a finer-grained cost-optimised pricing scheme. Therefore, we present MemFigLess, a serverless solution that estimates the memory requirement of a serverless function with input-awareness. The framework executes function profiling in an offline stage and trains a multi-output Random Forest Regression model on the collected metrics to invoke input-aware optimal configurations. We evaluate our work with the state-of-the-art approaches on AWS Lambda service to find that MemFigLess is able to capture the input-aware resource relationships and allocate upto 82% less resources and save up to 87% run-time costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyoungmin Kim, Kijae Hong, Caglar Gulcehre, Anastasia Ailamaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the demands and challenges in scalable LLM inference systems, affecting deployment and development processes. On the deployment side, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis on the conditions under which a particular scheduler performs better or worse, with performance varying substantially across different schedulers, hardware, models, and workloads. Manually testing each configuration on GPUs can be prohibitively expensive. On the development side, unpredictable performance and unknown upper limits can lead to inconclusive trial-and-error processes, consuming resources on ideas that end up ineffective. To address these challenges, we introduce INFERMAX, an analytical framework that uses inference cost models to compare various schedulers, including an optimal scheduler formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to establish an upper bound on performance. Our framework offers in-depth analysis and raises essential questions, challenging assumptions and exploring opportunities for more efficient scheduling. Notably, our findings indicate that preempting requests can reduce GPU costs by 30% compared to avoiding preemptions at all. We believe our methods and insights will facilitate the cost-effective deployment and development of scalable, efficient inference systems and pave the way for cost-based scheduling.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we research user preferences to see a chart, table, or text given a question asked by the user. This enables us to understand when it is best to show a chart, table, or text to the user for the specific question. For this, we conduct a user study where users are shown a question and asked what they would prefer to see and used the data to establish that a user's personal traits does influence the data outputs that they prefer. Understanding how user characteristics impact a user's preferences is critical to creating data tools with a better user experience. Additionally, we investigate to what degree an LLM can be used to replicate a user's preference with and without user preference data. Overall, these findings have significant implications pertaining to the development of data tools and the replication of human preferences using LLMs. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential use of LLMs to replicate user preference data which has major implications for future user modeling and personalization research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The safe and reliable operation of complex electromechanical systems in nuclear power plants is crucial for the safe production of nuclear power plants and their nuclear power unit. Therefore, accurate and timely fault diagnosis of nuclear power systems is of great significance for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants. The existing fault diagnosis methods mainly target a single device or subsystem, making it difficult to analyze the inherent connections and mutual effects between different types of faults at the entire unit level. This article uses the AP1000 full-scale simulator to simulate the important mechanical component failures of some key systems in the primary and secondary circuits of nuclear power units, and constructs a fault dataset. Meanwhile, a hierarchical multi granularity classification fault diagnosis model based on the EfficientNet large model is proposed, aiming to achieve hierarchical classification of nuclear power faults. The results indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis model can effectively classify faults in different circuits and system components of nuclear power units into hierarchical categories. However, the fault dataset in this study was obtained from a simulator, which may introduce additional information due to parameter redundancy, thereby affecting the diagnostic performance of the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications including generation of code snippets, but often struggle with generating code for complex Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Although existing LLM single-agent based systems give varying performance depending on the task complexity, they purely rely on larger and expensive models such as GPT-4. Our investigation reveals that no-cost and low-cost models such as Gemini-Pro, Mixtral and CodeLlama perform far worse than GPT-4 in a single-agent setting. With the motivation of developing a cost-efficient LLM based solution for solving ML tasks, we propose an LLM Multi-Agent based system which leverages combination of experts using profiling, efficient retrieval of past observations, LLM cascades, and ask-the-expert calls. Through empirical analysis on ML engineering tasks in the MLAgentBench benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, using no-cost models, namely Gemini as the base LLM, paired with GPT-4 in cascade and expert to serve occasional ask-the-expert calls for planning. With 94.2\% reduction in the cost (from \$0.931 per run cost averaged over all tasks for GPT-4 single agent system to \$0.054), our system is able to yield better average success rate of 32.95\% as compared to GPT-4 single-agent system yielding 22.72\% success rate averaged over all the tasks of MLAgentBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent evaluations of LLMs on coreference resolution have revealed that traditional output formats and evaluation metrics do not fully capture the models' referential understanding. To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.</p>

Fuzzy Negative Sampling (FNS) systematically selects high-quality negative edges based on fuzzy similarities, improving training efficiency. FGAT layer incorporates fuzzy rough set principles, enabling robust and discriminative node representations. Experiments on two research collaboration networks demonstrate FGAT's superior link prediction accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by leveraging the power of fuzzy rough sets for effective negative sampling and node feature learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce \emph{Learned Augmented Residual Layer} (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using \laurel can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves $60\%$ of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding $0.003\%$ more parameters, and matches it while adding $2.6\times$ fewer parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Hu, Xiao Wang, Lirong Wu, Huatian Zhang, Stan Z. Li, Sheng Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets. We have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting and MuJoCo imputation tasks, significantly enhanced by our innovative $t$ power sampling method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Sayan Bandyapadhyay, Ameeta Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization of user-generated content remains a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods often fail to ensure equitable representation across different social groups, leading to biased outputs. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods for fair extractive summarization: FairExtract, a clustering-based approach, and FairGPT, which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints. We evaluate these methods using Divsumm summarization dataset of White-aligned, Hispanic, and African-American dialect tweets and compare them against relevant baselines. The results obtained using a comprehensive set of summarization quality metrics such as SUPERT, BLANC, SummaQA, BARTScore, and UniEval, as well as a fairness metric F, demonstrate that FairExtract and FairGPT achieve superior fairness while maintaining competitive summarization quality. Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework, offering a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between these objectives. This work highlights the importance of fairness in summarization and sets a benchmark for future research in fairness-aware NLP models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammed Fatih Bulut, Yingqi Liu, Naveed Ahmad, Maximilian Turner, Sami Ait Ouahmane, Cameron Andrews, Lloyd Greenwald</p>
<p>Abstract: Large and Small Language Models (LMs) are typically pretrained using extensive volumes of text, which are sourced from publicly accessible platforms such as Wikipedia, Book Corpus, or through web scraping. These models, due to their exposure to a wide range of language data, exhibit impressive generalization capabilities and can perform a multitude of tasks simultaneously. However, they often fall short when it comes to domain-specific tasks due to their broad training data. This paper introduces SecEncoder, a specialized small language model that is pretrained using security logs. SecEncoder is designed to address the domain-specific limitations of general LMs by focusing on the unique language and patterns found in security logs. Experimental results indicate that SecEncoder outperforms other LMs, such as BERTlarge, DeBERTa-v3-large and OpenAI's Embedding (textembedding-ada-002) models, which are pretrained mainly on natural language, across various tasks. Furthermore, although SecEncoder is primarily pretrained on log data, it outperforms models pretrained on natural language for a range of tasks beyond log analysis, such as incident prioritization and threat intelligence document retrieval. This suggests that domain specific pretraining with logs can significantly enhance the performance of LMs in security. These findings pave the way for future research into security-specific LMs and their potential applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minda Li, Bhaskar Krishnamachari</p>
<p>Abstract: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) promise to revolutionize software development by automatically generating code from program specifications. We assess the performance of ChatGPT's GPT-3.5-turbo model on LeetCode, a popular platform with algorithmic coding challenges for technical interview practice, across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. We test three main hypotheses. First, ChatGPT solves fewer problems as difficulty rises (Hypothesis 1). Second, prompt engineering improves ChatGPT's performance, with greater gains on easier problems and diminishing returns on harder ones (Hypothesis 2). Third, ChatGPT performs better in popular languages like Python, Java, and C++ than in less common ones like Elixir, Erlang, and Racket (Hypothesis 3). To investigate these hypotheses, we conduct automated experiments using Python scripts to generate prompts that instruct ChatGPT to create Python solutions. These solutions are stored and manually submitted on LeetCode to check their correctness. For Hypothesis 1, results show the GPT-3.5-turbo model successfully solves 92% of easy, 79% of medium, and 51% of hard problems. For Hypothesis 2, prompt engineering yields improvements: 14-29% for Chain of Thought Prompting, 38-60% by providing failed test cases in a second feedback prompt, and 33-58% by switching to GPT-4. From a random subset of problems ChatGPT solved in Python, it also solved 78% in Java, 50% in C++, and none in Elixir, Erlang, or Racket. These findings generally validate all three hypotheses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Model stealing, where a learner tries to recover an unknown model via carefully chosen queries, is a critical problem in machine learning, as it threatens the security of proprietary models and the privacy of data they are trained on. In recent years, there has been particular interest in stealing large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we aim to build a theoretical understanding of stealing language models by studying a simple and mathematically tractable setting. We study model stealing for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and more generally low-rank language models.
  We assume that the learner works in the conditional query model, introduced by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang. Our main result is an efficient algorithm in the conditional query model, for learning any low-rank distribution. In other words, our algorithm succeeds at stealing any language model whose output distribution is low-rank. This improves upon the previous result by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang, which also requires the unknown distribution to have high "fidelity", a property that holds only in restricted cases. There are two key insights behind our algorithm: First, we represent the conditional distributions at each timestep by constructing barycentric spanners among a collection of vectors of exponentially large dimension. Second, for sampling from our representation, we iteratively solve a sequence of convex optimization problems that involve projection in relative entropy to prevent compounding of errors over the length of the sequence. This is an interesting example where, at least theoretically, allowing a machine learning model to solve more complex problems at inference time can lead to drastic improvements in its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YeongHyeon Park, Myung Jin Kim, Hyeong Seok Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: A pre-trained visual-language model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), successfully accomplishes various downstream tasks with text prompts, such as finding images or localizing regions within the image. Despite CLIP's strong multi-modal data capabilities, it remains limited in specialized environments, such as medical applications. For this purpose, many CLIP variants-i.e., BioMedCLIP, and MedCLIP-SAMv2-have emerged, but false positives related to normal regions persist. Thus, we aim to present a simple yet important goal of reducing false positives in medical anomaly detection. We introduce a Contrastive LAnguage Prompting (CLAP) method that leverages both positive and negative text prompts. This straightforward approach identifies potential lesion regions by visual attention to the positive prompts in the given image. To reduce false positives, we attenuate attention on normal regions using negative prompts. Extensive experiments with the BMAD dataset, including six biomedical benchmarks, demonstrate that CLAP method enhances anomaly detection performance. Our future plans include developing an automated fine prompting method for more practical usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiejin Chen, Kaishen Wang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking methods, which induce Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to output harmful responses, raise significant safety concerns. Among these methods, gradient-based approaches, which use gradients to generate malicious prompts, have been widely studied due to their high success rates in white-box settings, where full access to the model is available. However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques. Notably, Zer0-Jack achieves a 95\% attack success rate on MiniGPT-4 with the Harmful Behaviors Multi-modal Dataset on a black-box setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, we show that Zer0-Jack can directly attack commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o. Codes are provided in the supplement.</p>

The research employs advanced text mining techniques, including sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa-Large model and topic modeling with LDA. Empirical findings underscore the significant advantage of incorporating textual data, with the PSO-LSTM model outperforming benchmark models such as SVM, SVR, ARIMA, and GARCH. Ablation experiments reveal the contribution of each textual data category to the overall forecasting performance. The study highlights the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in finance and paves the way for future research in real-time forecasting and the integration of alternative data sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Ye, Zhaorui Tan, Yijie Hu, Xi Yang, Guangliang Cheng, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection under the one-class classification setting poses a significant challenge, as it involves accurately conceptualizing "normal" derived exclusively from a single category to discern anomalies from normal data variations. Capturing the intrinsic correlation among attributes within normal samples presents one promising method for learning the concept. To do so, the most recent effort relies on a learnable mask strategy with a reconstruction task. However, this wisdom may suffer from the risk of producing uniform masks, i.e., essentially nothing is masked, leading to less effective correlation learning. To address this issue, we presume that attributes related to others in normal samples can be divided into two non-overlapping and correlated subsets, defined as CorrSets, to capture the intrinsic correlation effectively. Accordingly, we introduce an innovative method that disentangles CorrSets from normal tabular data. To our knowledge, this is a pioneering effort to apply the concept of disentanglement for one-class anomaly detection on tabular data. Extensive experiments on 20 tabular datasets show that our method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and leads to an average performance improvement of 6.1% on AUC-PR and 2.1% on AUC-ROC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alhassan S. Yasin, Prabdeep S. Gill</p>
<p>Abstract: The inherent volatility and dynamic fluctuations within the financial stock market underscore the necessity for investors to employ a comprehensive and reliable approach that integrates risk management strategies, market trends, and the movement trends of individual securities. By evaluating specific data, investors can make more informed decisions. However, the current body of literature lacks substantial evidence supporting the practical efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, as many models have only demonstrated success in back testing using historical data. This highlights the urgent need for a more advanced methodology capable of addressing these challenges. There is a significant disconnect in the effective utilization of financial indicators to better understand the potential market trends of individual securities. The disclosure of successful trading strategies is often restricted within financial markets, resulting in a scarcity of widely documented and published strategies leveraging RL. Furthermore, current research frequently overlooks the identification of financial indicators correlated with various market trends and their potential advantages.
  This research endeavors to address these complexities by enhancing the ability of RL agents to effectively differentiate between positive and negative buy/sell actions using financial indicators. While we do not address all concerns, this paper provides deeper insights and commentary on the utilization of technical indicators and their benefits within reinforcement learning. This work establishes a foundational framework for further exploration and investigation of more complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoma Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, recommendation algorithms have been designed for service developers. But recently, a new paradigm called user-side recommender systems has been proposed. User-side recommender systems are built and used by end users, in sharp contrast to traditional provider-side recommender systems. Even if the official recommender system offered by the provider is not fair, end users can create and enjoy their own user-side recommender systems by themselves. Although the concept of user-side recommender systems is attractive, the problem is they require tremendous communication costs between the user and the official system. Even the most efficient user-side recommender systems require about 5 times more costs than provider-side recommender systems. Such high costs hinder the adoption of user-side recommender systems. In this paper, we propose overhead-free user-side recommender systems, RecCycle, which realizes user-side recommender systems without any communication overhead. The main idea of RecCycle is to recycle past recommendation results offered by the provider's recommender systems. The ingredients of RecCycle can be retrieved ``for free,'' and it greatly reduces the cost of user-side recommendations. In the experiments, we confirm that RecCycle performs as well as state-of-the-art user-side recommendation algorithms while RecCycle reduces costs significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the post-training of large language models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach to achieve generation aligned with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for policy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model. The objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages mode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that minimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference distribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for control over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's sharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our experiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks, demonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks. Moreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to the loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for wide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many open-ended conversations (e.g., tutoring lessons or business meetings) revolve around pre-defined reference materials, like worksheets or meeting bullets. To provide a framework for studying such conversation structure, we introduce Problem-Oriented Segmentation & Retrieval (POSR), the task of jointly breaking down conversations into segments and linking each segment to the relevant reference item. As a case study, we apply POSR to education where effectively structuring lessons around problems is critical yet difficult. We present LessonLink, the first dataset of real-world tutoring lessons, featuring 3,500 segments, spanning 24,300 minutes of instruction and linked to 116 SAT math problems. We define and evaluate several joint and independent approaches for POSR, including segmentation (e.g., TextTiling), retrieval (e.g., ColBERT), and large language models (LLMs) methods. Our results highlight that modeling POSR as one joint task is essential: POSR methods outperform independent segmentation and retrieval pipelines by up to +76% on joint metrics and surpass traditional segmentation methods by up to +78% on segmentation metrics. We demonstrate POSR's practical impact on downstream education applications, deriving new insights on the language and time use in real-world lesson structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a tighter circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the arithmetic problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical framework not only establishes tighter complexity bounds but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asghar Asgharian-Sardroud, Mohammad Hossein Izanlou, Amin Jabbari, Sepehr Mahmoodian Hamedani</p>
<p>Abstract: Network function virtualization enables network operators to implement new services through a process called service function chain mapping. The concept of Service Function Chain (SFC) is introduced to provide complex services, which is an ordered set of Network Functions (NF). The network functions of an SFC can be decomposed in several ways into some Virtual Network Functions (VNF). Additionally, the decomposed NFs can be placed (mapped) as VNFs on different machines on the underlying physical infrastructure. Selecting good decompositions and good placements among the possible options greatly affects both costs and service quality metrics. Previous research has addressed NF decomposition and VNF placement as separate problems. However, in this paper, we address both NF decomposition and VNF placement simultaneously as a single problem. Since finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, we have employed heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. Specifically, we have introduced a multiobjective decomposition and mapping VNFs (MODMVNF) method based on the non-dominated sorting genetic multi-objective algorithm (NSGAII) to solve the problem. The goal is to find near-optimal decomposition and mapping on the physical network at the same time to minimize the mapping cost and communication latency of SFC. The comparison of the results of the proposed method with the results obtained by solving ILP formulation of the problem as well as the results obtained from the multi-objective particle swarm algorithm shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of cost and communication latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Yida Xu, Yunya Song, Xian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical rationales play a pivotal role in accurate disease diagnosis; however, many models predominantly use discriminative methods and overlook the importance of generating supportive rationales. Rationale distillation is a process that transfers knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to smaller language models (SLMs), thereby enhancing the latter's ability to break down complex tasks. Despite its benefits, rationale distillation alone is inadequate for addressing domain knowledge limitations in tasks requiring specialized expertise, such as disease diagnosis. Effectively embedding domain knowledge in SLMs poses a significant challenge. While current LLMs are primarily geared toward processing textual data, multimodal LLMs that incorporate time series data, especially electronic health records (EHRs), are still evolving. To tackle these limitations, we introduce ClinRaGen, an SLM optimized for multimodal rationale generation in disease diagnosis. ClinRaGen incorporates a unique knowledge-augmented attention mechanism to merge domain knowledge with time series EHR data, utilizing a stepwise rationale distillation strategy to produce both textual and time series-based clinical rationales. Our evaluations show that ClinRaGen markedly improves the SLM's capability to interpret multimodal EHR data and generate accurate clinical rationales, supporting more reliable disease diagnosis, advancing LLM applications in healthcare, and narrowing the performance divide between LLMs and SLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning has been successfully applied in diverse fields, and its impact on deepfake detection is no exception. Deepfakes are fake yet realistic synthetic content that can be used deceitfully for political impersonation, phishing, slandering, or spreading misinformation. Despite extensive research on unimodal deepfake detection, identifying complex deepfakes through joint analysis of audio and visual streams remains relatively unexplored. To fill this gap, this survey first provides an overview of audiovisual deepfake generation techniques, applications, and their consequences, and then provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods that combine audio and visual modalities to enhance detection accuracy, summarizing and critically analyzing their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss existing open source datasets for a deeper understanding, which can contribute to the research community and provide necessary information to beginners who want to analyze deep learning-based audiovisual methods for video forensics. By bridging the gap between unimodal and multimodal approaches, this paper aims to improve the effectiveness of deepfake detection strategies and guide future research in cybersecurity and media integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudara Kularathne, Janitha Prathapa, Prarththanan Sothyrajah, Salomi Arasaratnam, Sithira Ambepitiya, Thanveer Ahamed, Dinuka Wijesundara</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents an innovative AI-driven tool for diagnosing Peyronie's Disease (PD), a condition that affects between 0.3% and 13.1% of men worldwide. Our method uses key point detection on both images and videos to measure penile curvature angles, utilizing advanced computer vision techniques. This tool has demonstrated high accuracy in identifying anatomical landmarks, validated against conventional goniometer measurements. Traditional PD diagnosis often involves subjective and invasive methods, which can lead to patient discomfort and inaccuracies. Our approach offers a precise, reliable, and non-invasive diagnostic tool to address these drawbacks. The model distinguishes between PD and normal anatomical changes with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 100%. This advancement represents a significant improvement in urological diagnostics, greatly enhancing the efficacy and convenience of PD assessment for healthcare providers and patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deng Xu, Chao Zhang, Zechao Li, Chunlin Chen, Huaxiong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor-based multi-view clustering has recently received significant attention due to its exceptional ability to explore cross-view high-order correlations. However, most existing methods still encounter some limitations. (1) Most of them explore the correlations among different affinity matrices, making them unscalable to large-scale data. (2) Although some methods address it by introducing bipartite graphs, they may result in sub-optimal solutions caused by an unstable anchor selection process. (3) They generally ignore the negative impact of latent semantic-unrelated information in each view. To tackle these issues, we propose a new approach termed fast Disentangled Slim Tensor Learning (DSTL) for multi-view clustering . Instead of focusing on the multi-view graph structures, DSTL directly explores the high-order correlations among multi-view latent semantic representations based on matrix factorization. To alleviate the negative influence of feature redundancy, inspired by robust PCA, DSTL disentangles the latent low-dimensional representation into a semantic-unrelated part and a semantic-related part for each view. Subsequently, two slim tensors are constructed with tensor-based regularization. To further enhance the quality of feature disentanglement, the semantic-related representations are aligned across views through a consensus alignment indicator. Our proposed model is computationally efficient and can be solved effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of DSTL over state-of-the-art approaches. The code of DSTL is available at https://github.com/dengxu-nju/DSTL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Rath, Subham Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed microgrids are conventionally dependent on communication networks to achieve secondary control objectives. This dependence makes them vulnerable to stealth data integrity attacks (DIAs) where adversaries may perform manipulations via infected transmitters and repeaters to jeopardize stability. This paper presents a physics-guided, supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based framework that identifies communication-level cyberattacks in microgrids by analyzing whether incoming measurements will cause abnormal behavior of the secondary control layer. If abnormalities are detected, an iteration through possible spanning tree graph topologies that can be used to fulfill secondary control objectives is done. Then, a communication network topology that would not create secondary control abnormalities is identified and enforced for maximum stability. By altering the communication graph topology, the framework eliminates the dependence of the secondary control layer on inputs from compromised cyber devices helping it achieve resilience without instability. Several case studies are provided showcasing the robustness of the framework against False Data Injections and repeater-level Man-in-the-Middle attacks. To understand practical feasibility, robustness is also verified against larger microgrid sizes and in the presence of varying noise levels. Our findings indicate that performance can be affected when attempting scalability in the presence of noise. However, the framework operates robustly in low-noise settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilun Zhang, Haozhan Shen, Tiancheng Zhao, Yuhao Wang, Bin Chen, Yuxiang Cai, Yongheng Shang, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra High Resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) (e.g. 100,000 $\times$ 100,000 pixels or more) poses a significant challenge for current Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models (RSMLLMs). If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wu Chen, Qiuping Jiang, Wei Zhou, Feng Shao, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, as an emerging visual media format, is increasingly favored by consumers as it can provide more realistic visual information than two-dimensional (2D) data. Similar to 2D plane images and videos, point clouds inevitably suffer from quality degradation and information loss through multimedia communication systems. Therefore, automatic point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is of critical importance. In this work, we propose a novel no-reference PCQA method by using a graph convolutional network (GCN) to characterize the mutual dependencies of multi-view 2D projected image contents. The proposed GCN-based PCQA (GC-PCQA) method contains three modules, i.e., multi-view projection, graph construction, and GCN-based quality prediction. First, multi-view projection is performed on the test point cloud to obtain a set of horizontally and vertically projected images. Then, a perception-consistent graph is constructed based on the spatial relations among different projected images. Finally, reasoning on the constructed graph is performed by GCN to characterize the mutual dependencies and interactions between different projected images, and aggregate feature information of multi-view projected images for final quality prediction. Experimental results on two publicly available benchmark databases show that our proposed GC-PCQA can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art quality assessment metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Qian, Jiaran Gao, Yaodan Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Hexin Liu, Leibny Paola Garcia, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech enhancement plays an essential role in various applications, and the integration of visual information has been demonstrated to bring substantial advantages. However, the majority of current research concentrates on the examination of facial and lip movements, which can be compromised or entirely inaccessible in scenarios where occlusions occur or when the camera view is distant. Whereas contextual visual cues from the surrounding environment have been overlooked: for example, when we see a dog bark, our brain has the innate ability to discern and filter out the barking noise. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, i.e. SAV-SE. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to use rich contextual information from synchronized video as auxiliary cues to indicate the type of noise, which eventually improves the speech enhancement performance. Specifically, we propose the VC-S$^2$E method, which incorporates the Conformer and Mamba modules for their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments are conducted on public MUSIC, AVSpeech and AudioSet datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of VC-S$^2$E over other competitive methods. We will make the source code publicly available. Project demo page: https://AVSEPage.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lawrence Francis, Blessed Guda, Ahmed Biyabani</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) traffic signal control (TSC), decisions on the signal timing are made based on the available information on vehicles at a road intersection. This forms the state representation for the RL environment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables or a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high dimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC. However, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional state representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with improvements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional representation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the large size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient models and explored model compression via pruning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexi Canesse, Mathieu Petitbois, Ludovic Denoyer, Sylvain Lamprier, R\'emy Portelas</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful alternative to imitation learning for behavior modeling in various domains, particularly in complex navigation tasks. An existing challenge with Offline RL is the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. how to mitigate incorrect policy updates due to errors in value estimates. Towards this, multiple works have demonstrated the advantage of hierarchical offline RL methods, which decouples high-level path planning from low-level path following. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical transformer-based approach leveraging a learned quantizer of the space. This quantization enables the training of a simpler zone-conditioned low-level policy and simplifies planning, which is reduced to discrete autoregressive prediction. Among other benefits, zone-level reasoning in planning enables explicit trajectory stitching rather than implicit stitching based on noisy value function estimates. By combining this transformer-based planner with recent advancements in offline RL, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in complex long-distance navigation environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weibo Zhao, Yubin Shi, Xinyu Lyu, Wanchen Sui, Shen Li, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization stands as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) serving, yet it poses significant challenges particularly in achieving effective low-bit quantization. The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world enterprise text-to-SQL workflows often involve complex cloud or local data across various database systems, multiple SQL queries in various dialects, and diverse operations from data transformation to analytics. We introduce Spider 2.0, an evaluation framework comprising 632 real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases. The databases in Spider 2.0 are sourced from real data applications, often containing over 1,000 columns and stored in local or cloud database systems such as BigQuery and Snowflake. We show that solving problems in Spider 2.0 frequently requires understanding and searching through database metadata, dialect documentation, and even project-level codebases. This challenge calls for models to interact with complex SQL workflow environments, process extremely long contexts, perform intricate reasoning, and generate multiple SQL queries with diverse operations, often exceeding 100 lines, which goes far beyond traditional text-to-SQL challenges. Our evaluations indicate that based on o1-preview, our code agent framework successfully solves only 17.0% of the tasks, compared with 91.2% on Spider 1.0 and 73.0% on BIRD. Our results on Spider 2.0 show that while language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in code generation -- especially in prior text-to-SQL benchmarks -- they require significant improvement in order to achieve adequate performance for real-world enterprise usage. Progress on Spider 2.0 represents crucial steps towards developing intelligent, autonomous, code agents for real-world enterprise settings.

<p>Abstract: Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this -- alongside a full copy of our implementation -- is publicly available at https://github.com/dylanashley/automatic-album-sequencing</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Liu, Jirui Qi, Paul He, Arianna Bisazza, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work finds that retrieval-augmented generation with large language models is prone to be influenced by the order of retrieved documents in the context. However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapidly increasing capabilities and adoption of code agents for AI-assisted coding, safety concerns, such as generating or executing risky code, have become significant barriers to the real-world deployment of these agents. To provide comprehensive and practical evaluations on the safety of code agents, we propose RedCode, a benchmark for risky code execution and generation: (1) RedCode-Exec provides challenging prompts that could lead to risky code execution, aiming to evaluate code agents' ability to recognize and handle unsafe code. We provide a total of 4,050 risky test cases in Python and Bash tasks with diverse input formats including code snippets and natural text. They covers 25 types of critical vulnerabilities spanning 8 domains (e.g., websites, file systems). We provide Docker environments and design corresponding evaluation metrics to assess their execution results. (2) RedCode-Gen provides 160 prompts with function signatures and docstrings as input to assess whether code agents will follow instructions to generate harmful code or software. Our empirical findings, derived from evaluating three agent frameworks based on 19 LLMs, provide insights into code agents' vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations on RedCode-Exec show that agents are more likely to reject executing risky operations on the operating system, but are less likely to reject executing technically buggy code, indicating high risks. Risky operations described in natural text lead to a lower rejection rate than those in code format. Additionally, evaluations on RedCode-Gen show that more capable base models and agents with stronger overall coding abilities, such as GPT4, tend to produce more sophisticated and effective harmful software. Our findings highlight the need for stringent safety evaluations for diverse code agents. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/RedCode.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned from labeled source domains to improve performance on the unlabeled target domains. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been dominant in previous UDA methods, recent research has shown promise in applying Vision Transformers (ViTs) to this task. In this study, we propose a novel Feature Fusion Transferability Aware Transformer (FFTAT) to enhance ViT performance in UDA tasks. Our method introduces two key innovations: First, we introduce a patch discriminator to evaluate the transferability of patches, generating a transferability matrix. We integrate this matrix into self-attention, directing the model to focus on transferable patches. Second, we propose a feature fusion technique to fuse embeddings in the latent space, enabling each embedding to incorporate information from all others, thereby improving generalization. These two components work in synergy to enhance feature representation learning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves UDA performance, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated images has intensified the need for robust content authentication methods. We present InvisMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for high-resolution AI-generated images. Our approach leverages advanced neural network architectures and training strategies to embed imperceptible yet highly robust watermarks. InvisMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in imperceptibility (PSNR$\sim$51, SSIM $\sim$ 0.998) while maintaining over 97\% bit accuracy across various image manipulations. Notably, we demonstrate the successful encoding of 256-bit watermarks, significantly expanding payload capacity while preserving image quality. This enables the embedding of UUIDs with error correction codes, achieving near-perfect decoding success rates even under challenging image distortions. We also address potential vulnerabilities against advanced attacks and propose mitigation strategies. By combining high imperceptibility, extended payload capacity, and resilience to manipulations, InvisMark provides a robust foundation for ensuring media provenance in an era of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kilian Pfeiffer, Mohamed Aboelenien Ahmed, Ramin Khalili, J\"org Henkel</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) through Transformer structures have dominated many machine learning tasks, especially text processing. However, these models require massive amounts of data for training and induce high resource requirements, particularly in terms of the large number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and the high amounts of memory needed. To fine-tune such a model in a parameter-efficient way, techniques like Adapter or LoRA have been developed. However, we observe that the application of LoRA, when used in federated learning (FL), while still being parameter-efficient, is memory and FLOP inefficient. Based on that observation, we develop a novel layer finetuning scheme that allows devices in cross-device FL to make use of pretrained neural networks (NNs) while adhering to given resource constraints. We show that our presented scheme outperforms the current state of the art when dealing with homogeneous or heterogeneous computation and memory constraints and is on par with LoRA regarding limited communication, thereby achieving significantly higher accuracies in FL training.</p>

In this paper, we propose a chain association-based adversarial attack against natural language processing systems, utilizing the comprehension gap between humans and machines. We first generate a chain association graph for Chinese characters based on the association paradigm for building search space of potential adversarial examples. Then, we introduce an discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm to search for the optimal adversarial examples. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that advanced natural language processing models and applications, including large language models, are vulnerable to our attack, while humans appear good at understanding the perturbed text. We also explore two methods, including adversarial training and associative graph-based recovery, to shield systems from chain association-based attack.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyin Yi, Jiacheng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples, which are inputs deliberately perturbed with imperceptible changes to induce model errors, have raised serious concerns for the reliability and security of deep neural networks (DNNs). While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in continuous data domains such as images, the discrete nature of text presents unique challenges. In this paper, we propose Irony-based Adversarial Examples (IAE), a method that transforms straightforward sentences into ironic ones to create adversarial text. This approach exploits the rhetorical device of irony, where the intended meaning is opposite to the literal interpretation, requiring a deeper understanding of context to detect. The IAE method is particularly challenging due to the need to accurately locate evaluation words, substitute them with appropriate collocations, and expand the text with suitable ironic elements while maintaining semantic coherence. Our research makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce IAE, a strategy for generating textual adversarial examples using irony. This method does not rely on pre-existing irony corpora, making it a versatile tool for creating adversarial text in various NLP tasks. (2) We demonstrate that the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models on sentiment analysis tasks significantly deteriorates when subjected to IAE attacks. This finding underscores the susceptibility of current NLP systems to adversarial manipulation through irony. (3) We compare the impact of IAE on human judgment versus NLP systems, revealing that humans are less susceptible to the effects of irony in text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Kluge Corr\^ea, Aniket Sen, Sophia Falk, Shiza Fatimah</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years. However, our current deep learning approach to language modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation. One of the side effects of this data-hungry paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and autonomy. This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation in Portuguese. In this work, we document the development of GigaVerbo, a concatenation of deduplicated Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers named Tucano. Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several Portuguese benchmarks. The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks used by the Portuguese NLP community has little to no correlation with the scaling of token ingestion during training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models. All derivatives of our study are openly released on GitHub and Hugging Face. See https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhu, Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxu Wang, Jiaqi Shang, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at discovering regular structures from limited samples and applying inferred rules to novel settings. We investigate whether modern generative models can similarly learn underlying rules from finite samples and perform reasoning through conditional sampling. Inspired by Raven's Progressive Matrices task, we designed GenRAVEN dataset, where each sample consists of three rows, and one of 40 relational rules governing the object position, number, or attributes applies to all rows. We trained generative models to learn the data distribution, where samples are encoded as integer arrays to focus on rule learning. We compared two generative model families: diffusion (EDM, DiT, SiT) and autoregressive models (GPT2, Mamba). We evaluated their ability to generate structurally consistent samples and perform panel completion via unconditional and conditional sampling. We found diffusion models excel at unconditional generation, producing more novel and consistent samples from scratch and memorizing less, but performing less well in panel completion, even with advanced conditional sampling methods. Conversely, autoregressive models excel at completing missing panels in a rule-consistent manner but generate less consistent samples unconditionally. We observe diverse data scaling behaviors: for both model families, rule learning emerges at a certain dataset size - around 1000s examples per rule. With more training data, diffusion models improve both their unconditional and conditional generation capabilities. However, for autoregressive models, while panel completion improves with more training data, unconditional generation consistency declines. Our findings highlight complementary capabilities and limitations of diffusion and autoregressive models in rule learning and reasoning tasks, suggesting avenues for further research into their mechanisms and potential for human-like reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current interactive segmentation approaches, inspired by the success of META's Segment Anything model, have achieved notable advancements, however, they come with substantial limitations that hinder their practical application in real clinical scenarios. These include unrealistic human interaction requirements, such as slice-by-slice operations for 2D models on 3D data, a lack of iterative refinement, and insufficient evaluation experiments. These shortcomings prevent accurate assessment of model performance and lead to inconsistent outcomes across studies. IntRaBench overcomes these challenges by offering a comprehensive and reproducible framework for evaluating interactive segmentation methods in realistic, clinically relevant scenarios. It includes diverse datasets, target structures, and segmentation models, and provides a flexible codebase that allows seamless integration of new models and prompting strategies. Additionally, we introduce advanced techniques to minimize clinician interaction, ensuring fair comparisons between 2D and 3D models. By open-sourcing IntRaBench, we invite the research community to integrate their models and prompting techniques, ensuring continuous and transparent evaluation of interactive segmentation models in 3D medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Mao, Qi Wang, Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from the extrapolation error and value overestimation. From a generalization perspective, this issue can be attributed to the over-generalization of value functions or policies towards out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Significant efforts have been devoted to mitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches have further succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mild generalization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve performance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalization in offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mild action generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The former refers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximize the Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still be propagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this, the latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagation without impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMG guarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle generalization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still control value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the performance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance across Gym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefiting from its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamless transition from offline to online learning and attains strong online fine-tuning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxi Zhang, Yueliang Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) provides highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) medical images but is costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in intraoperative settings (Organization et al. 2011). Recent advancements have explored reconstructing 3D chest volumes from sparse 2D X-rays, such as single-view or orthogonal double-view images. However, current models tend to process 2D images in a planar manner, prioritizing visual realism over structural accuracy. In this work, we introduce DuoLift Generative Adversarial Networks (DuoLift-GAN), a novel architecture with dual branches that independently elevate 2D images and their features into 3D representations. These 3D outputs are merged into a unified 3D feature map and decoded into a complete 3D chest volume, enabling richer 3D information capture. We also present a masked loss function that directs reconstruction towards critical anatomical regions, improving structural accuracy and visual quality. This paper demonstrates that DuoLift-GAN significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy while achieving superior visual realism compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present JanusFlow, a powerful framework that unifies image understanding and generation in a single model. JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmut S. Gokmen, Cody Bumgardner, Caner Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the most common cause of mortality in the world. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is key for risk assessment to prevent coronary disease. Previous studies on risk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily use approaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-built models. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CT scans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasing performance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend this approach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotated data in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC area annotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO model is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels, aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight key characteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification by distinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not, performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fed specifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by the DINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improves CAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase in CAC scoring accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Buffelli, Jamie McGowan, Wangkun Xu, Alexandru Cioba, Da-shan Shiu, Guillaume Hennequin, Alberto Bernacchia</p>
<p>Abstract: Second-order optimization has been shown to accelerate the training of deep neural networks in many applications, often yielding faster progress per iteration on the training loss compared to first-order optimizers.However, the generalization properties of second-order methods are still being debated. Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the tractable settings of heavily simplified model classes -- thus, the relevance of existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear. Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are significantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates in practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour arises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or instead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\ Kronecker) approximations used or any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show for the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable form in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently expressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit this novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the GN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch training setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the \emph{training} loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each mini-batchatch without producing the features that would support generalization to other mini-batches. We show that our experiments run in the ``lazy'' regime, in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes very little during the course of training. This behaviour is associated with having no significant changes in neural representations, explaining the lack of generalization.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990">Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Hofmann, Leonie Weissweiler, David Mortensen, Hinrich Sch\"utze, Janet Pierrehumbert</p>
<p>Abstract: What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be formalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of regularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Tint, Som Sagar, Aditya Taparia, Kelly Raines, Bimsara Pathiraja, Caleb Liu, Ransalu Senanayake</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain dimensions, their ability to express implicit language cues that human use for effective communication remains unclear. This paper presents ExpressivityArena, a Python library for measuring the implicit communication abilities of LLMs. We provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate expressivity of arbitrary LLMs and explore its practical implications. To this end, we refine the definition and measurements of ``expressivity,'' and use our framework in a set of small experiments. These experiments test LLMs in creative and logical tasks such as poetry, coding, and emotion-based responses. They are then evaluated by an automated grader, through ExpressivityArena, which we verify to be the most pragmatic for testing expressivity. Building on these experiments, we deepen our understanding of the expressivity of LLMs by assessing their ability to remain expressive in conversations. Our findings indicate that LLMs are capable of generating and understanding expressive content, however, with some limitations. These insights will inform the future development and deployment of expressive LLMs. We provide the code for ExpressivityArena alongside our paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) provide significant early indicators for diagnosis. While models for speech-based PD detection have shown strong performance, their interpretability remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several explainability methods to identify PD-specific speech features, aiming to support the development of accurate, interpretable models for clinical decision-making in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Our methodology involves (i) obtaining attributions and saliency maps using mainstream interpretability techniques, (ii) quantitatively evaluating the faithfulness of these maps and their combinations obtained via union and intersection through a range of established metrics, and (iii) assessing the information conveyed by the saliency maps for PD detection from an auxiliary classifier. Our results reveal that, while explanations are aligned with the classifier, they often fail to provide valuable information for domain experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Sanghi, Aliasghar Khani, Pradyumna Reddy, Arianna Rampini, Derek Cheung, Kamal Rahimi Malekshan, Kanika Madan, Hooman Shayani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale 3D generative models require substantial computational resources yet often fall short in capturing fine details and complex geometries at high resolutions. We attribute this limitation to the inefficiency of current representations, which lack the compactness required to model the generative models effectively. To address this, we introduce a novel approach called Wavelet Latent Diffusion, or WaLa, that encodes 3D shapes into wavelet-based, compact latent encodings. Specifically, we compress a $256^3$ signed distance field into a $12^3 \times 4$ latent grid, achieving an impressive 2427x compression ratio with minimal loss of detail. This high level of compression allows our method to efficiently train large-scale generative networks without increasing the inference time. Our models, both conditional and unconditional, contain approximately one billion parameters and successfully generate high-quality 3D shapes at $256^3$ resolution. Moreover, WaLa offers rapid inference, producing shapes within two to four seconds depending on the condition, despite the model's scale. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with significant improvements in generation quality, diversity, and computational efficiency. We open-source our code and, to the best of our knowledge, release the largest pretrained 3D generative models across different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucius E. J. Bynum, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation with controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for turning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a sequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM is a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural equations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional relationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these datasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating data, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal effect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing LLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: While 3D content generation has advanced significantly, existing methods still face challenges with input formats, latent space design, and output representations. This paper introduces a novel 3D generation framework that addresses these challenges, offering scalable, high-quality 3D generation with an interactive Point Cloud-structured Latent space. Our framework employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with multi-view posed RGB-D(epth)-N(ormal) renderings as input, using a unique latent space design that preserves 3D shape information, and incorporates a cascaded latent diffusion model for improved shape-texture disentanglement. The proposed method, GaussianAnything, supports multi-modal conditional 3D generation, allowing for point cloud, caption, and single/multi-view image inputs. Notably, the newly proposed latent space naturally enables geometry-texture disentanglement, thus allowing 3D-aware editing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teddy Ferdinan, Jan Koco\'n, Przemys{\l}aw Kazienko</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the main problem of self-learning LLM: the question of what to learn. We propose a self-learning LLM framework that enables an LLM to independently learn previously unknown knowledge through self-assessment of their own hallucinations. We introduce a concept called Point in the Unknown (PiU) to identify atomic knowledge unknown to a model, along with four methods for automatic PiUs identification, facilitating the creation of a self-learning loop that focuses exclusively on the absorption of currently unknown knowledge into the model. Additionally, we developed evaluation metrics to gauge an LLM's self-learning capability. Our experiments revealed that LLMs with at least 3B parameters that have undergone some instruction training would be able to perform self-learning well. We further proved the effectiveness of self-learning by comparing the performance of a model that has undergone self-learning to a model that has not. Our self-learning concept allows more efficient LLM updates and opens new perspectives for LLM knowledge exchange.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Priorelli, Ivilin Peev Stoianov</p>
<p>Abstract: By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maris F. L. Galesloot, Marnix Suilen, Thiago D. Sim\~ao, Steven Carr, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Ufuk Topcu, Nils Jansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust POMDPs extend classical POMDPs to handle model uncertainty. Specifically, robust POMDPs exhibit so-called uncertainty sets on the transition and observation models, effectively defining ranges of probabilities. Policies for robust POMDPs must be (1) memory-based to account for partial observability and (2) robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case instances from the uncertainty sets. To compute such robust memory-based policies, we propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting a pessimistic (non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this pessimistic POMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and use this evaluation in step (1) to select the next pessimistic POMDP. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC through a recurrent neural network by using supervision policies optimized for the pessimistic POMDP. The empirical evaluation in four benchmark environments showcases improved robustness against several baseline methods and competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this tutorial, we present a compact and holistic discussion of Deep Learning with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and supervised regression. While there are numerous books and articles on the individual topics we cover, comprehensive and detailed tutorials that address Deep Learning from a foundational yet rigorous and accessible perspective are rare. Most resources on CNNs are either too advanced, focusing on cutting-edge architectures, or too narrow, addressing only specific applications like image classification.This tutorial not only summarizes the most relevant concepts but also provides an in-depth exploration of each, offering a complete yet agile set of ideas. Moreover, we highlight the powerful synergy between learning theory, statistic, and machine learning, which together underpin the Deep Learning and CNN frameworks. We aim for this tutorial to serve as an optimal resource for students, professors, and anyone interested in understanding the foundations of Deep Learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazuo Yu, Haomiao Xiong, Lu Zhang, Haiwen Diao, Yunzhi Zhuge, Lanqing Hong, Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu, You He, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, existing methods rely heavily on extensive modal-specific pretraining and joint-modal tuning, leading to significant computational burdens when expanding to new modalities. In this paper, we propose PathWeave, a flexible and scalable framework with modal-Path sWitching and ExpAnsion abilities that enables MLLMs to continually EVolve on modalities for $\mathbb{X}$-modal reasoning. We leverage the concept of Continual Learning and develop an incremental training strategy atop pre-trained MLLMs, enabling their expansion to new modalities using uni-modal data, without executing joint-modal pretraining. In detail, a novel Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework is introduced, in which uni-modal and cross-modal adapters are seamlessly integrated to facilitate efficient modality alignment and collaboration. Additionally, an MoE-based gating module is applied between two types of adapters to further enhance the multimodal interaction. To investigate the proposed method, we establish a challenging benchmark called Continual Learning of Modality (MCL), which consists of high-quality QA data from five distinct modalities: image, video, audio, depth and point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AnA framework on learning plasticity and memory stability during continual learning. Furthermore, PathWeave performs comparably to state-of-the-art MLLMs while concurrently reducing parameter training burdens by 98.73%. Our code locates at https://github.com/JiazuoYu/PathWeave</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Doyle</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce "Method Actors" as a mental model for guiding LLM prompt engineering and prompt architecture. Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Ollie Liu, Lingyao Li, Alfonso Amayuelas, Julie Chen, Lucas Jiang, Mingyu Jin, Lizhou Fan, Fei Sun, William Wang, Xintong Wang, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees.
  To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself.
  Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Quan Loh, Xuewen Luo, Fan Ding, Hwa Hui Tew, Junn Yong Loo, Ze Yang Ding, Susilawati Susilawati, Chee Pin Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancements of sensor hardware, traffic infrastructure and deep learning architectures, trajectory prediction of vehicles has established a solid foundation in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyi Wang, Jianheng Liu, Bryan Lee, Zhihao Wu, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models (LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting instruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction datasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged as an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality instructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or stronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply adopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. In this paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensive experiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that larger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller models. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observe that existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response generators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models being fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named as Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response generators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR outperforms almost all baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhu, Thomas Lin, Vishal Anand, Matthew Calderwood, Eric Clausen-Brown, Gord Lueck, Wen-wai Yim, Cheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge in numerous real-world applications is to match an inquiry to the best document from a mutable and finite set of candidates. Existing industry solutions, especially latency-constrained services, often rely on similarity algorithms that sacrifice quality for speed. In this paper we introduce a generic semantic learning-to-rank framework, Self-training Semantic Cross-attention Ranking (sRank). This transformer-based framework uses linear pairwise loss with mutable training batch sizes and achieves quality gains and high efficiency, and has been applied effectively to show gains on two industry tasks at Microsoft over real-world large-scale data sets: Smart Reply (SR) and Ambient Clinical Intelligence (ACI). In Smart Reply, sRank assists live customers with technical support by selecting the best reply from predefined solutions based on consumer and support agent messages. It achieves 11.7% gain in offline top-one accuracy on the SR task over the previous system, and has enabled 38.7% time reduction in composing messages in telemetry recorded since its general release in January 2021. In the ACI task, sRank selects relevant historical physician templates that serve as guidance for a text summarization model to generate higher quality medical notes. It achieves 35.5% top-one accuracy gain, along with 46% relative ROUGE-L gain in generated medical notes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter, Levi H. S. Lelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Levin Tree Search (LTS) is a search algorithm that makes use of a policy (a probability distribution over actions) and comes with a theoretical guarantee on the number of expansions before reaching a goal node, depending on the quality of the policy. This guarantee can be used as a loss function, which we call the LTS loss, to optimize neural networks representing the policy (LTS+NN). In this work we show that the neural network can be substituted with parameterized context models originating from the online compression literature (LTS+CM). We show that the LTS loss is convex under this new model, which allows for using standard convex optimization tools, and obtain convergence guarantees to the optimal parameters in an online setting for a given set of solution trajectories -- guarantees that cannot be provided for neural networks. The new LTS+CM algorithm compares favorably against LTS+NN on several benchmarks: Sokoban (Boxoban), The Witness, and the 24-Sliding Tile puzzle (STP). The difference is particularly large on STP, where LTS+NN fails to solve most of the test instances while LTS+CM solves each test instance in a fraction of a second. Furthermore, we show that LTS+CM is able to learn a policy that solves the Rubik's cube in only a few hundred expansions, which considerably improves upon previous machine learning techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Liu, Wenshan Li, Tao Li, Beibei Li, Guangquan Xu, Pan Zhou, Wengang Ma, Hanyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Agarwal, Maria A. Rodriguez, Rajkumar Buyya</p>
<p>Abstract: FaaS introduces a lightweight, function-based cloud execution model that finds its relevance in a range of applications like IoT-edge data processing and anomaly detection. While cloud service providers offer a near-infinite function elasticity, these applications often experience fluctuating workloads and stricter performance constraints. A typical CSP strategy is to empirically determine and adjust desired function instances or resources, known as autoscaling, based on monitoring-based thresholds such as CPU or memory, to cope with demand and performance. However, threshold configuration either requires expert knowledge, historical data or a complete view of the environment, making autoscaling a performance bottleneck that lacks an adaptable solution. RL algorithms are proven to be beneficial in analysing complex cloud environments and result in an adaptable policy that maximizes the expected objectives. Most realistic cloud environments usually involve operational interference and have limited visibility, making them partially observable. A general solution to tackle observability in highly dynamic settings is to integrate Recurrent units with model-free RL algorithms and model a decision process as a POMDP. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate model-free Recurrent RL agents for function autoscaling and compare them against the model-free PPO algorithm. We explore the integration of a LSTM network with the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm to find that under our experimental and evaluation settings, recurrent policies were able to capture the environment parameters and show promising results for function autoscaling. We further compare a PPO-based autoscaling agent with commercially used threshold-based function autoscaling and posit that a LSTM-based autoscaling agent is able to improve throughput by 18%, function execution by 13% and account for 8.4% more function instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pasquale Balsebre, Weiming Huang, Gao Cong, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Foundation Models (PFMs) have ushered in a paradigm-shift in Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to learn general-purpose representations that can be readily employed in a wide range of downstream tasks. While PFMs have been successfully adopted in various fields such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, their capacity in handling geospatial data and answering urban questions remains limited. This can be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of geospatial data, which encompasses different data types, including points, segments and regions, as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial position, visual characteristics and textual annotations. The proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information initiatives, and the ever-increasing availability of open geospatial data sources, like OpenStreetMap, which is freely accessible globally, unveil a promising opportunity to bridge this gap. In this paper, we present CityFM, a self-supervised framework to train a foundation model within a selected geographical area of interest, such as a city. CityFM relies solely on open data from OSM, and produces multimodal representations of entities of different types, incorporating spatial, visual, and textual information. We analyse the entity representations generated using our foundation models from a qualitative perspective, and conduct quantitative experiments on road, building, and region-level downstream tasks. We compare its results to algorithms tailored specifically for the respective applications. In all the experiments, CityFM achieves performance superior to, or on par with, the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos E. Jimenez, John Yang, Alexander Wettig, Shunyu Yao, Kexin Pei, Ofir Press, Karthik Narasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have outpaced our ability to evaluate them effectively, but for their future development it is essential to study the frontier of their capabilities. We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of $2,294$ software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across $12$ popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-of-the-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere $1.96$% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azmine Toushik Wasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection and greater explainability. In this work, we represent speeches as nodes and connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. This study introduces a novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam. Our model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while providing valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliot Schumacher, Daniel Rosenthal, Dhruv Naik, Varun Nair, Luladay Price, Geoffrey Tso, Anitha Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in safety-critical applications such as healthcare, yet the ability to quantify performance has lagged. An example of this challenge is in evaluating a summary of the patient's medical record. A resulting summary can enable the provider to get a high-level overview of the patient's health status quickly. Yet, a summary that omits important facts about the patient's record can produce a misleading picture. This can lead to negative consequences on medical decision-making. We propose MED-OMIT as a metric to explore this challenge. We focus on using provider-patient history conversations to generate a subjective (a summary of the patient's history) as a case study. We begin by discretizing facts from the dialogue and identifying which are omitted from the subjective. To determine which facts are clinically relevant, we measure the importance of each fact to a simulated differential diagnosis. We compare MED-OMIT's performance to that of clinical experts and find broad agreement We use MED-OMIT to evaluate LLM performance on subjective generation and find some LLMs (gpt-4 and llama-3.1-405b) work well with little effort, while others (e.g. Llama 2) perform worse.</p>

This paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks for the purpose of multimodal deception detection. We use a dataset built by interviewing 104 subjects about two topics, with one truthful and one falsified response from each subject about each topic. In particular, we make three main contributions. First, we extract linguistic and physiological features from this data to train and construct the neural network models. Second, we propose a fused convolutional neural network model using both modalities in order to achieve an improved overall performance. Third, we compare our new approach with earlier methods designed for multimodal deception detection. We find that our system outperforms regular classification methods; our results indicate the feasibility of using neural networks for deception detection even in the presence of limited amounts of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgi Ganev, Emiliano De Cristofaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris Gill (Virginia Tech), Ali Anwar (University of Minnesota Twin Cities), Muhammad Ali Gulzar (Virginia Tech)</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost--FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML explainability approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training.
  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for the global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction. It then selectively picks a slice of the most crucial neurons in the global model and maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee-Jun Jung, Jaehyoung Jeong, Kangil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Symmetries of input and latent vectors have provided valuable insights for disentanglement learning in VAEs. However, only a few works were proposed as an unsupervised method, and even these works require known factor information in the training data. We propose a novel method, Composite Factor-Aligned Symmetry Learning (CFASL), which is integrated into VAEs for learning symmetry-based disentanglement in unsupervised learning without any knowledge of the dataset factor information. CFASL incorporates three novel features for learning symmetry-based disentanglement: 1) Injecting inductive bias to align latent vector dimensions to factor-aligned symmetries within an explicit learnable symmetry code-book 2) Learning a composite symmetry to express unknown factors change between two random samples by learning factor-aligned symmetries within the codebook 3) Inducing a group equivariant encoder and decoder in training VAEs with the two conditions. In addition, we propose an extended evaluation metric for multi-factor changes in comparison to disentanglement evaluation in VAEs. In quantitative and in-depth qualitative analysis, CFASL demonstrates a significant improvement of disentanglement in single-factor change, and multi-factor change conditions compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Chuanbo Hua, Jianpeng Yao, Hengbo Ma, Jinkyoo Park, Victoria Dax, Mykel J. Kochenderfer</p>
<p>Abstract: Social robot navigation can be helpful in various contexts of daily life but requires safe human-robot interactions and efficient trajectory planning. While modeling pairwise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, the ability to capture larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a systematic relational reasoning approach with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction and social robot navigation. In addition to the edges between pairs of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-wise reasoning in an unsupervised manner. Our approach infers dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs to capture the evolution of relations, which the trajectory predictor employs to generate future states. Meanwhile, we propose to regularize the sharpness and sparsity of the learned relations and the smoothness of the relation evolution, which proves to enhance training stability and model performance. The proposed approach is validated on synthetic crowd simulations and real-world benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the approach infers reasonable relations and achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. In addition, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for social robot navigation, which incorporates relational reasoning and trajectory prediction systematically. In a group-based crowd simulation, our method outperforms the strongest baseline by a significant margin in terms of safety, efficiency, and social compliance in dense, interactive scenarios. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with real-world robot experiments. The code and videos can be found at https://relational-reasoning-nav.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xirui Li, Ruochen Wang, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable to both manual and automated jailbreak attacks, which adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content. However, current methods for jailbreaking LLMs, which nest entire harmful prompts, are not effective at concealing malicious intent and can be easily identified and rejected by well-aligned LLMs. This paper discovers that decomposing a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively obscure its underlying malicious intent by presenting it in a fragmented, less detectable form, thereby addressing these limitations. We introduce an automatic prompt \textbf{D}ecomposition and \textbf{R}econstruction framework for jailbreak \textbf{Attack} (DrAttack). DrAttack includes three key components: (a) `Decomposition' of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b) `Reconstruction' of these sub-prompts implicitly by in-context learning with semantically similar but harmless reassembling demo, and (c) a `Synonym Search' of sub-prompts, aiming to find sub-prompts' synonyms that maintain the original intent while jailbreaking LLMs. An extensive empirical study across multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrates that, with a significantly reduced number of queries, DrAttack obtains a substantial gain of success rate over prior SOTA prompt-only attackers. Notably, the success rate of 78.0\% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries surpassed previous art by 33.1\%. The project is available at https://github.com/xirui-li/DrAttack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timoth\'ee Ly (LAAS-ROC), Julien Ferry (EPM), Marie-Jos\'e Huguet (LAAS-ROC), S\'ebastien Gambs (UQAM), Ulrich Aivodji (ETS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially-private (DP) mechanisms can be embedded into the design of a machine learning algorithm to protect the resulting model against privacy leakage. However, this often comes with a significant loss of accuracy due to the noise added to enforce DP. In this paper, we aim at improving this trade-off for a popular class of machine learning algorithms leveraging the Gini impurity as an information gain criterion to greedily build interpretable models such as decision trees or rule lists. To this end, we establish the smooth sensitivity of the Gini impurity, which can be used to obtain thorough DP guarantees while adding noise scaled with tighter magnitude. We illustrate the applicability of this mechanism by integrating it within a greedy algorithm producing rule list models, motivated by the fact that such models remain understudied in the DP literature. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that the DP rule lists models integrating smooth sensitivity have higher accuracy that those using other DP frameworks based on global sensitivity, for identical privacy budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Luo, Junlong Du, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Diffusion Models has dramatically improved image generation quality, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and generated images. This development, while impressive, also raises significant privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive speed enhancement of 8 times. Code is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in numerous domains, yet they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that can compromise their performance and ethical application. The detection of these attacks is crucial for maintaining the reliability and security of GNN classification tasks, but effective detection techniques are lacking. Recognizing the challenge in detecting such intrusions, we devised a novel detection method that creatively leverages graph-level explanations. By extracting and transforming secondary outputs from GNN explanation mechanisms, we developed seven innovative metrics for effective detection of backdoor attacks on GNNs. Additionally, we develop an adaptive attack to rigorously evaluate our approach. We test our method on multiple benchmark datasets and examine its efficacy against various attack models. Our results show that our method can achieve high detection performance, marking a significant advancement in safeguarding GNNs against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behnam Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting possibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with potential applications in various domains, including marketing research and consumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term "token noise" effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Luo, Zangwei Zheng, Zirui Zhu, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: The increase in parameter size of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces significant capabilities, particularly in-context learning, where MLLMs enhance task performance without updating pre-trained parameters. This effectiveness, however, hinges on the appropriate selection of in-context examples, a process that is currently biased towards visual data, overlooking textual information. Furthermore, the area of supervised retrievers for MLLMs, crucial for optimal in-context example selection, continues to be uninvestigated. Our study offers an in-depth evaluation of the impact of textual information on the unsupervised selection of in-context examples in multimodal contexts, uncovering a notable sensitivity of retriever performance to the employed modalities. Responding to this, we introduce a novel supervised MLLM-retriever MSIER that employs a neural network to select examples that enhance multimodal in-context learning efficiency. This approach is validated through extensive testing across three distinct tasks, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we investigate the influence of modalities on our supervised retrieval method's training and pinpoint factors contributing to our model's success. This exploration paves the way for future advancements, highlighting the potential for refined in-context learning in MLLMs through the strategic use of multimodal data.</p>

Leveraging a balanced VQA dataset, we investigate three distinct strategies. Firstly, GAN-based approaches aim to generate answer embeddings conditioned on image and question inputs, showing potential but struggling with more complex tasks. Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions. Lastly, attention mechanisms, incorporating Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), address language priors and attention modeling, albeit with a complexity-performance trade-off. This study underscores the challenges and opportunities in VQA and suggests avenues for future research, including alternative GAN formulations and attentional mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Bach Nguyen, Paul Youssef, Christin Seifert, J\"org Schl\"otterer</p>
<p>Abstract: As NLP models become more complex, understanding their decisions becomes more crucial. Counterfactuals (CFs), where minimal changes to inputs flip a model's prediction, offer a way to explain these models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in generating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by investigating how well LLMs generate CFs for two NLU tasks. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs, assessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data augmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated CFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that LLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal. Generating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI where LLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label. This also reflects on the data augmentation performance, where we observe a large gap between augmenting with human and LLMs CFs. Furthermore, we evaluate LLMs' ability to assess CFs in a mislabelled data setting, and show that they have a strong bias towards agreeing with the provided labels. GPT4 is more robust against this bias and its scores correlate well with automatic metrics. Our findings reveal several limitations and point to potential future work directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhe Shi, Qinwei Ma, Huan Ma, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future work.

<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly being used to automate complicated tasks in digital environments. Just as humans benefit from powerful software applications, such as integrated development environments, for complex tasks like software engineering, we posit that LM agents represent a new category of end users with their own needs and abilities, and would benefit from specially-built interfaces to the software they use. We investigate how interface design affects the performance of language model agents. As a result of this exploration, we introduce SWE-agent: a system that facilitates LM agents to autonomously use computers to solve software engineering tasks. SWE-agent's custom agent-computer interface (ACI) significantly enhances an agent's ability to create and edit code files, navigate entire repositories, and execute tests and other programs. We evaluate SWE-agent on SWE-bench and HumanEvalFix, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both with a pass@1 rate of 12.5% and 87.7%, respectively, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art achieved with non-interactive LMs. Finally, we provide insight on how the design of the ACI can impact agents' behavior and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is an important problem with applications in areas such as malware analysis, vulnerability research and license violation detection. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network architecture combined with a novel graph data representation called call graphlets. A call graphlet encodes the neighborhood around each function in a binary executable, capturing the local and global context through a series of statistical features. A specialized graph neural network model operates on this graph representation, learning to map it to a feature vector that encodes semantic binary code similarities using deep-metric learning. The proposed approach is evaluated across five distinct datasets covering different architectures, compiler tool chains, and optimization levels. Experimental results show that the combination of call graphlets and the novel graph neural network architecture achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques across cross-architecture, mono-architecture and zero shot tasks. In addition, our proposed approach also performs well when evaluated against an out-of-domain function inlining task. The work provides a general and effective graph neural network-based solution for conducting binary code similarity detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zheng, Chang Yu, Jin Cao, Yongshun Xu, Qianwen Xing, Yinxin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of various online and mobile payment systems, transaction fraud has become a significant threat to financial security. This study explores the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically based on XGBoost and LightGBM, for developing a more accurate and robust Payment Security Protection Model. To enhance data reliability, we meticulously processed the data sources and applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance and improve data representation. By selecting highly correlated features, we aimed to strengthen the training process and boost model performance. We conducted thorough performance evaluations of our proposed models, comparing them against traditional methods including Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, we rigorously assessed their effectiveness. Our detailed analyses and comparisons reveal that the combination of SMOTE with XGBoost and LightGBM offers a highly efficient and powerful mechanism for payment security protection. Moreover, the integration of XGBoost and LightGBM in a Local Ensemble model further demonstrated outstanding performance. After incorporating SMOTE, the new combined model achieved a significant improvement of nearly 6\% over traditional models and around 5\% over its sub-models, showcasing remarkable results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of Domain Adaptive in the field of Object Detection involves the transfer of object detection models from labeled source domains to unannotated target domains. Recent advancements in this field aim to address domain discrepancies by aligning pixel-pairs across domains within a non-Euclidean graphical space, thereby minimizing semantic distribution variance. Despite their remarkable achievements, these methods often use coarse semantic representations to model graphs, mainly due to ignoring non-informative elements and failing to focus on precise semantic alignment. Additionally, the generation of coarse graphs inherently introduces abnormal nodes, posing challenges and potentially biasing domain adaptation outcomes. Consequently, we propose a framework, which utilizes the Graph Generation to enhance the quality of DAOD (\method{}). Specifically, we introduce a Node Refinement module that utilizes a memory bank to reconstruct noisy sampled nodes while applying contrastive regularization to noisy features. To enhance semantic alignment, we propose separating domain-specific styles from category invariance encoded within graph covariances, which allows us to selectively remove domain-specific styles while preserving category-invariant information, thus facilitating more accurate semantic alignment across different domains. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Optimization adaptor, leveraging variational inference to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes. Extensive experimentation across three adaptation benchmarks validates that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haian Jin, Yuan Li, Fujun Luan, Yuanbo Xiangli, Sai Bi, Kai Zhang, Zexiang Xu, Jin Sun, Noah Snavely</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image relighting is a challenging task that involves reasoning about the complex interplay between geometry, materials, and lighting. Many prior methods either support only specific categories of images, such as portraits, or require special capture conditions, like using a flashlight. Alternatively, some methods explicitly decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as normals and BRDFs, which can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, revealing and harnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion model. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild Internet imagery and demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and accuracy. Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion. Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as relighting a radiance field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang, Liping Chen, Kong AiK Lee, Zhen-Hua Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice anonymization has been developed as a technique for preserving privacy by replacing the speaker's voice in a speech signal with that of a pseudo-speaker, thereby obscuring the original voice attributes from machine recognition and human perception. In this paper, we focus on altering the voice attributes against machine recognition while retaining human perception. We referred to this as the asynchronous voice anonymization. To this end, a speech generation framework incorporating a speaker disentanglement mechanism is employed to generate the anonymized speech. The speaker attributes are altered through adversarial perturbation applied on the speaker embedding, while human perception is preserved by controlling the intensity of perturbation. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech dataset showed that the speaker attributes were obscured with their human perception preserved for 60.71% of the processed utterances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Ni, Shuchen Meng, Xieming Geng, Panfeng Li, Zhuoying Li, Xupeng Chen, Xiaotong Wang, Shiyao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, necessitating precise forecasting models for monitoring vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG. Traditional models, such as ARIMA and Prophet, are limited by their need for manual parameter tuning and challenges in handling noisy, sparse, and highly variable medical data. This study investigates advanced deep learning models, including LSTM, and transformer-based architectures, for predicting heart rate time series from the MIT-BIH Database. Results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly PatchTST, significantly outperform traditional models across multiple metrics, capturing complex patterns and dependencies more effectively. This research underscores the potential of deep learning to enhance patient monitoring and CVD management, suggesting substantial clinical benefits. Future work should extend these findings to larger, more diverse datasets and real-world clinical applications to further validate and optimize model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christof Tinnes, Alisa Welter, Sven Apel</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling structure and behavior of software systems plays a crucial role in the industrial practice of software engineering. As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large language models are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yu, Qingxuan Lv, Yuezun Li, Zhiqiang Wei, Junyu Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Phytoplankton, a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems, requires efficient monitoring to understand marine ecological processes and environmental conditions. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods, relying on non-in situ observations, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting timely analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce PhyTracker, an intelligent in situ tracking framework designed for automatic tracking of phytoplankton. PhyTracker overcomes significant challenges unique to phytoplankton monitoring, such as constrained mobility within water flow, inconspicuous appearance, and the presence of impurities. Our method incorporates three innovative modules: a Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction (TFE) module, an Attention-enhanced Temporal Association (ATA) module, and a Flow-agnostic Movement Refinement (FMR) module. These modules enhance feature capture, differentiate between phytoplankton and impurities, and refine movement characteristics, respectively. Extensive experiments on the PMOT dataset validate the superiority of PhyTracker in phytoplankton tracking, and additional tests on the MOT dataset demonstrate its general applicability, outperforming conventional tracking methods. This work highlights key differences between phytoplankton and traditional objects, offering an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Hu Yiran, Qingyao Ai, Yueyue Wu, Cheng Luo, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly shaped the applications of AI in multiple fields, including the studies of legal intelligence. Trained on extensive legal texts, including statutes and legal documents, the legal LLMs can capture important legal knowledge/concepts effectively and provide important support for downstream legal applications such as legal consultancy. Yet, the dynamic nature of legal statutes and interpretations also poses new challenges to the use of LLMs in legal applications. Particularly, how to update the legal knowledge of LLMs effectively and efficiently has become an important research problem in practice. Existing benchmarks for evaluating knowledge update methods are mostly designed for the open domain and cannot address the specific challenges of the legal domain, such as the nuanced application of new legal knowledge, the complexity and lengthiness of legal regulations, and the intricate nature of legal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce the Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark, i.e. LeKUBE, which evaluates knowledge update methods for legal LLMs across five dimensions. Specifically, we categorize the needs of knowledge updates in the legal domain with the help of legal professionals, and then hire annotators from law schools to create synthetic updates to the Chinese Criminal and Civil Code as well as sets of questions of which the answers would change after the updates. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge update methods, we reveal a notable gap between existing knowledge update methods and the unique needs of the legal domain, emphasizing the need for further research and development of knowledge update mechanisms tailored for legal LLMs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02487">LiCoEval: Evaluating LLMs on License Compliance in Code Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiwei Xu, Kai Gao, Hao He, Minghui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers. However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production. This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code. To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code. Based on this standard, we propose LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs, i.e., the ability to provide accurate license or copyright information when they generate code with striking similarity to already existing copyrighted code. Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations. Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks. Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bank credit risk is a significant challenge in modern financial transactions, and the ability to identify qualified credit card holders among a large number of applicants is crucial for the profitability of a bank'sbank's credit card business. In the past, screening applicants'applicants' conditions often required a significant amount of manual labor, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although the accuracy and reliability of previously used ML models have been continuously improving, the pursuit of more reliable and powerful AI intelligent models is undoubtedly the unremitting pursuit by major banks in the financial industry. In this study, we used a dataset of over 40,000 records provided by a commercial bank as the research object. We compared various dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and T-SNE for preprocessing high-dimensional datasets and performed in-depth adaptation and tuning of distributed models such as LightGBM and XGBoost, as well as deep models like Tabnet. After a series of research and processing, we obtained excellent research results by combining SMOTEENN with these techniques. The experiments demonstrated that LightGBM combined with PCA and SMOTEENN techniques can assist banks in accurately predicting potential high-quality customers, showing relatively outstanding performance compared to other models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henryk Mustroph, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The EU AI Act mandates that providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems establish a quality management system (QMS). Among other criteria, a QMS shall help verify and document the AI system design and quality and monitor the proper implementation of all high-risk AI system requirements. Current research rarely explores practical solutions for implementing the EU AI Act. Instead, it tends to focus on theoretical concepts. As a result, more attention must be paid to tools that help humans actively check and document AI systems and orchestrate the implementation of all high-risk AI system requirements. Therefore, this paper introduces a new design concept and prototype for a QMS as a microservice Software as a Service web application. It connects directly to the AI system for verification and documentation and enables the orchestration and integration of various sub-services, which can be individually designed, each tailored to specific high-risk AI system requirements. The first version of the prototype connects to the Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct LLM as an example of an AI system and integrates a risk management system and a data management system. The prototype is evaluated through a qualitative assessment of the implemented requirements, a GPU memory and performance analysis, and an evaluation with IT, AI, and legal experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate stock market predictions following earnings reports are crucial for investors. Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI-driven financial analysis tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingzhu Wen, Yong Zhou, Xiaoyang Li, Yuanming Shi, Kaibin Huang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi, Zixiao Jiang, Xiangyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Constituency parsing involves analyzing a sentence by breaking it into sub-phrases, or constituents. While many deep neural models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task, they often overlook the entity-violating issue, where an entity fails to form a complete sub-tree in the resultant parsing tree. To address this, we propose an entity-aware biaffine attention model for constituent parsing. This model incorporates entity information into the biaffine attention mechanism by using additional entity role vectors for potential phrases, which enhances the parsing accuracy. We introduce a new metric, the Entity Violating Rate (EVR), to quantify the extent of entity violations in parsing results. Experiments on three popular datasets-ONTONOTES, PTB, and CTB-demonstrate that our model achieves the lowest EVR while maintaining high precision, recall, and F1-scores comparable to existing models. Further evaluation in downstream tasks, such as sentence sentiment analysis, highlights the effectiveness of our model and the validity of the proposed EVR metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Huang, Chen Wang, Yunzhu Li, Ruohan Zhang, Li Fei-Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing robotic manipulation tasks as constraints that associate the robot and the environment is a promising way to encode desired robot behaviors. However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are 1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep is expressed as Python functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost. We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observations. We present system implementations on a wheeled single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild, bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment models.

However, most existing dependency-based approaches ignore the positive influence of the words outside the dependency trees, sometimes conveying rich and useful information on relation extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Entity-aware Self-attention Contextualized GCN (ESC-GCN), which efficiently incorporates syntactic structure of input sentences and semantic context of sequences. To be specific, relative position self-attention obtains the overall semantic pairwise correlation related to word position, and contextualized graph convolutional networks capture rich intra-sentence dependencies between words by adequately pruning operations. Furthermore, entity-aware attention layer dynamically selects which token is more decisive to make final relation prediction. In this way, our proposed model not only reduces the noisy impact from dependency trees, but also obtains easily-ignored entity-related semantic representation. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that our model achieves encouraging performance as compared to existing dependency-based and sequence-based models. Specially, our model excels in extracting relations between entities of long sentences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangtai Sun, Danyu Luo, Da Ma, Zihan Zhao, Baocai Chen, Zhennan Shen, Su Zhu, Lu Chen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant upsurge of interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist scientific discovery. However, most LLMs only focus on general science, while they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as chemical molecules and amino acid sequences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciDFM, a mixture-of-experts LLM, which is trained from scratch and is able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning and understand molecules and amino acid sequences. We collect a large-scale training corpus containing numerous scientific papers and books from different disciplines as well as data from domain-specific databases. We further fine-tune the pre-trained model on lots of instruction data to improve performances on downstream benchmarks. From experiment results, we show that SciDFM achieves strong performance on general scientific benchmarks such as SciEval and SciQ, and it reaches a SOTA performance on domain-specific benchmarks among models of similar size. We further analyze the expert layers and show that the results of expert selection vary with data from different disciplines. To benefit the broader research community, we open-source SciDFM at https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/SciDFM-MoE-A5.6B-v1.0.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Morafah, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Hojin Chang, Chen Chen, Bill Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, while preserving user data privacy. Despite its potential, standard FL lacks support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which vary significantly in model and dataset sizes -- from small IoT devices to large workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing knowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge effectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied capabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of informative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones, and the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all devices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique contributions of each. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device prototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to preserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a KD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the noisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the separately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic knowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the knowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present theoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in transferring knowledge across heterogeneous devices with varying capacities. Comprehensive evaluations of our method across both CV and NLP tasks demonstrate that TAKFL achieves SOTA results in a variety of datasets and settings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods Code is released at https://github.com/MMorafah/TAKFL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaorui Tan, Xi Yang, Qiufeng Wang, Anh Nguyen, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hospitals in India still rely on handwritten medical records despite the availability of Electronic Medical Records (EMR), complicating statistical analysis and record retrieval. Handwritten records pose a unique challenge, requiring specialized data for training models to recognize medications and their recommendation patterns. While traditional handwriting recognition approaches employ 2-D LSTMs, recent studies have explored using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for OCR tasks. Building on this approach, we focus on extracting medication names and dosages from simulated medical records. Our methodology MIRAGE (Multimodal Identification and Recognition of Annotations in indian GEneral prescriptions) involves fine-tuning the QWEN VL, LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 models on 743,118 high resolution simulated medical record images-fully annotated from 1,133 doctors across India. Our approach achieves 82% accuracy in extracting medication names and dosages.</p>

<p>Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) has gained significant attention due to its potential for understanding and analyzing human emotions. While recent advancements in deep learning techniques have substantially improved EER, the field lacks a convincing benchmark and comprehensive open-source libraries. This absence complicates fair comparisons between models and creates reproducibility challenges for practitioners, which collectively hinder progress. To address these issues, we introduce LibEER, a comprehensive benchmark and algorithm library designed to facilitate fair comparisons in EER. LibEER carefully selects popular and powerful baselines, harmonizes key implementation details across methods, and provides a standardized codebase in PyTorch. By offering a consistent evaluation framework with standardized experimental settings, LibEER enables unbiased assessments of over ten representative deep learning models for EER across the four most widely used datasets. Additionally, we conduct a thorough, reproducible comparison of model performance and efficiency, providing valuable insights to guide researchers in the selection and design of EER models. Moreover, we make observations and in-depth analysis on the experiment results and identify current challenges in this community. We hope that our work will not only lower entry barriers for newcomers to EEG-based emotion recognition but also contribute to the standardization of research in this domain, fostering steady development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyi Wang, Zhihao Wu, Jianheng Liu, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiong Wang, Yangze Li, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Lei Xie, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Long Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has recently brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve speech-to-speech dialogue. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We designed 3-stage training strategies both for the modeling of speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech dialogue ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while the end-to-end latency of the spoken response achieves a low level. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, making Freeze-Omni have a more natural style of dialogue ability between the users. Freeze-Omni mainly provides a possibility for researchers to conduct multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding various impacts caused by the catastrophic forgetting of LLM caused by fewer data and training resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fin Gentzen, Mounir Bensalem, Admela Jukan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models, data and software need to be regularly updated whenever essential version updates are released and feasible for integration. This is a basic but most challenging requirement to satisfy in the edge, due to the various system constraints and the major impact that an update can have on robustness and stability. In this paper, we formulate for the first time the ML model versioning optimization problem, and propose effective solutions, including the update automation with reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm. We study the edge network environment due to the known constraints in performance, response time, security, and reliability, which make updates especially challenging. The performance study shows that model version updates can be fully and effectively automated with reinforcement learning method. We show that for every range of server load values, the proper versioning can be found that improves security, reliability and/or ML model accuracy, while assuring a comparably lower response time.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations are foundational in modeling science and natural systems such as fluid dynamics and weather forecasting. The Latent Evolution of PDEs method is designed to address the computational intensity of classical and deep learning-based PDE solvers by proposing a scalable and efficient alternative. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of LE-PDE, we incorporate the Mamba model, an advanced machine learning model known for its predictive efficiency and robustness in handling complex dynamic systems with a progressive learning strategy. The LE-PDE was tested on several benchmark problems. The method demonstrated a marked reduction in computational time compared to traditional solvers and standalone deep learning models while maintaining high accuracy in predicting system behavior over time. Our method doubles the inference speed compared to the LE-PDE while retaining the same level of parameter efficiency, making it well-suited for scenarios requiring long-term predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Bechler-Speicher, Moshe Eliasof, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Amir Globerson</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have inherent representational limitations due to their message-passing structure. Recent work has suggested that these limitations can be overcome by using unique node identifiers (UIDs). Here we argue that despite the advantages of UIDs, one of their disadvantages is that they lose the desirable property of permutation-equivariance. We thus propose to focus on UID models that are permutation-equivariant, and present theoretical arguments for their advantages. Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UID models towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss. We empirically demonstrate that our approach improves generalization and extrapolation abilities while providing faster training convergence. On the recent BREC expressiveness benchmark, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other random-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge to the cognitive capabilities of LLMs. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the mathematical ability of LLMs. However, few recognize the value of state transition for LLM reasoning. In this work, we define mathematical problem-solving as a process of transiting from an initial unsolved state to the final resolved state, and propose Kwai-STaR framework, which transforms LLMs into State-Transition Reasoners to improve their intuitive reasoning capabilities. Our approach comprises three main steps: (1) Define the state space tailored to the mathematical reasoning. (2) Generate state-transition data based on the state space. (3) Convert original LLMs into State-Transition Reasoners via a curricular training strategy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of Kwai-STaR in enhancing mathematical reasoning: After training on the small-scale Kwai-STaR dataset, general LLMs, including Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3, achieve considerable performance gain on the GSM8K and GSM-Hard dataset. Additionally, the state transition-based design endows Kwai-STaR with remarkable training and inference efficiency. Further experiments are underway to establish the generality of Kwai-STaR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Wu, Kevin Wu, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: There is great interest in fine-tuning frontier large language models (LLMs) to inject new information and update existing knowledge. While commercial LLM fine-tuning APIs from providers such as OpenAI and Google promise flexible adaptation for various applications, the efficacy of fine-tuning remains unclear. In this study, we introduce FineTuneBench, an evaluation framework and dataset for understanding how well commercial fine-tuning APIs can successfully learn new and updated knowledge. We analyze five frontier LLMs with commercially available fine-tuning APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, on their effectiveness in two settings: (1) ingesting novel information, such as recent news events and new people profiles, and (2) updating existing knowledge, such as updated medical guidelines and code frameworks. Our results reveal substantial shortcomings in all the models' abilities to effectively learn new information through fine-tuning, with an average generalization accuracy of 37% across all models. When updating existing knowledge, such as incorporating medical guideline updates, commercial fine-tuning APIs show even more limited capability (average generalization accuracy of 19%). Overall, fine-tuning GPT-4o mini is the most effective for infusing new knowledge and updating knowledge, followed by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o. The fine-tuning APIs for Gemini 1.5 Flesh and Gemini 1.5 Pro are unable to learn new knowledge or update existing knowledge. These findings underscore a major shortcoming in using current commercial fine-tuning services to achieve reliable knowledge infusion in common scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Ramachandran, Souvik Kundu, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores how the Large Language Models (LLMs) adjust linguistic features to create personalized persuasive outputs. While research showed that LLMs personalize outputs, a gap remains in understanding the linguistic features of their persuasive capabilities. We identified 13 linguistic features crucial for influencing personalities across different levels of the Big Five model of personality. We analyzed how prompts with personality trait information influenced the output of 19 LLMs across five model families. The findings show that models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer cognitive processes words for openness to experience. Some model families excel at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness, while only one model adapts language for neuroticism. Our findings show how LLMs tailor responses based on personality cues in prompts, indicating their potential to create persuasive content affecting the mind and well-being of the recipients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eva Zhang, Arka Pal, Akilesh Potti, Micah Goldblum</p>
<p>Abstract: As fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly prevalent, users often rely on third-party services with limited visibility into their fine-tuning processes. This lack of transparency raises the question: how do consumers verify that fine-tuning services are performed correctly? For instance, a service provider could claim to fine-tune a model for each user, yet simply send all users back the same base model. To address this issue, we propose vTune, a simple method that uses a small number of backdoor data points added to the training data to provide a statistical test for verifying that a provider fine-tuned a custom model on a particular user's dataset. Unlike existing works, vTune is able to scale to verification of fine-tuning on state-of-the-art LLMs, and can be used both with open-source and closed-source models. We test our approach across several model families and sizes as well as across multiple instruction-tuning datasets, and find that the statistical test is satisfied with p-values on the order of $\sim 10^{-40}$, with no negative impact on downstream task performance. Further, we explore several attacks that attempt to subvert vTune and demonstrate the method's robustness to these attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Viti, Franz Thaler, Kathrin Lisa Kapper, Martin Urschler, Martin Holler, Elias Karabelas</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI) is crucial for the analysis and assessment of cardiac function, helping to diagnose and treat various cardiovascular diseases. Most recent techniques rely on deep learning and usually require an extensive amount of labeled data. To overcome this problem, few-shot learning has the capability of reducing data dependency on labeled data. In this work, we introduce a new method that merges few-shot learning with a U-Net architecture and Gaussian Process Emulators (GPEs), enhancing data integration from a support set for improved performance. GPEs are trained to learn the relation between the support images and the corresponding masks in latent space, facilitating the segmentation of unseen query images given only a small labeled support set at inference. We test our model with the M&Ms-2 public dataset to assess its ability to segment the heart in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging from different orientations, and compare it with state-of-the-art unsupervised and few-shot methods. Our architecture shows higher DICE coefficients compared to these methods, especially in the more challenging setups where the size of the support set is considerably small.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Sun, Hanpeng Wu, Xi Sheryl Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The pretraining and fine-tuning approach has become the leading technique for various NLP applications. However, recent studies reveal that fine-tuning data, due to their sensitive nature, domain-specific characteristics, and identifiability, pose significant privacy concerns. To help develop more privacy-resilient fine-tuning models, we introduce a novel active privacy auditing framework, dubbed Parsing, designed to identify and quantify privacy leakage risks during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of language models (LMs). The framework leverages improved white-box membership inference attacks (MIAs) as the core technology, utilizing novel learning objectives and a two-stage pipeline to monitor the privacy of the LMs' fine-tuning process, maximizing the exposure of privacy risks. Additionally, we have improved the effectiveness of MIAs on large LMs including GPT-2, Llama2, and certain variants of them. Our research aims to provide the SFT community of LMs with a reliable, ready-to-use privacy auditing tool, and to offer valuable insights into safeguarding privacy during the fine-tuning process. Experimental results confirm the framework's efficiency across various models and tasks, emphasizing notable privacy concerns in the fine-tuning process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoad Tewel, Rinon Gal, Dvir Samuel, Yuval Atzmon, Lior Wolf, Gal Chechik</p>
<p>Abstract: Adding Object into images based on text instructions is a challenging task in semantic image editing, requiring a balance between preserving the original scene and seamlessly integrating the new object in a fitting location. Despite extensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance, particularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complex scenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion models' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources: the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted extended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details while ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image insertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed "Additing Affordance Benchmark" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming supervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80% of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.</p>
