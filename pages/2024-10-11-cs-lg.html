<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Sanfins, Fabio Ramos, Danilo Naiff</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a neural network algorithm designed to automatically identify similarity relations from data. By uncovering these similarity relations, our network approximates the underlying physical laws that relate dimensionless quantities to their dimensionless variables and coefficients. Additionally, we develop a linear algebra framework, accompanied by code, to derive the symmetry groups associated with these similarity relations. While our approach is general, we illustrate its application through examples in fluid mechanics, including laminar Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows in smooth pipes, as well as turbulent flows in both smooth and rough pipes. Such examples are chosen to highlight the framework's capability to handle both simple and intricate cases, and further validates its effectiveness in discovering underlying physical laws from data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanchayan Dutta (UC Davis), Suvrit Sra (TU Munich)</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that memory-augmented Transformers (Memformers) can implement linear first-order optimization methods such as conjugate gradient descent, momentum methods, and more generally, methods that linearly combine past gradients. Building on prior work that demonstrates how Transformers can simulate preconditioned gradient descent, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that Memformers can learn more advanced optimization algorithms. Specifically, we analyze how memory registers in Memformers store suitable intermediate attention values allowing them to implement algorithms such as conjugate gradient. Our results show that Memformers can efficiently learn these methods by training on random linear regression tasks, even learning methods that outperform conjugate gradient. This work extends our knowledge about the algorithmic capabilities of Transformers, showing how they can learn complex optimization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglun Li, Miao Zhang, Yingqi Liu, Quanjun Yin, Li Shen, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning has emerged as an alternative to centralized architectures due to its faster training, privacy preservation, and reduced communication overhead. In decentralized communication, the server aggregation phase in Centralized Federated Learning shifts to the client side, which means that clients connect with each other in a peer-to-peer manner. However, compared to the centralized mode, data heterogeneity in Decentralized Federated Learning will cause larger variances between aggregated models, which leads to slow convergence in training and poor generalization performance in tests. To address these issues, we introduce Catalyst Acceleration and propose an acceleration Decentralized Federated Learning algorithm called DFedCata. It consists of two main components: the Moreau envelope function, which primarily addresses parameter inconsistencies among clients caused by data heterogeneity, and Nesterov's extrapolation step, which accelerates the aggregation phase. Theoretically, we prove the optimization error bound and generalization error bound of the algorithm, providing a further understanding of the nature of the algorithm and the theoretical perspectives on the hyperparameter choice. Empirically, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in both convergence speed and generalization performance on CIFAR10/100 with various non-iid data distributions. Furthermore, we also experimentally verify the theoretical properties of DFedCata.</p>

<p>Abstract: In rapidly evolving e-commerce industry, the capability of selecting high-quality data for model training is essential. This study introduces the High-Utility Sequential Pattern Mining using SHAP values (HUSPM-SHAP) model, a utility mining-based active learning strategy to tackle this challenge. We found that the parameter settings for positive and negative SHAP values impact the model's mining outcomes, introducing a key consideration into the active learning framework. Through extensive experiments aimed at predicting behaviors that do lead to purchases or not, the designed HUSPM-SHAP model demonstrates its superiority across diverse scenarios. The model's ability to mitigate labeling needs while maintaining high predictive performance is highlighted. Our findings demonstrate the model's capability to refine e-commerce data processing, steering towards more streamlined, cost-effective prediction modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilong Li, Xiaohu Wu, Xiaoli Tang, Tiantian He, Yew-Soon Ong, Mengmeng Chen, Qiqi Liu, Qicheng Lao, Xiaoxiao Li, Han Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: There is growing research interest in measuring the statistical heterogeneity of clients' local datasets. Such measurements are used to estimate the suitability for collaborative training of personalized federated learning (PFL) models. Currently, these research endeavors are taking place in silos and there is a lack of a unified benchmark to provide a fair and convenient comparison among various approaches in common settings. We aim to bridge this important gap in this paper. The proposed benchmarking framework currently includes six representative approaches. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare these approaches under five standard non-IID FL settings, providing much needed insights into which approaches are advantageous under which settings. The proposed framework offers useful guidance on the suitability of various data divergence measures in FL systems. It is beneficial for keeping related research activities on the right track in terms of: (1) designing PFL schemes, (2) selecting appropriate data heterogeneity evaluation approaches for specific FL application scenarios, and (3) addressing fairness issues in collaborative model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Antonio Martin H., Freddy Perozo, Manuel Lopez</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning is a pivotal area in the field of machine learning, focusing on the development of methods to automatically discover the representations or features needed for a given task from raw data. Unlike traditional feature engineering, which requires manual crafting of features, representation learning aims to learn features that are more useful and relevant for tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering. We introduce Principal Orthogonal Latent Components Analysis Network (POLCA Net), an approach to mimic and extend PCA and LDA capabilities to non-linear domains. POLCA Net combines an autoencoder framework with a set of specialized loss functions to achieve effective dimensionality reduction, orthogonality, variance-based feature sorting, high-fidelity reconstructions, and additionally, when used with classification labels, a latent representation well suited for linear classifiers and low dimensional visualization of class distribution as well.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07299">Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> \"Ozg\"un Turgut, Philip M\"uller, Martin J. Menten, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: In natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised pre-training on large datasets unlocks foundational model capabilities across domains and tasks. However, this potential has not yet been realised in time series analysis, where existing methods disregard the heterogeneous nature of time series characteristics. Time series are prevalent in many domains, including medicine, engineering, natural sciences, and finance, but their characteristics vary significantly in terms of variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal dynamics, and sampling frequency. This inherent heterogeneity across domains prevents effective pre-training on large time series corpora. To address this issue, we introduce OTiS, an open model for general time series analysis, that has been specifically designed to handle multi-domain heterogeneity. We propose a novel pre-training paradigm including a tokeniser with learnable domain-specific signatures, a dual masking strategy to capture temporal causality, and a normalised cross-correlation loss to model long-range dependencies. Our model is pre-trained on a large corpus of 640,187 samples and 11 billion time points spanning 8 distinct domains, enabling it to analyse time series from any (unseen) domain. In comprehensive experiments across 15 diverse applications - including classification, regression, and forecasting - OTiS showcases its ability to accurately capture domain-specific data characteristics and demonstrates its competitiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Jin, Bo Zhu, Li Yuan, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods. To achieve this, we propose MoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both Feed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we introduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace operations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low Computing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within vanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs, be adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High Performance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++ allows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater performance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that zero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all zero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed across different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each token to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the appropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++ achieves better performance while delivering 1.1-2.1x expert forward throughput compared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation for developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07352">Generating Origin-Destination Matrices in Neural Spatial Interaction Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Zachos, Mark Girolami, Theodoros Damoulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are proliferating as decision-making tools across policy areas in transportation, economics, and epidemiology. In these models, a central object of interest is the discrete origin-destination matrix which captures spatial interactions and agent trip counts between locations. Existing approaches resort to continuous approximations of this matrix and subsequent ad-hoc discretisations in order to perform ABM simulation and calibration. This impedes conditioning on partially observed summary statistics, fails to explore the multimodal matrix distribution over a discrete combinatorial support, and incurs discretisation errors. To address these challenges, we introduce a computationally efficient framework that scales linearly with the number of origin-destination pairs, operates directly on the discrete combinatorial space, and learns the agents' trip intensity through a neural differential equation that embeds spatial interactions. Our approach outperforms the prior art in terms of reconstruction error and ground truth matrix coverage, at a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate these benefits in large-scale spatial mobility ABMs in Cambridge, UK and Washington, DC, USA.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07395">LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular $Y|X$-Shifts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Zeng, Jiashuo Liu, Henry Lam, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: For tabular datasets, the change in the relationship between the label and covariates ($Y|X$-shifts) is common due to missing variables (a.k.a. confounders). Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07397">Aligning AI-driven discovery with human intuition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Zhang, Hod Lipson</p>
<p>Abstract: As data-driven modeling of physical dynamical systems becomes more prevalent, a new challenge is emerging: making these models more compatible and aligned with existing human knowledge. AI-driven scientific modeling processes typically begin with identifying hidden state variables, then deriving governing equations, followed by predicting and analyzing future behaviors. The critical initial step of identification of an appropriate set of state variables remains challenging for two reasons. First, finding a compact set of meaningfully predictive variables is mathematically difficult and under-defined. A second reason is that variables found often lack physical significance, and are therefore difficult for human scientists to interpret. We propose a new general principle for distilling representations that are naturally more aligned with human intuition, without relying on prior physical knowledge. We demonstrate our approach on a number of experimental and simulated system where the variables generated by the AI closely resemble those chosen independently by human scientists. We suggest that this principle can help make human-AI collaboration more fruitful, as well as shed light on how humans make scientific modeling choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil Khan, Sudeep Pasricha</p>
<p>Abstract: In emerging high-performance Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, efficient power management is crucial to minimize energy consumption. We propose a novel framework called CAFEEN that employs both heuristic-based fine-grained and machine learning-based coarse-grained power-gating for energy-efficient NoCs. CAFEEN uses a fine-grained method to activate only essential NoC buffers during lower network loads. It switches to a coarse-grained method at peak loads to minimize compounding wake-up overhead using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Results show that CAFEEN adaptively balances power-efficiency with performance, reducing total energy by 2.60x for single application workloads and 4.37x for multi-application workloads, compared to state-of-the-art NoC power-gating frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit networks are a class of neural networks whose outputs are defined by the fixed point of a parameterized operator. They have enjoyed success in many applications including natural language processing, image processing, and numerous other applications. While they have found abundant empirical success, theoretical work on its generalization is still under-explored. In this work, we consider a large family of implicit networks defined parameterized contractive fixed point operators. We show a generalization bound for this class based on a covering number argument for the Rademacher complexity of these architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gavin Kerrigan, Kai Nelson, Padhraic Smyth</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, and in machine learning it is common to model temporal point processes in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance can be unsatisfactory in forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors. We propose EventFlow, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. Our model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. EventFlow is likelihood-free, easy to implement and sample from, and either matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks on a set of standard benchmarks</p>

First, we construct a decoder-only Transformer that can solve SAT using backtracking and deduction via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We prove its correctness by showing trace equivalence to the well-known DPLL SAT-solving algorithm. Second, to support the implementation of this abstract construction, we design a compiler $\texttt{PARAT}$ that takes as input a procedural specification and outputs a transformer model implementing this specification. Third, rather than $\textit{programming}$ a transformer to reason, we evaluate empirically whether it can be $\textit{trained}$ to do so by learning directly from algorithmic traces ("reasoning paths") of the DPLL algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumeet Batra, Gaurav S. Sukhatme</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Md. Akmol Masud, M. F. Mridha, Zeyar Aung, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Heart failure remains a major global health challenge, contributing significantly to the 17.8 million annual deaths from cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic tools. Current heart disease prediction models based on classical machine learning face limitations, including poor handling of high-dimensional, imbalanced data, limited performance on small datasets, and a lack of uncertainty quantification, while also being difficult for healthcare professionals to interpret. To address these issues, we introduce KACQ-DCNN, a novel classical-quantum hybrid dual-channel neural network that replaces traditional multilayer perceptrons and convolutional layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). This approach enhances function approximation with learnable univariate activation functions, reducing model complexity and improving generalization. The KACQ-DCNN 4-qubit 1-layered model significantly outperforms 37 benchmark models across multiple metrics, achieving an accuracy of 92.03%, a macro-average precision, recall, and F1 score of 92.00%, and an ROC-AUC score of 94.77%. Ablation studies demonstrate the synergistic benefits of combining classical and quantum components with KAN. Additionally, explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP provide feature-level insights, improving model transparency, while uncertainty quantification via conformal prediction ensures robust probability estimates. These results suggest that KACQ-DCNN offers a promising path toward more accurate, interpretable, and reliable heart disease predictions, paving the way for advancements in cardiovascular healthcare.</p>

These results are demonstrated first on test cases before being shown on more complex networks, including transformers, auto-encoders, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning studies. In testing on a wide range of architectures, we highlight the universal nature of training dynamics and further discuss how it can be used to understand the mechanisms behind learning in neural networks. We identify two such dominant mechanisms present throughout machine learning training. The first, information compression, is seen through a reduction in the entropy of the NTK spectrum during training, and occurs predominantly in small neural networks. The second, coined structure formation, is seen through an increasing entropy and thus, the creation of structure in the neural network representations beyond the prior established by the network at initialization. Due to the ubiquity of the latter in deep neural network architectures and its flexibility in the creation of feature-rich representations, we argue that this form of evolution of the network's entropy be considered the onset of a deep learning regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Venhoff, Anisoara Calinescu, Philip Torr, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: A key challenge in interpretability is to decompose model activations into meaningful features. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for this task. However, a central problem in evaluating the quality of SAEs is the absence of ground truth features to serve as an evaluation gold standard. Current evaluation methods for SAEs are therefore confronted with a significant trade-off: SAEs can either leverage toy models or other proxies with predefined ground truth features; or they use extensive prior knowledge of realistic task circuits. The former limits the generalizability of the evaluation results, while the latter limits the range of models and tasks that can be used for evaluations. We introduce SAGE: Scalable Autoencoder Ground-truth Evaluation, a ground truth evaluation framework for SAEs that scales to large state-of-the-art SAEs and models. We demonstrate that our method can automatically identify task-specific activations and compute ground truth features at these points. Compared to previous methods we reduce the training overhead by introducing a novel reconstruction method that allows to apply residual stream SAEs to sublayer activations. This eliminates the need for SAEs trained on every task-specific activation location. Then we validate the scalability of our framework, by evaluating SAEs on novel tasks on Pythia70M, GPT-2 Small, and Gemma-2-2. Our framework therefore paves the way for generalizable, large-scale evaluations of SAEs in interpretability research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwook Rhyu, Joachim Schaeffer, Michael L. Li, Xiao Cui, William C. Chueh, Martin Z. Bazant, Richard D. Braatz</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization of the formation step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing is challenging due to limited physical understanding of solid electrolyte interphase formation and the long testing time (~100 days) for cells to reach the end of life. We propose a systematic feature design framework that requires minimal domain knowledge for accurate cycle life prediction during formation. Two simple Q(V) features designed from our framework, extracted from formation data without any additional diagnostic cycles, achieved a median of 9.20% error for cycle life prediction, outperforming thousands of autoML models using pre-defined features. We attribute the strong performance of our designed features to their physical origins - the voltage ranges identified by our framework capture the effects of formation temperature and microscopic particle resistance heterogeneity. By designing highly interpretable features, our approach can accelerate formation research, leveraging the interplay between data-driven feature design and mechanistic understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Shen, Pin-Yu Chen, Payel Das, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific data to boost downstream performance is a crucial step for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning the models on several adversarial samples or even benign data can greatly comprise the model's pre-equipped alignment and safety capabilities. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel framework to enhance safety in LLM fine-tuning. SEAL learns a data ranker based on the bilevel optimization to up rank the safe and high-quality fine-tuning data and down rank the unsafe or low-quality ones. Models trained with SEAL demonstrate superior quality over multiple baselines, with 8.5% and 9.7% win rate increase compared to random selection respectively on Llama-3-8b-Instruct and Merlinite-7b models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07472">Exploring the design space of deep-learning-based weather forecasting systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Jean Kossaifi, Boris Bonev, Christopher Choy, Jan Kautz, David Krueger, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in developing deep-learning-based weather forecasting systems, their design space, including the impact of different design choices, is yet to be well understood. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by systematically analyzing these choices including architecture, problem formulation, pretraining scheme, use of image-based pretrained models, loss functions, noise injection, multi-step inputs, additional static masks, multi-step finetuning (including larger stride models), as well as training on a larger dataset. We study fixed-grid architectures such as UNet, fully convolutional architectures, and transformer-based models, along with grid-invariant architectures, including graph-based and operator-based models. Our results show that fixed-grid architectures outperform grid-invariant architectures, indicating a need for further architectural developments in grid-invariant models such as neural operators. We therefore propose a hybrid system that combines the strong performance of fixed-grid models with the flexibility of grid-invariant architectures. We further show that multi-step fine-tuning is essential for most deep-learning models to work well in practice, which has been a common practice in the past. Pretraining objectives degrade performance in comparison to supervised training, while image-based pretrained models provide useful inductive biases in some cases in comparison to training the model from scratch. Interestingly, we see a strong positive effect of using a larger dataset when training a smaller model as compared to training on a smaller dataset for longer. Larger models, on the other hand, primarily benefit from just an increase in the computational budget. We believe that these results will aid in the design of better weather forecasting systems in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: A recent line of work in mechanistic interpretability has focused on reverse-engineering the computation performed by neural networks trained on the binary operation of finite groups. We investigate the internals of one-hidden-layer neural networks trained on this task, revealing previously unidentified structure and producing a more complete description of such models that unifies the explanations of previous works. Notably, these models approximate equivariance in each input argument. We verify that our explanation applies to a large fraction of networks trained on this task by translating it into a compact proof of model performance, a quantitative evaluation of model understanding. In particular, our explanation yields a guarantee of model accuracy that runs in 30% the time of brute force and gives a >=95% accuracy bound for 45% of the models we trained. We were unable to obtain nontrivial non-vacuous accuracy bounds using only explanations from previous works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suryanarayana Maddu, Victor Chard\`es, Michael. J. Shelley</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daogao Liu, Kunal Talwar</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a gap between finding a first-order stationary point (FOSP) and a second-order stationary point (SOSP) under differential privacy constraints, and it remains unclear whether privately finding an SOSP is more challenging than finding an FOSP. Specifically, Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrated that an $\alpha$-SOSP can be found with $\alpha=O(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon})^{3/7})$, where $n$ is the dataset size, $d$ is the dimension, and $\epsilon$ is the differential privacy parameter. Building on the SpiderBoost algorithm framework, we propose a new approach that uses adaptive batch sizes and incorporates the binary tree mechanism. Our method improves the results for privately finding an SOSP, achieving $\alpha=O(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon})^{1/2})$. This improved bound matches the state-of-the-art for finding an FOSP, suggesting that privately finding an SOSP may be achievable at no additional cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07505">CrossQuant: A Post-Training Quantization Method with Smaller Quantization Kernel for Precise Large Language Model Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Liu, Xindian Ma, Peng Zhang, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). While many studies focus on quantizing both weights and activations, it is still a challenge to maintain the accuracy of LLM after activating quantization. To investigate the primary cause, we extend the concept of kernel from linear algebra to quantization functions to define a new term, "quantization kernel", which refers to the set of elements in activations that are quantized to zero. Through quantitative analysis of the quantization kernel, we find that these elements are crucial for maintaining the accuracy of quantized LLMs. With the decrease of quantization kernel, the precision of quantized LLMs increases. If the quantization kernel proportion is kept below 19% for OPT models and below 1% for LLaMA models, the precision loss from quantizing activations to INT8 becomes negligible. Motivated by the goal of developing a quantization method with small quantization kernel, we propose CrossQuant: a simple yet effective method for quantizing activations. CrossQuant cross-quantizes elements using row and column-wise absolute maximum vectors, achieving a quantization kernel of approximately 16% for OPT models and less than 0.1% for LLaMA models. Experimental results on LLMs (LLaMA, OPT) ranging from 6.7B to 70B parameters demonstrate that CrossQuant improves or maintains perplexity and accuracy in language modeling, zero-shot, and few-shot tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyuan Ma, Cheng Ji, Jingde Wang, Wei Sun, Xun Tang, Zheyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce MOLA: a Multi-block Orthogonal Long short-term memory Autoencoder paradigm, to conduct accurate, reliable fault detection of industrial processes. To achieve this, MOLA effectively extracts dynamic orthogonal features by introducing an orthogonality-based loss function to constrain the latent space output. This helps eliminate the redundancy in the features identified, thereby improving the overall monitoring performance. On top of this, a multi-block monitoring structure is proposed, which categorizes the process variables into multiple blocks by leveraging expert process knowledge about their associations with the overall process. Each block is associated with its specific Orthogonal Long short-term memory Autoencoder model, whose extracted dynamic orthogonal features are monitored by distance-based Hotelling's $T^2$ statistics and quantile-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) designed for multivariate data streams that are nonparametric, heterogeneous in nature. Compared to having a single model accounting for all process variables, such a multi-block structure improves the overall process monitoring performance significantly, especially for large-scale industrial processes. Finally, we propose an adaptive weight-based Bayesian fusion (W-BF) framework to aggregate all block-wise monitoring statistics into a global statistic that we monitor for faults, with the goal of improving fault detection speed by assigning weights to blocks based on the sequential order where alarms are raised. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our MOLA framework by applying it to the Tennessee Eastman Process and comparing the performance with various benchmark methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07511">CSGDN: Contrastive Signed Graph Diffusion Network for Predicting Crop Gene-Trait Associations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiru Pan, Xingyu Ji, Jiaqi You, Lu Li, Zhenping Liu, Xianlong Zhang, Zeyu Zhang, Maojun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Positive and negative association preidiction between gene and trait help studies for crops to perform complex physiological functions. The transcription and regulation activity of specific genes will be adjusted accordingly in different cell types, developmental stages, and physiological states to meet the needs of organisms. Determing gene-trait associations can resolve the mechanism of trait formation and benefit the improvement of crop yield and quality. There are the following two problems in obtaining the positive/negative associations between gene and trait: 1) High-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing and trait data collection are expensive and time-consuming due to the need to process large sample sizes; 2) experiments introduce both random and systematic errors, and, at the same time, calculations or predictions using software or models may produce noise. To address these two issues, we propose a Contrastive Signed Graph Diffusion Network, CSGDN, to learn robust node representations with fewer training samples to achieve higher link prediction accuracy. CSGDN employs a signed graph diffusion method to uncover the underlying regulatory associations between genes and traits. Then, stochastic perterbation strategies are used to create two views for both original and diffusive graphs. At last, a multi-view contrastive learning paradigm loss is designed to unify the node presentations learned from the two views to resist interference and reduce noise. We conduct experiments to validate the performance of CSGDN on three crop datasets: Gossypium hirsutum, Brassica napus, and Triticum turgidum. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 9.28% AUC for link sign prediction in G. hirsutum dataset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07513">Evolutionary Contrastive Distillation for Language Model Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Katz-Samuels, Zheng Li, Hyokun Yun, Priyanka Nigam, Yi Xu, Vaclav Petricek, Bing Yin, Trishul Chilimbi</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to execute complex instructions is essential for their real-world applications. However, several recent studies indicate that LLMs struggle with challenging instructions. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Contrastive Distillation (ECD), a novel method for generating high-quality synthetic preference data designed to enhance the complex instruction-following capability of language models. ECD generates data that specifically illustrates the difference between a response that successfully follows a set of complex instructions and a response that is high-quality, but nevertheless makes some subtle mistakes. This is done by prompting LLMs to progressively evolve simple instructions to more complex instructions. When the complexity of an instruction is increased, the original successful response to the original instruction becomes a "hard negative" response for the new instruction, mostly meeting requirements of the new instruction, but barely missing one or two. By pairing a good response with such a hard negative response, and employing contrastive learning algorithms such as DPO, we improve language models' ability to follow complex instructions. Empirically, we observe that our method yields a 7B model that exceeds the complex instruction-following performance of current SOTA 7B models and is competitive even with open-source 70B models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gyroscopes are crucial for accurate angular velocity measurements in navigation, stabilization, and control systems. MEMS gyroscopes offer advantages like compact size and low cost but suffer from errors and inaccuracies that are complex and time varying. This study leverages machine learning (ML) and uses multiple signals of the MEMS resonator gyroscope to improve its calibration. XGBoost, known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, and MLP, recognized for its capability to model intricate patterns through multiple layers and hidden dimensions, are employed to enhance the calibration process. Our findings show that both XGBoost and MLP models significantly reduce noise and enhance accuracy and stability, outperforming the traditional calibration techniques. Despite higher computational costs, DL models are ideal for high-stakes applications, while ML models are efficient for consumer electronics and environmental monitoring. Both ML and DL models demonstrate the potential of advanced calibration techniques in enhancing MEMS gyroscope performance and calibration efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Fang, Guiliang Liu, Wei Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied in healthcare can lead to unsafe medical decisions and treatment, such as excessive dosages or abrupt changes, often due to agents overlooking common-sense constraints. Consequently, Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a natural choice for safe decisions. However, specifying the exact cost function is inherently difficult in healthcare. Recent Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a promising approach that infers constraints from expert demonstrations. ICRL algorithms model Markovian decisions in an interactive environment. These settings do not align with the practical requirement of a decision-making system in healthcare, where decisions rely on historical treatment recorded in an offline dataset. To tackle these issues, we propose the Constraint Transformer (CT). Specifically, 1) we utilize a causal attention mechanism to incorporate historical decisions and observations into the constraint modeling, while employing a Non-Markovian layer for weighted constraints to capture critical states. 2) A generative world model is used to perform exploratory data augmentation, enabling offline RL methods to simulate unsafe decision sequences. In multiple medical scenarios, empirical results demonstrate that CT can capture unsafe states and achieve strategies that approximate lower mortality rates, reducing the occurrence probability of unsafe behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Liu, Artin Tajdini, Andrew Wagenmaker, Chen-Yu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In linear bandits, how can a learner effectively learn when facing corrupted rewards? While significant work has explored this question, a holistic understanding across different adversarial models and corruption measures is lacking, as is a full characterization of the minimax regret bounds. In this work, we compare two types of corruptions commonly considered: strong corruption, where the corruption level depends on the action chosen by the learner, and weak corruption, where the corruption level does not depend on the action chosen by the learner. We provide a unified framework to analyze these corruptions. For stochastic linear bandits, we fully characterize the gap between the minimax regret under strong and weak corruptions. We also initiate the study of corrupted adversarial linear bandits, obtaining upper and lower bounds with matching dependencies on the corruption level. Next, we reveal a connection between corruption-robust learning and learning with gap-dependent mis-specification, a setting first studied by Liu et al. (2023a), where the misspecification level of an action or policy is proportional to its suboptimality. We present a general reduction that enables any corruption-robust algorithm to handle gap-dependent misspecification. This allows us to recover the results of Liu et al. (2023a) in a black-box manner and significantly generalize them to settings like linear MDPs, yielding the first results for gap-dependent misspecification in reinforcement learning. However, this general reduction does not attain the optimal rate for gap-dependent misspecification. Motivated by this, we develop a specialized algorithm that achieves optimal bounds for gap-dependent misspecification in linear bandits, thus answering an open question posed by Liu et al. (2023a).</p>

<p>Abstract: Rank aggregation through crowdsourcing has recently gained significant attention, particularly in the context of listwise ranking annotations. However, existing methods primarily focus on a single problem and partial ranks, while the aggregation of listwise full ranks across numerous problems remains largely unexplored. This scenario finds relevance in various applications, such as model quality assessment and reinforcement learning with human feedback. In light of practical needs, we propose LAC, a Listwise rank Aggregation method in Crowdsourcing, where the global position information is carefully measured and included. In our design, an especially proposed annotation quality indicator is employed to measure the discrepancy between the annotated rank and the true rank. We also take the difficulty of the ranking problem itself into consideration, as it directly impacts the performance of annotators and consequently influences the final results. To our knowledge, LAC is the first work to directly deal with the full rank aggregation problem in listwise crowdsourcing, and simultaneously infer the difficulty of problems, the ability of annotators, and the ground-truth ranks in an unsupervised way. To evaluate our method, we collect a real-world business-oriented dataset for paragraph ranking. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LAC method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow. The proposed method leverages the (conditional) optimal transport theory to learn the probability flow in a simulation-free manner, in which the initial noise, missing data, and observations are treated as the source distribution, target distribution, and conditional information, respectively. According to the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to incorporate more prior information into the model, we parameterize the derivative of a task-specific potential function via a variational autoencoder, and combine it with the base estimator to formulate a Rao-Blackwellized sampler. The propose model allows us to take less intermediate steps to produce high-quality samples for inference compared to existing diffusion methods. Finally, the experimental results on the real-word datasets show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on time series imputation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongpeng Jin, Yanzhao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Learning Rate (LR) has a high impact on deep learning training performance. A common practice is to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) multiple times with different LR policies to find the optimal LR policy, which has been widely recognized as a daunting and costly task. Moreover, multiple times of DNN training has not been effectively utilized. In practice, often only the optimal LR is adopted, which misses the opportunities to further enhance the overall accuracy of the deep learning system and results in a huge waste of both computing resources and training time. This paper presents a novel framework, LREnsemble, to effectively leverage effective learning rate tuning to boost deep ensemble performance. We make three original contributions. First, we show that the LR tuning with different LR policies can produce highly diverse DNNs, which can be supplied as base models for deep ensembles. Second, we leverage different ensemble selection algorithms to identify high-quality deep ensembles from the large pool of base models with significant accuracy improvements over the best single base model. Third, we propose LREnsemble, a framework that utilizes the synergy of LR tuning and deep ensemble techniques to enhance deep learning performance. The experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of LREnsemble, generating up to 2.34% accuracy improvements over well-optimized baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs and $6\times$ fewer unimodal data for ImageNet classification and misinformative news captions detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Tao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization of user association in a densely deployed heterogeneous cellular network is usually challenging and even more complicated due to the dynamic nature of user mobility and fluctuation in user counts. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. In addition, existing DRL-based user association methods are usually only applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. In this paper, we propose a parallel digital twin (DT)-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with both dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. Our method employs a distributed DRL strategy to handle varying user numbers and exploits a refined neural network structure for faster convergence. To address these DRL training-related challenges, we devise a high-fidelity DT construction technique, featuring a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on a diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. Armed with this DT environment, DRL agents are enabled to be trained without the need for interactions with the physical network. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve the training efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed parallel DT-driven DRL method achieves closely comparable performance to real environment training, and even outperforms those trained in a single real-world environment with nearly 20% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Zurek, Yudong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the plug-in approach for learning $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The plug-in approach constructs a model estimate then computes an average-reward optimal policy in the estimated model. Despite representing arguably the simplest algorithm for this problem, the plug-in approach has never been theoretically analyzed. Unlike the more well-studied discounted MDP reduction method, the plug-in approach requires no prior problem information or parameter tuning. Our results fill this gap and address the limitations of prior approaches, as we show that the plug-in approach is optimal in several well-studied settings without using prior knowledge. Specifically it achieves the optimal diameter- and mixing-based sample complexities of $\widetilde{O}\left(SA \frac{D}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(SA \frac{\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, respectively, without knowledge of the diameter $D$ or uniform mixing time $\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}$. We also obtain span-based bounds for the plug-in approach, and complement them with algorithm-specific lower bounds suggesting that they are unimprovable. Our results require novel techniques for analyzing long-horizon problems which may be broadly useful and which also improve results for the discounted plug-in approach, removing effective-horizon-related sample size restrictions and obtaining the first optimal complexity bounds for the full range of sample sizes without reward perturbation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Zhao, Hanze Dong, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.</p>

We prove that theoretical results on the implicit bias of 2-layer neural networks can be used to provably reconstruct a set of which at least a constant fraction are training points in a univariate setting, and can also be used to identify with high probability whether a given point was used in the training set in a high dimensional setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Hou, Vincent Y. F. Tan, Zixin Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a {\em novel} piecewise stationary linear bandit (PSLB) model, where the environment randomly samples a context from an unknown probability distribution at each changepoint, and the quality of an arm is measured by its return averaged over all contexts. The contexts and their distribution, as well as the changepoints are unknown to the agent. We design {\em Piecewise-Stationary $\varepsilon$-Best Arm Identification$^+$} (PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$), an algorithm that is guaranteed to identify an $\varepsilon$-optimal arm with probability $\ge 1-\delta$ and with a minimal number of samples. PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ consists of two subroutines, PS$\varepsilon$BAI and {\sc Na\"ive $\varepsilon$-BAI} (N$\varepsilon$BAI), which are executed in parallel. PS$\varepsilon$BAI actively detects changepoints and aligns contexts to facilitate the arm identification process. When PS$\varepsilon$BAI and N$\varepsilon$BAI are utilized judiciously in parallel, PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is shown to have a finite expected sample complexity. By proving a lower bound, we show the expected sample complexity of PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. We compare PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ to baseline algorithms using numerical experiments which demonstrate its efficiency. Both our analytical and numerical results corroborate that the efficacy of PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is due to the delicate change detection and context alignment procedures embedded in PS$\varepsilon$BAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Balagansky, Ian Maksimov, Daniil Gavrilov</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how features evolve across layers in deep neural networks is a fundamental challenge in mechanistic interpretability, particularly due to polysemanticity and feature superposition. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to extract interpretable features from individual layers, aligning these features across layers has remained an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SAE Match, a novel, data-free method for aligning SAE features across different layers of a neural network. Our approach involves matching features by minimizing the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs, a technique that incorporates activation thresholds into the encoder and decoder weights to account for differences in feature scales. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma 2 language model, we demonstrate that our method effectively captures feature evolution across layers, improving feature matching quality. We also show that features persist over several layers and that our approach can approximate hidden states across layers. Our work advances the understanding of feature dynamics in neural networks and provides a new tool for mechanistic interpretability studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Second-order federated learning (FL) algorithms offer faster convergence than their first-order counterparts by leveraging curvature information. However, they are hindered by high computational and storage costs, particularly for large-scale models. Furthermore, the communication overhead associated with large models and digital transmission exacerbates these challenges, causing communication bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a scalable second-order FL algorithm using a sparse Hessian estimate and leveraging over-the-air aggregation, making it feasible for larger models. Our simulation results demonstrate more than $67\%$ of communication resources and energy savings compared to other first and second-order baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxing Yu, Shiqi Wang, Han Yin, Zhenlong Sun, Ruobing Xie, Bo Zhang, Yanghui Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on detecting clickbait posts on the Web. These posts often use eye-catching disinformation in mixed modalities to mislead users to click for profit. That affects the user experience and thus would be blocked by content provider. To escape detection, malicious creators use tricks to add some irrelevant non-bait content into bait posts, dressing them up as legal to fool the detector. This content often has biased relations with non-bait labels, yet traditional detectors tend to make predictions based on simple co-occurrence rather than grasping inherent factors that lead to malicious behavior. This spurious bias would easily cause misjudgments. To address this problem, we propose a new debiased method based on causal inference. We first employ a set of features in multiple modalities to characterize the posts. Considering these features are often mixed up with unknown biases, we then disentangle three kinds of latent factors from them, including the invariant factor that indicates intrinsic bait intention; the causal factor which reflects deceptive patterns in a certain scenario, and non-causal noise. By eliminating the noise that causes bias, we can use invariant and causal factors to build a robust model with good generalization ability. Experiments on three popular datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07675">Adversarial Robustness Overestimation and Instability in TRADES</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Weiping Li, Ren-Wei Liang, Cheng-Han Yeh, Cheng-Chang Tsai, Kuanchun Yu, Chun-Shien Lu, Shang-Tse Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the phenomenon of probabilistic robustness overestimation in TRADES, a prominent adversarial training method. Our study reveals that TRADES sometimes yields disproportionately high PGD validation accuracy compared to the AutoAttack testing accuracy in the multiclass classification task. This discrepancy highlights a significant overestimation of robustness for these instances, potentially linked to gradient masking. We further analyze the parameters contributing to unstable models that lead to overestimation. Our findings indicate that smaller batch sizes, lower beta values (which control the weight of the robust loss term in TRADES), larger learning rates, and higher class complexity (e.g., CIFAR-100 versus CIFAR-10) are associated with an increased likelihood of robustness overestimation. By examining metrics such as the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC), inner-maximization, and gradient information, we identify the underlying cause of this phenomenon as gradient masking and provide insights into it. Furthermore, our experiments show that certain unstable training instances may return to a state without robust overestimation, inspiring our attempts at a solution. In addition to adjusting parameter settings to reduce instability or retraining when overestimation occurs, we recommend incorporating Gaussian noise in inputs when the FOSC score exceed the threshold. This method aims to mitigate robustness overestimation of TRADES and other similar methods at its source, ensuring more reliable representation of adversarial robustness during evaluation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07678">FedEP: Tailoring Attention to Heterogeneous Data Distribution with Entropy Pooling for Decentralized Federated Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Feng, Hongjie Guan, Alberto Huertas Celdr\'an, Jan von der Assen, G\'er\^ome Bovet, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) performance is highly influenced by data distribution across clients, and non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) leads to a slower convergence of the global model and a decrease in model effectiveness. The existing algorithms for solving the non-IID problem are focused on the traditional centralized FL (CFL), where a central server is used for model aggregation. However, in decentralized FL (DFL), nodes lack the overall vision of the federation. To address the non-IID problem in DFL, this paper proposes a novel DFL aggregation algorithm, Federated Entropy Pooling (FedEP). FedEP mitigates the client drift problem by incorporating the statistical characteristics of local distributions instead of any actual data. Prior to training, each client conducts a local distribution fitting using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and shares the resulting statistical characteristics with its neighbors. After receiving the statistical characteristics shared by its neighbors, each node tries to fit the global data distribution. In the aggregation phase, each node calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences of the local data distribution over the fitted global data distribution, giving the weights to generate the aggregated model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that FedEP can achieve faster convergence and show higher test performance than state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to exhibit a bias toward low-rank solutions during training, implicitly learning low-dimensional feature representations. This paper investigates how deep multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) encode these feature manifolds and connects this behavior to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory. We introduce the concept of local rank as a measure of feature manifold dimensionality and demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that this rank decreases during the final phase of training. We argue that networks that reduce the rank of their learned representations also compress mutual information between inputs and intermediate layers. This work bridges the gap between feature manifold rank and information compression, offering new insights into the interplay between information bottlenecks and representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ubiquitous deployment of deep learning systems on resource-constrained Edge devices is hindered by their high computational complexity coupled with their fragility to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially to naturally occurring common corruptions. Current solutions rely on the Cloud to train and compress models before deploying to the Edge. This incurs high energy and latency costs in transmitting locally acquired field data to the Cloud while also raising privacy concerns. We propose GEARnn (Growing Efficient, Accurate, and Robust neural networks) to grow and train robust networks in-situ, i.e., completely on the Edge device. Starting with a low-complexity initial backbone network, GEARnn employs One-Shot Growth (OSG) to grow a network satisfying the memory constraints of the Edge device using clean data, and robustifies the network using Efficient Robust Augmentation (ERA) to obtain the final network. We demonstrate results on a NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, and analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, model size, energy consumption, and training time. Our results demonstrate the construction of efficient, accurate, and robust networks entirely on an Edge device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Chen, Yuan Zhang, Liyuan Cao, Kun Yuan, Zaiwen Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces memory costs when adapting large language models (LLMs) for downstream applications. However, traditional first-order (FO) fine-tuning algorithms incur substantial memory overhead due to the need to store activation values for back-propagation during gradient computation, particularly in long-context fine-tuning tasks. Zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms offer a promising alternative by approximating gradients using finite differences of function values, thus eliminating the need for activation storage. Nevertheless, existing ZO methods struggle to capture the low-rank gradient structure common in LLM fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a low-rank ZO gradient estimator and introduces a novel low-rank ZO algorithm (LOZO) that effectively captures this structure in LLMs. We provide convergence guarantees for LOZO by framing it as a subspace optimization method. Additionally, its low-rank nature enables LOZO to integrate with momentum techniques while incurring negligible extra memory costs. Extensive experiments across various model sizes and downstream tasks demonstrate that LOZO and its momentum-based variant outperform existing ZO methods and closely approach the performance of FO algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convergence in learning-to-optimize is hardly studied, because conventional convergence guarantees in optimization are based on geometric arguments, which cannot be applied easily to learned algorithms. Thus, we develop a probabilistic framework that resembles deterministic optimization and allows for transferring geometric arguments into learning-to-optimize. Our main theorem is a generalization result for parametric classes of potentially non-smooth, non-convex loss functions and establishes the convergence of learned optimization algorithms to stationary points with high probability. This can be seen as a statistical counterpart to the use of geometric safeguards to ensure convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove convergence of optimization algorithms in such a probabilistic framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explaining why and how a tree $t$ structurally differs from another tree $t^*$ is a question that is encountered throughout computer science, including in understanding tree-structured data such as XML or JSON data. In this article, we explore how to learn explanations for structural differences between pairs of trees from sample data: suppose we are given a set $\{(t_1, t_1^*),\dots, (t_n, t_n^*)\}$ of pairs of labelled, ordered trees; is there a small set of rules that explains the structural differences between all pairs $(t_i, t_i^*)$? This raises two research questions: (i) what is a good notion of "rule" in this context?; and (ii) how can sets of rules explaining a data set be learnt algorithmically?
  We explore these questions from the perspective of database theory by (1) introducing a pattern-based specification language for tree transformations; (2) exploring the computational complexity of variants of the above algorithmic problem, e.g. showing NP-hardness for very restricted variants; and (3) discussing how to solve the problem for data from CS education research using SAT solvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gradient Smoothing is an efficient approach to reducing noise in gradient-based model explanation method. SmoothGrad adds Gaussian noise to mitigate much of these noise. However, the crucial hyper-parameter in this method, the variance $\sigma$ of Gaussian noise, is set manually or with heuristic approach. However, it results in the smoothed gradients still containing a certain amount of noise. In this paper, we aim to interpret SmoothGrad as a corollary of convolution, thereby re-understanding the gradient noise and the role of $\sigma$ from the perspective of confidence level. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive gradient smoothing method, AdaptGrad, based on these insights. Through comprehensive experiments, both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdaptGrad could effectively reduce almost all the noise in vanilla gradients compared with baselines methods. AdaptGrad is simple and universal, making it applicable for enhancing gradient-based interpretability methods for better visualization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating aircraft fuel flow is essential for evaluating new procedures, designing next-generation aircraft, and monitoring the environmental impact of current aviation practices. This paper investigates the generalization capabilities of deep learning models in predicting fuel consumption, focusing particularly on their performance for aircraft types absent from the training data. We propose a novel methodology that integrates neural network architectures with domain generalization techniques to enhance robustness and reliability across a wide range of aircraft. A comprehensive dataset containing 101 different aircraft types, separated into training and generalization sets, with each aircraft type set containing 1,000 flights. We employed the base of aircraft data (BADA) model for fuel flow estimates, introduced a pseudo-distance metric to assess aircraft type similarity, and explored various sampling strategies to optimize model performance in data-sparse regions. Our results reveal that for previously unseen aircraft types, the introduction of noise into aircraft and engine parameters improved model generalization. The model is able to generalize with acceptable mean absolute percentage error between 2\% and 10\% for aircraft close to existing aircraft, while performance is below 1\% error for known aircraft in the training set. This study highlights the potential of combining domain-specific insights with advanced machine learning techniques to develop scalable, accurate, and generalizable fuel flow estimation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite extensive research on adversarial examples, the underlying mechanisms of adversarially robust generalization, a critical yet challenging task for deep learning, remain largely unknown. In this work, we propose a novel perspective to decipher adversarially robust generalization through the lens of the Weight-Curvature Index (WCI). The proposed WCI quantifies the vulnerability of models to adversarial perturbations using the Frobenius norm of weight matrices and the trace of Hessian matrices. We prove generalization bounds based on PAC-Bayesian theory and second-order loss function approximations to elucidate the interplay between robust generalization gap, model parameters, and loss landscape curvature. Our theory and experiments show that WCI effectively captures the robust generalization performance of adversarially trained models. By offering a nuanced understanding of adversarial robustness based on the scale of model parameters and the curvature of the loss landscape, our work provides crucial insights for designing more resilient deep learning models, enhancing their reliability and security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web attacks are one of the major and most persistent forms of cyber threats, which bring huge costs and losses to web application-based businesses. Various detection methods, such as signature-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based, have been proposed to identify web attacks. However, these methods either (1) heavily rely on accurate and complete rule design and feature engineering, which may not adapt to fast-evolving attacks, or (2) fail to estimate model uncertainty, which is essential to the trustworthiness of the prediction made by the model. In this study, we proposed an Uncertainty-aware Ensemble Deep Kernel Learning (UEDKL) model to detect web attacks from HTTP request payload data with the model uncertainty captured from the perspective of both data distribution and model parameters. The proposed UEDKL utilizes a deep kernel learning model to distinguish normal HTTP requests from different types of web attacks with model uncertainty estimated from data distribution perspective. Multiple deep kernel learning models were trained as base learners to capture the model uncertainty from model parameters perspective. An attention-based ensemble learning approach was designed to effectively integrate base learners' predictions and model uncertainty. We also proposed a new metric named High Uncertainty Ratio-F Score Curve to evaluate model uncertainty estimation. Experiments on BDCI and SRBH datasets demonstrated that the proposed UEDKL framework yields significant improvement in both web attack detection performance and uncertainty estimation quality compared to benchmark models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Jarry, Philippe Very, Ramon Dalmau, Daniel Delahaye, Arthur Houdant</p>
<p>Abstract: The aviation industry is vital for global transportation but faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint, particularly CO2 emissions from ground operations such as taxiing. Single Engine Taxiing (SET) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance fuel efficiency and sustainability. However, evaluating SET's benefits is hindered by the limited availability of SET-specific data, typically accessible only to aircraft operators. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach to detect SET operations using ground trajectory data. Our method involves using proprietary Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data of A320 flights to label ground movements as SET or conventional taxiing during taxi-in operations, while using only trajectory features equivalent to those available in open-source surveillance systems such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) or ground radar. This demonstrates that SET can be inferred from ground movement patterns, paving the way for future work with non-proprietary data sources. Our results highlight the potential of deep learning to improve SET detection and support more comprehensive environmental impact assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Zhang, Yiyang Duan, Shuaicheng Niu, Yang Cao, Wei Yang Bryan Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a Federated Learning (FL) scenario where models are trained across multiple clients with unique data domains but a shared category space, without transmitting private data. The primary challenge in FDA is data heterogeneity, which causes significant divergences in gradient updates when using conventional averaging-based aggregation methods, reducing the efficacy of the global model. This further undermines both in-domain and out-of-domain performance (within the same federated system but outside the local client). To address this, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{M}ulti-domain \textbf{P}rototype-based \textbf{F}ederated Fine-\textbf{T}uning (MPFT). MPFT fine-tunes a pre-trained model using multi-domain prototypes, i.e., pretrained representations enriched with domain-specific information from category-specific local data. This enables supervised learning on the server to derive a globally optimized adapter that is subsequently distributed to local clients, without the intrusion of data privacy. Empirical results show that MPFT significantly improves both in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy over conventional methods, enhancing knowledge preservation and adaptation in FDA. Notably, MPFT achieves convergence within a single communication round, greatly reducing computation and communication costs. To ensure privacy, MPFT applies differential privacy to protect the prototypes. Additionally, we develop a prototype-based feature space hijacking attack to evaluate robustness, confirming that raw data samples remain unrecoverable even after extensive training epochs. The complete implementation of MPFL is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DomainFL/}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Han, Liang Du, Hongwei Du, Xiangguo Zhou, Yiwen Wu, Weibo Zheng, Donghong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Although many efforts have been made, it is still a challenge to balance the training budget, downstream performance, and the general capabilities of the LLMs in many applications. Training the whole model for downstream tasks is expensive, and could easily result in catastrophic forgetting. By introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), the training cost could be reduced, but it still suffers from forgetting, and limits the learning on the downstream tasks. To efficiently fine-tune the LLMs with less limitation to their downstream performance while mitigating the forgetting of general capabilities, we propose a novel mixture of expert (MoE) framework based on Soft LoRA and Identity Mixture (SLIM), that allows dynamic routing between LoRA adapters and skipping connection, enables the suppression of forgetting. We adopt weight-yielding with sliding clustering for better out-of-domain distinguish to enhance the routing. We also propose to convert the mixture of low-rank adapters to the model merging formulation and introduce fast dynamic merging of LoRA adapters to keep the general capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SLIM is comparable to the state-of-the-art PEFT approaches on the downstream tasks while achieving the leading performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roey Magen, Shuning Shang, Zhiwei Xu, Spencer Frei, Wei Hu, Gal Vardi</p>
<p>Abstract: The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a trained neural network perfectly fits noisy training data but still achieves near-optimal test performance, has been extensively studied in recent years for linear models and fully-connected/convolutional networks. In this work, we study benign overfitting in a single-head softmax attention model, which is the fundamental building block of Transformers. We prove that under appropriate conditions, the model exhibits benign overfitting in a classification setting already after two steps of gradient descent. Moreover, we show conditions where a minimum-norm/maximum-margin interpolator exhibits benign overfitting. We study how the overfitting behavior depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data distribution, namely, the ratio between norms of signal and noise tokens, and prove that a sufficiently large SNR is both necessary and sufficient for benign overfitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong-Hyun Park, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Satoshi Hayakawa, Yuhta Takida, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have seen notable success in continuous domains, leading to the development of discrete diffusion models (DDMs) for discrete variables. Despite recent advances, DDMs face the challenge of slow sampling speeds. While parallel sampling methods like $\tau$-leaping accelerate this process, they introduce $\textit{Compounding Decoding Error}$ (CDE), where discrepancies arise between the true distribution and the approximation from parallel token generation, leading to degraded sample quality. In this work, we present $\textit{Jump Your Steps}$ (JYS), a novel approach that optimizes the allocation of discrete sampling timesteps by minimizing CDE without extra computational cost. More precisely, we derive a practical upper bound on CDE and propose an efficient algorithm for searching for the optimal sampling schedule. Extensive experiments across image, music, and text generation show that JYS significantly improves sampling quality, establishing it as a versatile framework for enhancing DDM performance for fast sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Trommer, Bernd Waschneck, Akash Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to vary the arithmetic resource consumption of neural network applications at runtime, this work proposes the flexible reuse of approximate multipliers for neural network layer computations. We introduce a search algorithm that chooses an appropriate subset of approximate multipliers of a user-defined size from a larger search space and enables retraining to maximize task performance. Unlike previous work, our approach can output more than a single, static assignment of approximate multiplier instances to layers. These different operating points allow a system to gradually adapt its Quality of Service (QoS) to changing environmental conditions by increasing or decreasing its accuracy and resource consumption. QoS-Nets achieves this by reassigning the selected approximate multiplier instances to layers at runtime. To combine multiple operating points with the use of retraining, we propose a fine-tuning scheme that shares the majority of parameters between operating points, with only a small amount of additional parameters required per operating point. In our evaluation on MobileNetV2, QoS-Nets is used to select four approximate multiplier instances for three different operating points. These operating points result in power savings for multiplications between 15.3% and 42.8% at a Top-5 accuracy loss between 0.3 and 2.33 percentage points. Through our fine-tuning scheme, all three operating points only increase the model's parameter count by only 2.75%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiye Su, Iulia Duta, Lucie Charlotte Magister, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraph neural networks are a class of powerful models that leverage the message passing paradigm to learn over hypergraphs, a generalization of graphs well-suited to describing relational data with higher-order interactions. However, such models are not naturally interpretable, and their explainability has received very limited attention. We introduce SHypX, the first model-agnostic post-hoc explainer for hypergraph neural networks that provides both local and global explanations. At the instance-level, it performs input attribution by discretely sampling explanation subhypergraphs optimized to be faithful and concise. At the model-level, it produces global explanation subhypergraphs using unsupervised concept extraction. Extensive experiments across four real-world and four novel, synthetic hypergraph datasets demonstrate that our method finds high-quality explanations which can target a user-specified balance between faithfulness and concision, improving over baselines by 25 percent points in fidelity on average.</p>

Given a piece of redacted text we use a state of the art transformer-based deep learning network to reconstruct the original text. This generates multiple full texts that are consistent with the redacted text, i.e. which are grammatical, have the same non-redacted words etc, and represents each of these using an embedding vector that captures sentence similarity. In this way we can estimate the number, diversity and quality of full text consistent with the redacted text and so evaluate privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Naderi, Thiziri Nait Saada, Jared Tanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention layers are the core component of transformers, the current state-of-the-art neural network architecture. However, \softmaxx-based attention puts transformers' trainability at risk. Even \textit{at initialisation}, the propagation of signals and gradients through the random network can be pathological, resulting in known issues such as (i) vanishing/exploding gradients and (ii) \textit{rank collapse}, i.e. when all tokens converge to a single representation \textit{with depth}. This paper examines signal propagation in \textit{attention-only} transformers from a random matrix perspective, illuminating the origin of such issues, as well as unveiling a new phenomenon -- (iii) rank collapse \textit{in width}. Modelling \softmaxx-based attention at initialisation with Random Markov matrices, our theoretical analysis reveals that a \textit{spectral gap} between the two largest singular values of the attention matrix causes (iii), which, in turn, exacerbates (i) and (ii). Building on this insight, we propose a novel, yet simple, practical solution to resolve rank collapse in width by removing the spectral gap. Moreover, we validate our findings and discuss the training benefits of the proposed fix through experiments that also motivate a revision of some of the default parameter scaling. Our attention model accurately describes the standard key-query attention in a single-layer transformer, making this work a significant first step towards a better understanding of the initialisation dynamics in the multi-layer case.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are among the widely used Generative models in various applications. However, the original GAN architecture may memorize the distribution of the training data and, therefore, poses a threat to Membership Inference Attacks. In this work, we propose a new GAN framework that consists of Multiple Generators and Multiple Discriminators (MGMD-GAN). Disjoint partitions of the training data are used to train this model and it learns the mixture distribution of all the training data partitions. In this way, our proposed model reduces the generalization gap which makes our MGMD-GAN less vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks. We provide an experimental analysis of our model and also a comparison with other GAN frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Erdmann, Lars {\O}. Bentsen, Roy Stenbro, Heine N. Riise, Narada Warakagoda, Paal Engelstad</p>
<p>Abstract: Solar irradiance forecasts can be dynamic and unreliable due to changing weather conditions. Near the Arctic circle, this also translates into a distinct set of further challenges. This work is forecasting solar irradiance with Norwegian data using variations of Long-Short-Term Memory units (LSTMs). In order to gain more trustworthiness of results, the probabilistic approaches Quantile Regression (QR) and Maximum Likelihood (MLE) are optimized on top of the LSTMs, providing measures of uncertainty for the results. MLE is further extended by using a Johnson's SU distribution, a Johnson's SB distribution, and a Weibull distribution in addition to a normal Gaussian to model parameters. Contrary to a Gaussian, Weibull, Johnson's SU and Johnson's SB can return skewed distributions, enabling it to fit the non-normal solar irradiance distribution more optimally. The LSTMs are compared against each other, a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and a smart-persistence estimator. The proposed LSTMs are found to be more accurate than smart persistence and the MLP for a multi-horizon, day-ahead (36 hours) forecast. The deterministic LSTM showed better root mean squared error (RMSE), but worse mean absolute error (MAE) than a MLE with Johnson's SB distribution. Probabilistic uncertainty estimation is shown to fit relatively well across the distribution of observed irradiance. While QR shows better uncertainty estimation calibration, MLE with Johnson's SB, Johnson's SU, or Gaussian show better performance in the other metrics employed. Optimizing and comparing the models against each other reveals a seemingly inherent trade-off between point-prediction and uncertainty estimation calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luckeciano C. Melo, Alessandro Abate, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: A crucial capability of Machine Learning models in real-world applications is the ability to continuously learn new tasks. This adaptability allows them to respond to potentially inevitable shifts in the data-generating distribution over time. However, in Continual Learning (CL) settings, models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. Variational Continual Learning methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution and enforces it to stay close to the latest posterior estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. We evaluate the proposed objectives on challenging versions of popular CL benchmarks, demonstrating that they outperform standard Variational CL methods and non-variational baselines, effectively alleviating Catastrophic Forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsu Kim, Yu-Guan Hsieh, Michal Klein, Marco Cuturi, Jong Chul Ye, Bahjat Kawar, James Thornton</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models achieve remarkable generative performance but at the cost of many sampling steps, this slows inference and limits applicability to time-critical tasks. The ReFlow procedure can accelerate sampling by straightening generation trajectories. However, ReFlow is an iterative procedure, typically requiring training on simulated data, and results in reduced sample quality. To mitigate sample deterioration, we examine the design space of ReFlow and highlight potential pitfalls in prior heuristic practices. We then propose seven improvements for training dynamics, learning and inference, which are verified with thorough ablation studies on CIFAR10 $32 \times 32$, AFHQv2 $64 \times 64$, and FFHQ $64 \times 64$. Combining all our techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art FID scores (without / with guidance, resp.) for fast generation via neural ODEs: $2.23$ / $1.98$ on CIFAR10, $2.30$ / $1.91$ on AFHQv2, $2.84$ / $2.67$ on FFHQ, and $3.49$ / $1.74$ on ImageNet-64, all with merely $9$ neural function evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Dani\"els, Floris Geerts</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become an essential tool for analyzing graph-structured data, leveraging their ability to capture complex relational information. While the expressivity of GNNs, particularly their equivalence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) isomorphism test, has been well-documented, understanding their generalization capabilities remains critical. This paper focuses on the generalization of GNNs by investigating their Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We extend previous results to demonstrate that 1-dimensional GNNs with a single parameter have an infinite VC dimension for unbounded graphs. Furthermore, we show that this also holds for GNNs using analytic non-polynomial activation functions, including the 1-dimensional GNNs that were recently shown to be as expressive as the 1-WL test. These results suggest inherent limitations in the generalization ability of even the most simple GNNs, when viewed from the VC dimension perspective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mar\'ia Mart\'inez-Garc\'ia, Grace Villacr\'es, David Mitchell, Pablo M. Olmos</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep probabilistic models, learning low-dimensional discrete latent representations remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enhances variational inference in discrete latent variable models by leveraging Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) to introduce redundancy in the latent representations. This redundancy is then exploited by the variational posterior to yield more accurate estimates, thereby narrowing the variational gap. Inspired by ECCs commonly used in digital communications and data storage, we demonstrate proof-of-concept using a Discrete Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) with binary latent variables and block repetition codes. We further extend this idea to a hierarchical structure based on polar codes, where certain latent bits are more robustly protected. Our method improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty calibration compared to the uncoded DVAE, even when trained with tighter bounds such as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) objective. In particular, we demonstrate superior performance on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The general approach of integrating ECCs into variational inference is compatible with existing techniques to boost variational inference, such as importance sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We also outline the key properties ECCs must have to effectively enhance discrete variational inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natraj Raman, Sumitra Ganesh, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily designed to understand unstructured text. When directly applied to structured formats such as tabular data, they may struggle to discern inherent relationships and overlook critical patterns. While tabular representation learning methods can address some of these limitations, existing efforts still face challenges with sparse high-cardinality fields, precise numerical reasoning, and column-heavy tables. Furthermore, leveraging these learned representations for downstream tasks through a language based interface is not apparent. In this paper, we present an innovative and scalable solution to these challenges. Concretely, our approach introduces a multi-tier partitioning mechanism that utilizes power-law dynamics to handle large vocabularies, an adaptive quantization mechanism to impose priors on numerical continuity, and a distinct treatment of core-columns and meta-information columns. To facilitate instruction tuning on LLMs, we propose a parameter efficient decoder that interleaves transaction and text modalities using a series of adapter layers, thereby exploiting rich cross-task knowledge. We validate the efficacy of our solution on a large-scale dataset of synthetic payments transactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The structure of many real-world datasets is intrinsically hierarchical, making the modeling of such hierarchies a critical objective in both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Recently, novel approaches for hierarchical clustering with deep architectures have been proposed. In this work, we take a critical perspective on this line of research and demonstrate that many approaches exhibit major limitations when applied to realistic datasets, partly due to their high computational complexity. In particular, we show that a lightweight procedure implemented on top of pre-trained non-hierarchical clustering models outperforms models designed specifically for hierarchical clustering. Our proposed approach is computationally efficient and applicable to any pre-trained clustering model that outputs logits, without requiring any fine-tuning. To highlight the generality of our findings, we illustrate how our method can also be applied in a supervised setup, recovering meaningful hierarchies from a pre-trained ImageNet classifier.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Zhang, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Qiang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Edge Learning (FEL), an emerging distributed Machine Learning (ML) paradigm, enables model training in a distributed environment while ensuring user privacy by using physical separation for each user data. However, with the development of complex application scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Earth, the conventional resource allocation schemes can no longer effectively support these growing computational and communication demands. Therefore, joint resource optimization may be the key solution to the scaling problem. This paper simultaneously addresses the multifaceted challenges of computation and communication, with the growing multiple resource demands. We systematically review the joint allocation strategies for different resources (computation, data, communication, and network topology) in FEL, and summarize the advantages in improving system efficiency, reducing latency, enhancing resource utilization and enhancing robustness. In addition, we present the potential ability of joint optimization to enhance privacy preservation by reducing communication requirements, indirectly. This work not only provides theoretical support for resource management in federated learning (FL) systems, but also provides ideas for potential optimal deployment in multiple real-world scenarios. By thoroughly discussing the current challenges and future research directions, it also provides some important insights into multi-resource optimization in complex application environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamamd Zavid Parvez, Rafiqul Islam, Md Zahidul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: In a hyperconnected environment, medical institutions are particularly concerned with data privacy when sharing and transmitting sensitive patient information due to the risk of data breaches, where malicious actors could intercept sensitive information. A collaborative learning framework, including transfer, federated, and incremental learning, can generate efficient, secure, and scalable models while requiring less computation, maintaining patient data privacy, and ensuring an up-to-date model. This study aims to address the detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images through a proposed collaborative learning framework called CL3. Initially, transfer learning is employed, leveraging knowledge from a pre-trained model as the starting global model. Local models from different medical institutes are then integrated, and a new global model is constructed to adapt to any data drift observed in the local models. Additionally, incremental learning is considered, allowing continuous adaptation to new medical data without forgetting previously learned information. Experimental results demonstrate that the CL3 framework achieved a global accuracy of 89.99\% when using Xception with a batch size of 16 after being trained for six federated communication rounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stress has become a fact in people's lives. It has a significant effect on the function of body systems and many key systems of the body including respiratory, cardiovascular, and even reproductive systems are impacted by stress. It can be very helpful to detect stress episodes in early steps of its appearance to avoid damages it can cause to body systems. Using physiological signals can be useful for stress detection as they reflect very important information about the human body. PPG signal due to its advantages is one of the mostly used signal in this field. In this research work, we take advantage of PPG signals to detect stress events. The PPG signals used in this work are collected from one of the newest publicly available datasets named as UBFC-Phys and a model is developed by using CNN-MLP deep learning algorithm. The results obtained from the proposed model indicate that stress can be detected with an accuracy of approximately 82 percent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ittai Rubinstein, Samuel B. Hopkins</p>
<p>Abstract: It has recently been discovered that the conclusions of many highly influential econometrics studies can be overturned by removing a very small fraction of their samples (often less than $0.5\%$). These conclusions are typically based on the results of one or more Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions, raising the question: given a dataset, can we certify the robustness of an OLS fit on this dataset to the removal of a given number of samples?
  Brute-force techniques quickly break down even on small datasets. Existing approaches which go beyond brute force either can only find candidate small subsets to remove (but cannot certify their non-existence) [BGM20, KZC21], are computationally intractable beyond low dimensional settings [MR22], or require very strong assumptions on the data distribution and too many samples to give reasonable bounds in practice [BP21, FH23].
  We present an efficient algorithm for certifying the robustness of linear regressions to removals of samples. We implement our algorithm and run it on several landmark econometrics datasets with hundreds of dimensions and tens of thousands of samples, giving the first non-trivial certificates of robustness to sample removal for datasets of dimension $4$ or greater. We prove that under distributional assumptions on a dataset, the bounds produced by our algorithm are tight up to a $1 + o(1)$ multiplicative factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Khajooeinejad, Masoumeh Chapariniya</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) effectively tackles complex tasks by decomposing them into structured policies. However, HRL agents often face challenges with efficient exploration and rapid adaptation. To address this, we integrate meta-learning into HRL to enhance the agent's ability to learn and adapt hierarchical policies swiftly. Our approach employs meta-learning for rapid task adaptation based on prior experience, while intrinsic motivation mechanisms encourage efficient exploration by rewarding novel state visits. Specifically, our agent uses a high-level policy to select among multiple low-level policies operating within custom grid environments. We utilize gradient-based meta-learning with differentiable inner-loop updates, enabling optimization across a curriculum of increasingly difficult tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our meta-learned hierarchical agent significantly outperforms traditional HRL agents without meta-learning and intrinsic motivation. The agent exhibits accelerated learning, higher cumulative rewards, and improved success rates in complex grid environments. These findings suggest that integrating meta-learning with HRL, alongside curriculum learning and intrinsic motivation, substantially enhances the agent's capability to handle complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Yan, Yan Song, Xidong Feng, Mengyue Yang, Haifeng Zhang, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks, methods like reinforcement learning (RL) and heuristic search have made notable advances in specific cases. However, they often require extensive exploration and face challenges in generalizing across diverse environments due to their limited grasp of the underlying decision dynamics. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful general-purpose tools, due to their capacity to maintain vast amounts of domain-specific knowledge. To harness this rich prior knowledge for efficiently solving complex SDM tasks, we propose treating LLMs as prior action distributions and integrating them into RL frameworks through Bayesian inference methods, making use of variational inference and direct posterior sampling. The proposed approaches facilitate the seamless incorporation of fixed LLM priors into both policy-based and value-based RL frameworks. Our experiments show that incorporating LLM-based action priors significantly reduces exploration and optimization complexity, substantially improving sample efficiency compared to traditional RL techniques, e.g., using LLM priors decreases the number of required samples by over 90% in offline learning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carolin Schmidt, Daniele Gammelli, James Harrison, Marco Pavone, Filipe Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge. Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms. In this work, we propose OHIO: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the inverse problem, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy. This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training. We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness. We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Carrow, Kyle Harper Erwin, Olga Vilenskaia, Parikshit Ram, Tim Klinger, Naweed Aghmad Khan, Ndivhuwo Makondo, Alexander Gray</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to a surge in adoption of neural networks for various tasks, but lack of interpretability remains an issue for many others in which an understanding of the features influencing the prediction is necessary to ensure fairness, safety, and legal compliance. In this paper we consider one class of such tasks, tabular dataset classification, and propose a novel neuro-symbolic architecture, Neural Reasoning Networks (NRN), that is scalable and generates logically sound textual explanations for its predictions. NRNs are connected layers of logical neurons which implement a form of real valued logic. A training algorithm (R-NRN) learns the weights of the network as usual using gradient descent optimization with backprop, but also learns the network structure itself using a bandit-based optimization. Both are implemented in an extension to PyTorch (https://github.com/IBM/torchlogic) that takes full advantage of GPU scaling and batched training. Evaluation on a diverse set of 22 open-source datasets for tabular classification demonstrates performance (measured by ROC AUC) which improves over multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and is statistically similar to other state-of-the-art approaches such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Gradient Boosted Trees, while offering 43% faster training and a more than 2 orders of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters required, on average. Furthermore, R-NRN explanations are shorter than the compared approaches while producing more accurate feature importance scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Gao, Eike Eberhard, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks. EG-XC combines semi-local functionals with a non-local feature density parametrized by an equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud representation of the electron density to capture long-range interactions. By differentiating through a self-consistent field solver, we train EG-XC requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanqi Du, Michael Plainer, Rob Brekelmans, Chenru Duan, Frank No\'e, Carla P. Gomes, Alan Apsuru-Guzik, Kirill Neklyudov</p>
<p>Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Manolache, Dragos Tantaru, Mathias Niepert</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple transformer-based baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning, integrating three distinct modalities: SMILES strings, 2D graph representations, and 3D conformers of molecules. A key aspect of our approach is the aggregation of 3D conformers, allowing the model to account for the fact that molecules can adopt multiple conformations-an important factor for accurate molecular representation. The tokens for each modality are extracted using modality-specific encoders: a transformer for SMILES strings, a message-passing neural network for 2D graphs, and an equivariant neural network for 3D conformers. The flexibility and modularity of this framework enable easy adaptation and replacement of these encoders, making the model highly versatile for different molecular tasks. The extracted tokens are then combined into a unified multimodal sequence, which is processed by a downstream transformer for prediction tasks. To efficiently scale our model for large multimodal datasets, we utilize Flash Attention 2 and bfloat16 precision. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness as a strong baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashun Liu, Johan Obando-Ceron, Aaron Courville, Ling Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, Neuroplastic Expansion (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (1) elastic neuron generation based on potential gradients, (2) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (3) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyue Bai, Jifan Zhang, Robert Nowak</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning models deployed often encounter distribution shifts in real-world applications, manifesting as covariate or semantic out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. These shifts give rise to challenges in OOD generalization and OOD detection. This paper introduces a novel, integrated approach AHA (Adaptive Human-Assisted OOD learning) to simultaneously address both OOD generalization and detection through a human-assisted framework by labeling data in the wild. Our approach strategically labels examples within a novel maximum disambiguation region, where the number of semantic and covariate OOD data roughly equalizes. By labeling within this region, we can maximally disambiguate the two types of OOD data, thereby maximizing the utility of the fixed labeling budget. Our algorithm first utilizes a noisy binary search algorithm that identifies the maximal disambiguation region with high probability. The algorithm then continues with annotating inside the identified labeling region, reaping the full benefit of human feedback. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our framework. We observed that with only a few hundred human annotations, our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that do not involve human assistance, in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08003">More Experts Than Galaxies: Conditionally-overlapping Experts With Biologically-Inspired Fixed Routing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Shaier, Francisco Pereira, Katharina von der Wense, Lawrence E Hunter, Matt Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of biological neural systems has led to both modularity and sparse coding, which enables efficiency in energy usage, and robustness across the diversity of tasks in the lifespan. In contrast, standard neural networks rely on dense, non-specialized architectures, where all model parameters are simultaneously updated to learn multiple tasks, leading to representation interference. Current sparse neural network approaches aim to alleviate this issue, but are often hindered by limitations such as 1) trainable gating functions that cause representation collapse; 2) non-overlapping experts that result in redundant computation and slow learning; and 3) reliance on explicit input or task IDs that impose significant constraints on flexibility and scalability. In this paper we propose Conditionally Overlapping Mixture of ExperTs (COMET), a general deep learning method that addresses these challenges by inducing a modular, sparse architecture with an exponential number of overlapping experts. COMET replaces the trainable gating function used in Sparse Mixture of Experts with a fixed, biologically inspired random projection applied to individual input representations. This design causes the degree of expert overlap to depend on input similarity, so that similar inputs tend to share more parameters. This facilitates positive knowledge transfer, resulting in faster learning and improved generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and regression, using several popular deep learning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni De Toni, Stefano Teso, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse (AR) aims to provide users with actionable steps to overturn unfavourable decisions made by machine learning predictors. However, these actions often take time to implement (e.g., getting a degree can take years), and their effects may vary as the world evolves. Thus, it is natural to ask for recourse that remains valid in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we study the robustness of algorithmic recourse over time by casting the problem through the lens of causality. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that (even robust) causal AR methods can fail over time except in the - unlikely - case that the world is stationary. Even more critically, unless the world is fully deterministic, counterfactual AR cannot be solved optimally. To account for this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for temporal AR that explicitly accounts for time. Our simulations on synthetic and realistic datasets show how considering time produces more resilient solutions to potential trends in the data distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruyi Ding, Lili Su, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), developed from extensive datasets to integrate multifaceted knowledge, are increasingly recognized as valuable intellectual property (IP). To safeguard these models against IP infringement, strategies for ownership verification and usage authorization have emerged. Unlike most existing IP protection strategies that concentrate on restricting direct access to the model, our study addresses an extended DNN IP issue: applicability authorization, aiming to prevent the misuse of learned knowledge, particularly in unauthorized transfer learning scenarios. We propose Non-Transferable Pruning (NTP), a novel IP protection method that leverages model pruning to control a pretrained DNN's transferability to unauthorized data domains. Selective pruning can deliberately diminish a model's suitability on unauthorized domains, even with full fine-tuning. Specifically, our framework employs the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for optimizing both the model sparsity and an innovative non-transferable learning loss, augmented with Fisher space discriminative regularization, to constrain the model's generalizability to the target dataset. We also propose a novel effective metric to measure the model non-transferability: Area Under the Sample-wise Learning Curve (SLC-AUC). This metric facilitates consideration of full fine-tuning across various sample sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that NTP significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art non-transferable learning methods, with an average SLC-AUC at $-0.54$ across diverse pairs of source and target domains, indicating that models trained with NTP do not suit for transfer learning to unauthorized target domains. The efficacy of NTP is validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning contexts, confirming its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas H\"ubotter, Sascha Bongni, Ido Hakimi, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate the impact of pretraining Graph Transformer architectures on atom-level quantum-mechanical features for the modeling of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug-like compounds. We compare this pretraining strategy with two others: one based on molecular quantum properties (specifically the HOMO-LUMO gap) and one using a self-supervised atom masking technique. After fine-tuning on Therapeutic Data Commons ADMET datasets, we evaluate the performance improvement in the different models observing that models pretrained with atomic quantum mechanical properties produce in general better results. We then analyse the latent representations and observe that the supervised strategies preserve the pretraining information after finetuning and that different pretrainings produce different trends in latent expressivity across layers. Furthermore, we find that models pretrained on atomic quantum mechanical properties capture more low-frequency laplacian eigenmodes of the input graph via the attention weights and produce better representations of atomic environments within the molecule. Application of the analysis to a much larger non-public dataset for microsomal clearance illustrates generalizability of the studied indicators. In this case the performances of the models are in accordance with the representation analysis and highlight, especially for the case of masking pretraining and atom-level quantum property pretraining, how model types with similar performance on public benchmarks can have different performances on large scale pharmaceutical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianyang Zhang, Huijuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human learning thrives on the ability to learn from mistakes, adapt through feedback, and refine understanding-processes often missing in static machine learning models. In this work, we introduce Composite Learning Units (CLUs) designed to transform reasoners, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), into learners capable of generalized, continuous learning without conventional parameter updates while enhancing their reasoning abilities through continual interaction and feedback. CLUs are built on an architecture that allows a reasoning model to maintain and evolve a dynamic knowledge repository: a General Knowledge Space for broad, reusable insights and a Prompt-Specific Knowledge Space for task-specific learning. Through goal-driven interactions, CLUs iteratively refine these knowledge spaces, enabling the system to adapt dynamically to complex tasks, extract nuanced insights, and build upon past experiences autonomously. We demonstrate CLUs' effectiveness through a cryptographic reasoning task, where they continuously evolve their understanding through feedback to uncover hidden transformation rules. While conventional models struggle to grasp underlying logic, CLUs excel by engaging in an iterative, goal-oriented process. Specialized components-handling knowledge retrieval, prompt generation, and feedback analysis-work together within a reinforcing feedback loop. This approach allows CLUs to retain the memory of past failures and successes, adapt autonomously, and apply sophisticated reasoning effectively, continually learning from mistakes while also building on breakthroughs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), a recently proposed neural network architecture, have gained significant attention in the deep learning community, due to their potential as a viable alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and their broad applicability to various scientific tasks. Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.</p>

However, current verifier models in LLMs often rely on supervised fine-tuning without temporal difference learning such as Q-learning. This paper introduces VerifierQ, a novel approach that integrates Offline Q-learning into LLM verifier models. We address three key challenges in applying Q-learning to LLMs: (1) handling utterance-level Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), (2) managing large action spaces, and (3) mitigating overestimation bias. VerifierQ introduces a modified Bellman update for bounded Q-values, incorporates Implicit Q-learning (IQL) for efficient action space management, and integrates a novel Conservative Q-learning (CQL) formulation for balanced Q-value estimation. Our method enables parallel Q-value computation and improving training efficiency. While recent work has explored RL techniques like MCTS for generators, VerifierQ is among the first to investigate the verifier (critic) aspect in LLMs through Q-learning. This integration of RL principles into verifier models complements existing advancements in generator techniques, potentially enabling more robust and adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate VerifierQ's superior performance compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches, with improvements in efficiency, accuracy and robustness. By enhancing the synergy between generation and evaluation capabilities, VerifierQ contributes to the ongoing evolution of AI systems in addressing complex cognitive tasks across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Boyi Liu, Yufeng Zhang, Yingxiang Yang, Yongfei Liu, Liyu Chen, Tao Sun, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models. Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks. When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching Lam Choi, Alexandre Duplessis, Serge Belongie</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based interpretations often require an anchor point of comparison to avoid saturation in computing feature importance. We show that current baselines defined using static functions--constant mapping, averaging or blurring--inject harmful colour, texture or frequency assumptions that deviate from model behaviour. This leads to accumulation of irregular gradients, resulting in attribution maps that are biased, fragile and manipulable. Departing from the static approach, we propose UNI to compute an (un)learnable, debiased and adaptive baseline by perturbing the input towards an unlearning direction of steepest ascent. Our method discovers reliable baselines and succeeds in erasing salient features, which in turn locally smooths the high-curvature decision boundaries. Our analyses point to unlearning as a promising avenue for generating faithful, efficient and robust interpretations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiwo A. Adebiyi, Bach Do, Ruda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a simple, effective stochastic policy in Bayesian decision making. It samples the posterior belief about the reward profile and optimizes the sample to obtain a candidate decision. In continuous optimization, the posterior of the objective function is often a Gaussian process (GP), whose sample paths have numerous local optima, making their global optimization challenging. In this work, we introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for GP-TS that carefully selects starting points for gradient-based multi-start optimizers. It identifies all local optima of the prior sample via univariate global rootfinding, and optimizes the posterior sample using a differentiable, decoupled representation. We demonstrate remarkable improvement in the global optimization of GP posterior samples, especially in high dimensions. This leads to dramatic improvements in the overall performance of Bayesian optimization using GP-TS acquisition functions, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like GP-UCB and EI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinith M. Suriyakumar, Rohan Alur, Ayush Sekhari, Manish Raghavan, Ashia C. Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "mass concept erasure" (the current state of the art for unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models (Lu et al., 2024)) with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Guoyin Wang, Jiwei Li, Eduard Hovy, Chen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length. Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.
  In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B. This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios. Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tycho F. A. van der Ouderaa, Mark van der Wilk, Pim de Haan</p>
<p>Abstract: Symmetries have proven useful in machine learning models, improving generalisation and overall performance. At the same time, recent advancements in learning dynamical systems rely on modelling the underlying Hamiltonian to guarantee the conservation of energy. These approaches can be connected via a seminal result in mathematical physics: Noether's theorem, which states that symmetries in a dynamical system correspond to conserved quantities. This work uses Noether's theorem to parameterise symmetries as learnable conserved quantities. We then allow conserved quantities and associated symmetries to be learned directly from train data through approximate Bayesian model selection, jointly with the regular training procedure. As training objective, we derive a variational lower bound to the marginal likelihood. The objective automatically embodies an Occam's Razor effect that avoids collapse of conservation laws to the trivial constant, without the need to manually add and tune additional regularisers. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle on $n$-harmonic oscillators and $n$-body systems. We find that our method correctly identifies the correct conserved quantities and U($n$) and SE($n$) symmetry groups, improving overall performance and predictive accuracy on test data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayoub Ajarra, Bishwamittra Ghosh, Debabrota Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the pervasive deployment of Machine Learning (ML) models in real-world applications, verifying and auditing properties of ML models have become a central concern. In this work, we focus on three properties: robustness, individual fairness, and group fairness. We discuss two approaches for auditing ML model properties: estimation with and without reconstruction of the target model under audit. Though the first approach is studied in the literature, the second approach remains unexplored. For this purpose, we develop a new framework that quantifies different properties in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the ML model under audit but does not parametrically reconstruct it. We propose the Active Fourier Auditor (AFA), which queries sample points according to the Fourier coefficients of the ML model, and further estimates the properties. We derive high probability error bounds on AFA's estimates, along with the worst-case lower bounds on the sample complexity to audit them. Numerically we demonstrate on multiple datasets and models that AFA is more accurate and sample-efficient to estimate the properties of interest than the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngoc-Hai Nguyen, Dung Le, Hoang-Phi Nguyen, Tung Pham, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore a robust version of the barycenter problem among $n$ centered Gaussian probability measures, termed Semi-Unbalanced Optimal Transport (SUOT)-based Barycenter, wherein the barycenter remains fixed while the others are relaxed using Kullback-Leibler divergence. We develop optimization algorithms on Bures-Wasserstein manifold, named the Exact Geodesic Gradient Descent and Hybrid Gradient Descent algorithms. While the Exact Geodesic Gradient Descent method is based on computing the exact closed form of the first-order derivative of the objective function of the barycenter along a geodesic on the Bures manifold, the Hybrid Gradient Descent method utilizes optimizer components when solving the SUOT problem to replace outlier measures before applying the Riemannian Gradient Descent. We establish the theoretical convergence guarantees for both methods and demonstrate that the Exact Geodesic Gradient Descent algorithm attains a dimension-free convergence rate. Finally, we conduct experiments to compare the normal Wasserstein Barycenter with ours and perform an ablation study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moirangthem Tiken Singh, Rabinder Kumar Prasad, Gurumayum Robert Michael, N K Kaphungkui, N. Hemarjit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The digital revolution has significantly impacted financial transactions, leading to a notable increase in credit card usage. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off: a substantial rise in fraudulent activities. Traditional machine learning methods for fraud detection often struggle to capture the inherent interconnectedness within financial data. This paper proposes a novel approach for credit card fraud detection that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms applied to heterogeneous graph representations of financial data. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs capture intricate relationships between various entities in the financial ecosystem, such as cardholders, merchants, and transactions, providing a richer and more comprehensive data representation for fraud analysis. To address the inherent class imbalance in fraud data, where genuine transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones, the proposed approach integrates an autoencoder. This autoencoder, trained on genuine transactions, learns a latent representation and flags deviations during reconstruction as potential fraud. This research investigates two key questions: (1) How effectively can a GNN with an attention mechanism detect and prevent credit card fraud when applied to a heterogeneous graph? (2) How does the efficacy of the autoencoder with attention approach compare to traditional methods? The results are promising, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms benchmark algorithms such as Graph Sage and FI-GRL, achieving a superior AUC-PR of 0.89 and an F1-score of 0.81. This research significantly advances fraud detection systems and the overall security of financial transactions by leveraging GNNs with attention mechanisms and addressing class imbalance through an autoencoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: We deal with the problem of gradient estimation for stochastic differentiable relaxations of algorithms, operators, simulators, and other non-differentiable functions. Stochastic smoothing conventionally perturbs the input of a non-differentiable function with a differentiable density distribution with full support, smoothing it and enabling gradient estimation. Our theory starts at first principles to derive stochastic smoothing with reduced assumptions, without requiring a differentiable density nor full support, and we present a general framework for relaxation and gradient estimation of non-differentiable black-box functions $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$. We develop variance reduction for gradient estimation from 3 orthogonal perspectives. Empirically, we benchmark 6 distributions and up to 24 variance reduction strategies for differentiable sorting and ranking, differentiable shortest-paths on graphs, differentiable rendering for pose estimation, as well as differentiable cryo-ET simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojuan Tang, Jiaqi Li, Yitao Liang, Song-chun Zhu, Muhan Zhang, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable success in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored knowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \textit{situated inductive reasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper, we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings, derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we explore \textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in an adaptive and context-sensitive way.</p>

In contrast to conventional static prompting methods, Dynamic Prompting enables the adaptive modification of prompt sequences and step counts based on real-time task complexity and model performance. This dynamic adaptation facilitates more efficient problem-solving, particularly in smaller models, by reducing hallucinations and repetitive cycles.

<p>Abstract: Generative modeling of discrete data underlies important applications spanning text-based agents like ChatGPT to the design of the very building blocks of life in protein sequences. However, application domains need to exert control over the generated data by steering the generative process - typically via RLHF - to satisfy a specified property, reward, or affinity metric. In this paper, we study the problem of steering Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), a recent class of discrete diffusion models that offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models. We introduce Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction (DDPP), a novel framework that casts the task of steering pre-trained MDMs as a problem of probabilistic inference by learning to sample from a target Bayesian posterior. Our DDPP framework leads to a family of three novel objectives that are all simulation-free, and thus scalable while applying to general non-differentiable reward functions. Empirically, we instantiate DDPP by steering MDMs to perform class-conditional pixel-level image modeling, RLHF-based alignment of MDMs using text-based rewards, and finetuning protein language models to generate more diverse secondary structures and shorter proteins. We substantiate our designs via wet-lab validation, where we observe transient expression of reward-optimized protein sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrith Setlur, Chirag Nagpal, Adam Fisch, Xinyang Geng, Jacob Eisenstein, Rishabh Agarwal, Alekh Agarwal, Jonathan Berant, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: A promising approach for improving reasoning in large language models is to use process reward models (PRMs). PRMs provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. To improve a base policy by running search against a PRM or using it as dense rewards for reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: "How should we design process rewards?". Our key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a step should measure progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct response in the future, before and after taking the step, corresponding to the notion of step-level advantages in RL. Crucially, this progress should be measured under a prover policy distinct from the base policy. We theoretically characterize the set of good provers and our results show that optimizing process rewards from such provers improves exploration during test-time search and online RL. In fact, our characterization shows that weak prover policies can substantially improve a stronger base policy, which we also observe empirically. We validate our claims by training process advantage verifiers (PAVs) to predict progress under such provers, and show that compared to ORMs, test-time search against PAVs is $>8\%$ more accurate, and $1.5-5\times$ more compute-efficient. Online RL with dense rewards from PAVs enables one of the first results with $5-6\times$ gain in sample efficiency, and $>6\%$ gain in accuracy, over ORMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryo Lotfi, Enrico Fini, Samy Bengio, Moin Nabi, Emmanuel Abbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in solving tasks that require more global reasoning, where local features offer no significant information. These tasks are reminiscent of the connectivity tasks discussed by Minsky and Papert in 1969, which exposed the limitations of the perceptron model and contributed to the first AI winter. In this paper, we revisit such tasks by introducing four global visual benchmarks involving path findings and mazes. We show that: (1) although today's large vision models largely surpass the expressivity limitations of the early models, they still struggle with the learning efficiency; we put forward the "globality degree" notion to understand this limitation; (2) we then demonstrate that the picture changes and global reasoning becomes feasible with the introduction of "visual scratchpads"; similarly to the text scratchpads and chain-of-thoughts used in language models, visual scratchpads help break down global tasks into simpler ones; (3) we finally show that some scratchpads are better than others, in particular, "inductive scratchpads" that take steps relying on less information afford better out-of-distribution generalization and succeed for smaller model sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adam outperforms SGD when training language models. Yet this advantage is not well-understood theoretically -- previous convergence analysis for Adam and SGD mainly focuses on the number of steps $T$ and is already minimax-optimal in non-convex cases, which are both $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$. In this work, we argue that the exploitation of nice $\ell_\infty$-geometry is the key advantage of Adam over SGD. More specifically, we give a new convergence analysis for Adam under novel assumptions that loss is smooth under $\ell_\infty$-geometry rather than the more common $\ell_2$-geometry, which yields a much better empirical smoothness constant for GPT-2 and ResNet models. Our experiments confirm that Adam performs much worse when the favorable $\ell_\infty$-geometry is changed while SGD provably remains unaffected. We also extend the convergence analysis to blockwise Adam under novel blockwise smoothness assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Mudide, Joshua Engels, Eric J. Michaud, Max Tegmark, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a recent technique for decomposing neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, in order for SAEs to identify all features represented in frontier models, it will be necessary to scale them up to very high width, posing a computational challenge. In this work, we introduce Switch Sparse Autoencoders, a novel SAE architecture aimed at reducing the compute cost of training SAEs. Inspired by sparse mixture of experts models, Switch SAEs route activation vectors between smaller "expert" SAEs, enabling SAEs to efficiently scale to many more features. We present experiments comparing Switch SAEs with other SAE architectures, and find that Switch SAEs deliver a substantial Pareto improvement in the reconstruction vs. sparsity frontier for a given fixed training compute budget. We also study the geometry of features across experts, analyze features duplicated across experts, and verify that Switch SAE features are as interpretable as features found by other SAE architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Sonboli, Sipei Li, Mehdi Elahi, Asia Biega</p>
<p>Abstract: General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) aim to safeguard individuals' personal information from harm. While full compliance is mandatory in the European Union and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), it is not in other places. GDPR requires simultaneous compliance with all the principles such as fairness, accuracy, and data minimization. However, it overlooks the potential contradictions within its principles. This matter gets even more complex when compliance is required from decision-making systems. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the feasibility of simultaneously achieving the goals of GDPR and machine learning, and the potential tradeoffs that might be forced upon us. This paper studies the relationship between the principles of data minimization and fairness in recommender systems. We operationalize data minimization via active learning (AL) because, unlike many other methods, it can preserve a high accuracy while allowing for strategic data collection, hence minimizing the amount of data collection. We have implemented several active learning strategies (personalized and non-personalized) and conducted a comparative analysis focusing on accuracy and fairness on two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that different AL strategies may have different impacts on the accuracy of recommender systems with nearly all strategies negatively impacting fairness. There has been no to very limited work on the trade-off between data minimization and fairness, the pros and cons of active learning methods as tools for implementing data minimization, and the potential impacts of AL on fairness. By exploring these critical aspects, we offer valuable insights for developing recommender systems that are GDPR compliant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Goene, Siamak Mehrkanoon</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the novel Dual Stream Graph-Transformer Fusion (DS-GTF) architecture designed specifically for classifying task-based Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In the spatial stream, inputs are initially represented as graphs, which are then passed through graph attention networks (GAT) to extract spatial patterns. Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Bary, Benoit Macq</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer neural networks require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively. Such data is often scarce in electroencephalography, as annotations made by medical experts are costly. This is why self-supervised training, using unlabeled data, has to be performed beforehand. In this paper, we present a way to design several labeled datasets from unlabeled electroencephalogram (EEG) data. These can then be used to pre-train transformers to learn representations of EEG signals. We tested this method on an epileptic seizure forecasting task on the Temple University Seizure Detection Corpus using a Multi-channel Vision Transformer. Our results suggest that 1) Models pre-trained using our approach demonstrate significantly faster training times, reducing fine-tuning duration by more than 50% for the specific task, and 2) Pre-trained models exhibit improved accuracy, with an increase from 90.93% to 92.16%, as well as a higher AUC, rising from 0.9648 to 0.9702 when compared to non-pre-trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Ahmadi, Ray Mercurius, Soheil Alizadeh, Kasra Rezaee, Amir Rasouli</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiyaan Arfeen, Zhen Zhang, Xinwei Fu, Gregory R. Ganger, Yida Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with billions of parameters generally involves pipeline-parallel (PP) execution. Unfortunately, PP model training can use GPUs inefficiently, especially at large scale, due to idle GPU time caused by pipeline bubbles, which are often 15-30% and can exceed 60% of the training job's GPU allocation. To improve the GPU utilization of PP model training, this paper describes PipeFill, which fills pipeline bubbles with execution of other pending jobs. By leveraging bubble GPU time, PipeFill reduces the GPU utilization sacrifice associated with scaling-up of large-model training. To context-switch between fill jobs and the main training job with minimal overhead to the main job, and maximize fill job efficiency, PipeFill carefully fits fill job work to measured bubble durations and GPU memory availability, introduces explicit pipeline-bubble instructions, and orchestrates placement and execution of fill jobs in pipeline bubbles. Experiments show that PipeFill can increase overall utilization by up to 63% for GPUs used in large-scale LLM training, with <2% slowdown of the training job, and 5-15% even for low-scale LLM training. For large-scale LLM training on 8K GPUs, the 63% increase translates to up to 2.6K additional GPUs worth of work completed.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing number of dispersed EEG dataset publications and the advancement of large-scale Electroencephalogram (EEG) models have increased the demand for practical tools to manage diverse EEG datasets. However, the inherent complexity of EEG data, characterized by variability in content data, metadata, and data formats, poses challenges for integrating multiple datasets and conducting large-scale EEG model research. To tackle the challenges, this paper introduces EEGUnity, an open-source tool that incorporates modules of 'EEG Parser', 'Correction', 'Batch Processing', and 'Large Language Model Boost'. Leveraging the functionality of such modules, EEGUnity facilitates the efficient management of multiple EEG datasets, such as intelligent data structure inference, data cleaning, and data unification. In addition, the capabilities of EEGUnity ensure high data quality and consistency, providing a reliable foundation for large-scale EEG data research. EEGUnity is evaluated across 25 EEG datasets from different sources, offering several typical batch processing workflows. The results demonstrate the high performance and flexibility of EEGUnity in parsing and data processing. The project code is publicly available at github.com/Baizhige/EEGUnity.</p>

<p>Abstract: After an acute stroke, accurately estimating stroke severity is crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively manage patient's treatment. Graph theory methods have shown that brain connectivity undergoes frequency-dependent reorganization post-stroke, adapting to new conditions. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features that may not capture the complexities of clinical phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 71 patients at the time of hospitalization. For each patient, we generated five graphs weighted by Lagged Linear Coherence (LLC) between signals from distinct Brodmann Areas, covering $\delta$ (2-4 Hz), $\theta$ (4-8 Hz), $\alpha_1$ (8-10.5 Hz), $\alpha_2$ (10.5-13 Hz), and $\beta_1$ (13-20 Hz) frequency bands. To emphasize key neurological connections and maintain sparsity, we applied a sparsification process based on structural and functional brain network properties. We then trained a graph attention model to predict the NIHSS. By examining its attention coefficients, our model reveals insights into brain reconfiguration, providing clinicians with a valuable tool for diagnosis, personalized treatment, and early intervention in neurorehabilitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camila Gonz\'alez, Yanis Miraoui, Yiran Fan, Ehsan Adeli, Kilian M. Pohl</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning can help uncover patterns in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) associated with psychiatric disorders and personal traits. Yet the problem of interpreting deep learning findings is rarely more evident than in fMRI analyses, as the data is sensitive to scanning effects and inherently difficult to visualize. We propose a simple approach to mitigate these challenges grounded on sparsification and self-supervision. Instead of extracting post-hoc feature attributions to uncover functional connections that are important to the target task, we identify a small subset of highly informative connections during training and occlude the rest. To this end, we jointly train a (1) sparse input mask, (2) variational autoencoder (VAE), and (3) downstream classifier in an end-to-end fashion. While we need a portion of labeled samples to train the classifier, we optimize the sparse mask and VAE with unlabeled data from additional acquisition sites, retaining only the input features that generalize well. We evaluate our method - Sparsely Reconstructed Graphs (SpaRG) - on the public ABIDE dataset for the task of sex classification, training with labeled cases from 18 sites and adapting the model to two additional out-of-distribution sites with a portion of unlabeled samples. For a relatively coarse parcellation (64 regions), SpaRG utilizes only 1% of the original connections while improving the classification accuracy across domains. Our code can be found at github.com/yanismiraoui/SpaRG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rumeshika Pallewela, Eslam Eldeeb, Hirley Alves</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion as an advanced information-theoretic loss function tailored for deep learning applications in wireless communications. The MEE criterion leverages higher-order statistical properties, offering robustness in noisy scenarios like Rayleigh fading and impulsive interference. In addition, we propose a less computationally complex version of the MEE function to enhance practical usability in wireless communications. The method is evaluated through simulations on two critical applications: over-the-air regression and indoor localization. Results indicate that the MEE criterion outperforms conventional loss functions, such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), achieving significant performance improvements in terms of accuracy, over $20 \%$ gain over traditional methods, and convergence speed across various channel conditions. This work establishes MEE as a promising alternative for wireless communication tasks in deep learning models, enabling better resilience and adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating visually appealing composites requires optimizing both text and background for compatibility. Previous methods have focused on simple design strategies, such as changing text color or adding background shapes for contrast. These approaches are often destructive, altering text color or partially obstructing the background image. Another method involves placing design elements in non-salient and contrasting regions, but this isn't always effective, especially with patterned backgrounds. To address these challenges, we propose a generative approach using a diffusion model. This method ensures the altered regions beneath design assets exhibit low saliency while enhancing contrast, thereby improving the visibility of the design asset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jake Callahan, Kevin Monogue, Ruben Villarreal, Tommie Catanach</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring networks increasingly aim to assimilate data from a large number of diverse sensors covering many sensing modalities. Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks to identify data, sensor configurations, or experiments which can optimally reduce uncertainty and hence increase the performance of a monitoring network. Information theory guides OED by formulating the choice of experiment or sensor placement as an optimization problem that maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) about quantities of interest given prior knowledge and models of expected observation data. Therefore, within the context of seismo-acoustic monitoring, we can use Bayesian OED to configure sensor networks by choosing sensor locations, types, and fidelity in order to improve our ability to identify and locate seismic sources. In this work, we develop the framework necessary to use Bayesian OED to optimize a sensor network's ability to locate seismic events from arrival time data of detected seismic phases at the regional-scale. Bayesian OED requires four elements:
  1) A likelihood function that describes the distribution of detection and travel time data from the sensor network,
  2) A Bayesian solver that uses a prior and likelihood to identify the posterior distribution of seismic events given the data,
  3) An algorithm to compute EIG about seismic events over a dataset of hypothetical prior events,
  4) An optimizer that finds a sensor network which maximizes EIG.
  Once we have developed this framework, we explore many relevant questions to monitoring such as: how to trade off sensor fidelity and earth model uncertainty; how sensor types, number, and locations influence uncertainty; and how prior models and constraints influence sensor placement.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07216">Evaluating Financial Relational Graphs: Interpretation Before Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjie Niu, Lanxin Lu, Rian Dolphin, Valerio Poti, Ruihai Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and robust stock trend forecasting has been a crucial and challenging task, as stock price changes are influenced by multiple factors. Graph neural network-based methods have recently achieved remarkable success in this domain by constructing stock relationship graphs that reflect internal factors and relationships between stocks. However, most of these methods rely on predefined factors to construct static stock relationship graphs due to the lack of suitable datasets, failing to capture the dynamic changes in stock relationships. Moreover, the evaluation of relationship graphs in these methods is often tied to the performance of neural network models on downstream tasks, leading to confusion and imprecision. To address these issues, we introduce the SPNews dataset, collected based on S\&P 500 Index stocks, to facilitate the construction of dynamic relationship graphs. Furthermore, we propose a novel set of financial relationship graph evaluation methods that are independent of downstream tasks. By using the relationship graph to explain historical financial phenomena, we assess its validity before constructing a graph neural network, ensuring the graph's effectiveness in capturing relevant financial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our evaluation methods can effectively differentiate between various financial relationship graphs, yielding more interpretable results compared to traditional approaches. We make our source code publicly available on GitHub to promote reproducibility and further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Opeyemi Sheu Alamu, Md Kamrul Siam</p>
<p>Abstract: A comparative analysis of deep learning models and traditional statistical methods for stock price prediction uses data from the Nigerian stock exchange. Historical data, including daily prices and trading volumes, are employed to implement models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). These models are assessed over three-time horizons: short-term (1 year), medium-term (2.5 years), and long-term (5 years), with performance measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The stability of the time series is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Results reveal that deep learning models, particularly LSTM, outperform traditional methods by capturing complex, nonlinear patterns in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions. However, these models require greater computational resources and offer less interpretability than traditional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning for improving financial forecasting and investment strategies. Future research could incorporate external factors such as social media sentiment and economic indicators, refine model architectures, and explore real-time applications to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiying Hou, Chenshu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning shows promising performance in wireless sensing. However, deep wireless sensing (DWS) heavily relies on large datasets. Unfortunately, building comprehensive datasets for DWS is difficult and costly, because wireless data depends on environmental factors and cannot be labeled offline. Despite recent advances in few-shot/cross-domain learning, DWS is still facing data scarcity issues. In this paper, we investigate a distinct perspective of radio data augmentation (RDA) for WiFi sensing and present a data-space solution. Our key insight is that wireless signals inherently exhibit data diversity, contributing more information to be extracted for DWS. We present RFBoost, a simple and effective RDA framework encompassing novel physical data augmentation techniques. We implement RFBoost as a plug-and-play module integrated with existing deep models and evaluate it on multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RFBoost achieves remarkable average accuracy improvements of 5.4% on existing models without additional data collection or model modifications, and the best-boosted performance outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baseline models without RDA. RFBoost pioneers the study of RDA, an important yet currently underexplored building block for DWS, which we expect to become a standard DWS component of WiFi sensing and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Vallarino</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model for stock price prediction by comparing it to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a linear regression model. The MoE framework combines an RNN for volatile stocks and a linear model for stable stocks, dynamically adjusting the weight of each model through a gating network. Results indicate that the MoE approach significantly improves predictive accuracy across different volatility profiles. The RNN effectively captures non-linear patterns for volatile companies but tends to overfit stable data, whereas the linear model performs well for predictable trends. The MoE model's adaptability allows it to outperform each individual model, reducing errors such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Future work should focus on enhancing the gating mechanism and validating the model with real-world datasets to optimize its practical applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gene expression analysis is a critical method for cancer classification, enabling precise diagnoses through the identification of unique molecular signatures associated with various tumors. Identifying cancer-specific genes from gene expression values enables a more tailored and personalized treatment approach. However, the high dimensionality of mRNA gene expression data poses challenges for analysis and data extraction. This research presents a comprehensive pipeline designed to accurately identify 33 distinct cancer types and their corresponding gene sets. It incorporates a combination of normalization and feature selection techniques to reduce dataset dimensionality effectively while ensuring high performance. Notably, our pipeline successfully identifies a substantial number of cancer-specific genes using a reduced feature set of just 500, in contrast to using the full dataset comprising 19,238 features. By employing an ensemble approach that combines three top-performing classifiers, a classification accuracy of 96.61% was achieved. Furthermore, we leverage Explainable AI to elucidate the biological significance of the identified cancer-specific genes, employing Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and moving towards multi-modal functionality. These models are increasingly integrated into diverse applications, impacting both research and industry. However, their development and deployment present substantial challenges, including the need for extensive computational resources, high energy consumption, and complex software optimizations. Unlike traditional deep learning systems, LLMs require unique optimization strategies for training and inference, focusing on system-level efficiency. This paper surveys hardware and software co-design approaches specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics and constraints of large language models. This survey analyzes the challenges and impacts of LLMs on hardware and algorithm research, exploring algorithm optimization, hardware design, and system-level innovations. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs and considerations in LLM-centric computing systems, guiding future advancements in AI. Finally, we summarize the existing efforts in this space and outline future directions toward realizing production-grade co-design methodologies for the next generation of large language models and AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nuclear radiation detectors based on scintillators are widely used in particle and high energy physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks are superior to traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation signal characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. By directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals without data embedding, including the zero-frequency component, adjusting convolution scheme for low-frequency components, and unbiasedly re-weighting features from different frequencies, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea on simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and on experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models without representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyikang Wang, Hubery Yin, Yuejiang Dong, Huminhao Zhu, Chao Zhang, Hanbin Zhao, Hui Qian, Chen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The inversion of diffusion model sampling, which aims to find the corresponding initial noise of a sample, plays a critical role in various tasks. Recently, several heuristic exact inversion samplers have been proposed to address the inexact inversion issue in a training-free manner. However, the theoretical properties of these heuristic samplers remain unknown and they often exhibit mediocre sampling quality. In this paper, we introduce a generic formulation, \emph{Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step} (BELM) samplers, of the exact inversion samplers, which includes all previously proposed heuristic exact inversion samplers as special cases. The BELM formulation is derived from the variable-stepsize-variable-formula linear multi-step method via integrating a bidirectional explicit constraint. We highlight this bidirectional explicit constraint is the key of mathematically exact inversion. We systematically investigate the Local Truncation Error (LTE) within the BELM framework and show that the existing heuristic designs of exact inversion samplers yield sub-optimal LTE. Consequently, we propose the Optimal BELM (O-BELM) sampler through the LTE minimization approach. We conduct additional analysis to substantiate the theoretical stability and global convergence property of the proposed optimal sampler. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our O-BELM sampler establishes the exact inversion property while achieving high-quality sampling. Additional experiments in image editing and image interpolation highlight the extensive potential of applying O-BELM in varying applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on non-verbal behavior generation for social interactive agents focuses mainly on the believability and synchronization of non-verbal cues with speech. However, existing models, predominantly based on deep learning architectures, often perpetuate biases inherent in the training data. This raises ethical concerns, depending on the intended application of these agents. This paper addresses these issues by first examining the influence of gender on facial non-verbal behaviors. We concentrate on gaze, head movements, and facial expressions. We introduce a classifier capable of discerning the gender of a speaker from their non-verbal cues. This classifier achieves high accuracy on both real behavior data, extracted using state-of-the-art tools, and synthetic data, generated from a model developed in previous work.Building upon this work, we present a new model, FairGenderGen, which integrates a gender discriminator and a gradient reversal layer into our previous behavior generation model. This new model generates facial non-verbal behaviors from speech features, mitigating gender sensitivity in the generated behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier, developed in the initial phase, is no longer effective in distinguishing the gender of the speaker from the generated non-verbal behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Ugare, Rohan Gumaste, Tarun Suresh, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks such as natural language and code generation. Still, their outputs often suffer from issues like privacy violations, and semantically inaccurate code generation. Current libraries for LLM generation rely on left-to-right decoding without systematic support for backtracking, limiting the ability to correct or refine outputs mid-generation. To address this issue, we introduce IterGen, an intuitive framework for iterative, grammar-guided LLM generation that enables users to move both forward and backward within the generated output based on grammar symbols. By leveraging a symbol-to-position mapping, IterGen ensures efficient and structured generation while allowing for corrections during the process. We demonstrate IterGen's effectiveness in two important applications: reducing privacy leakage in LLM outputs and improving the accuracy of LLM-generated SQL queries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Reed, Morteza Lahijanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Shielding is a common method used to guarantee the safety of a system under a black-box controller, such as a neural network controller from deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with simpler, verified controllers. Existing shielding methods rely on formal verification through Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), assuming either known or finite-state models, which limits their applicability to DRL settings with unknown, continuous-state systems. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a data-driven shielding methodology that guarantees safety for unknown systems under black-box controllers. The approach leverages Deep Kernel Learning to model the systems' one-step evolution with uncertainty quantification and constructs a finite-state abstraction as an Interval MDP (IMDP). By focusing on safety properties expressed in safe linear temporal logic (safe LTL), we develop an algorithm that computes the maximally permissive set of safe policies on the IMDP, ensuring avoidance of unsafe states. The algorithms soundness and computational complexity are demonstrated through theoretical proofs and experiments on nonlinear systems, including a high-dimensional autonomous spacecraft scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Erbas, Aporva Amarnath, Vikas Pandey, Karthik Swaminathan, Naigang Wang, Xavier Intes</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the biomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules, providing insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and ligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological processes, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in guided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally demanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing times, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI using an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with time-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the resource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The limited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient scheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models for low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a queue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task scheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based Seq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through knowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel, reducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels of parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x and 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the Seq2SeqLite model, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng-Meng Zhai, Bryan Glaz, Mulugeta Haile, Ying-Cheng Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing data-driven approaches to ecological systems for tasks such as state estimation and prediction is the paucity of the observational or measurement data. For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the ``dynamical climate'' of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, a three-species food chain, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness are achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Andres, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in environments where extrinsic rewards are sparse or non-existent. The recent rise of foundation models, such as CLIP, offers an opportunity to leverage pretrained, semantically rich embeddings that encapsulate broad and reusable knowledge. In this work we explore the potential of these foundation models not just to drive exploration, but also to analyze the critical role of the episodic novelty term in enhancing exploration effectiveness of the agent. We also investigate whether providing the intrinsic module with complete state information -- rather than just partial observations -- can improve exploration, despite the difficulties in handling small variations within large state spaces. Our experiments in the MiniGrid domain reveal that intrinsic modules can effectively utilize full state information, significantly increasing sample efficiency while learning an optimal policy. Moreover, we show that the embeddings provided by foundation models are sometimes even better than those constructed by the agent during training, further accelerating the learning process, especially when coupled with the episodic novelty term to enhance exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Remy, David Fridovich-Keil, Karen Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: From autonomous driving to package delivery, ensuring safe yet efficient multi-agent interaction is challenging as the interaction dynamics are influenced by hard-to-model factors such as social norms and contextual cues. Understanding these influences can aid in the design and evaluation of socially-aware autonomous agents whose behaviors are aligned with human values. In this work, we seek to codify factors governing safe multi-agent interactions via the lens of responsibility, i.e., an agent's willingness to deviate from their desired control to accommodate safe interaction with others. Specifically, we propose a data-driven modeling approach based on control barrier functions and differentiable optimization that efficiently learns agents' responsibility allocation from data. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that we can obtain an interpretable and quantitative understanding of how much agents adjust their behavior to ensure the safety of others given their current environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of end-to-end deep learning for robotic navigation, where the control signals are directly derived from raw sensory data.

We systematically analyze its performance on untrained tracks and computing requirements for real-time processing. We find that TinyLidarNet's 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture significantly outperforms widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suqi Liu, Tianxi Cai, Xiaoou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A large-scale knowledge graph enhances reproducibility in biomedical data discovery by providing a standardized, integrated framework that ensures consistent interpretation across diverse datasets. It improves generalizability by connecting data from various sources, enabling broader applicability of findings across different populations and conditions. Generating reliable knowledge graph, leveraging multi-source information from existing literature, however, is challenging especially with a large number of node sizes and heterogeneous relations. In this paper, we propose a general theoretically guaranteed statistical framework, called RENKI, to enable simultaneous learning of multiple relation types. RENKI generalizes various network models widely used in statistics and computer science. The proposed framework incorporates representation learning output into initial entity embedding of a neural network that approximates the score function for the knowledge graph and continuously trains the model to fit observed facts. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for in-sample and out-of-sample weighted MSEs in relation to the pseudo-dimension of the knowledge graph function class. Additionally, we provide pseudo-dimensions for score functions based on multilayer neural networks with ReLU activation function, in the scenarios when the embedding parameters either fixed or trainable. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical studies and apply the method to learn a comprehensive medical knowledge graph combining a pretrained language model representation with knowledge graph links observed in several medical ontologies. The experiments justify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effect of weighting in the presence of heterogeneous relations and the benefit of incorporating representation learning in nonparametric models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hafiz Tayyab Rauf, Alex Bogatu, Norman W. Paton, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Embeddings are now used to underpin a wide variety of data management tasks, including entity resolution, dataset search and semantic type detection. Such applications often involve datasets with numerical columns, but there has been more emphasis placed on the semantics of categorical data in embeddings than on the distinctive features of numerical data. In this paper, we propose a method called Gem (Gaussian mixture model embeddings) that creates embeddings that build on numerical value distributions from columns. The proposed method specializes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify and cluster columns with similar value distributions. We introduce a signature mechanism that generates a probability matrix for each column, indicating its likelihood of belonging to specific Gaussian components, which can be used for different applications, such as to determine semantic types. Finally, we generate embeddings for three numerical data properties: distributional, statistical, and contextual. Our core method focuses solely on numerical columns without using table names or neighboring columns for context. However, the method can be combined with other types of evidence, and we later integrate attribute names with the Gaussian embeddings to evaluate the method's contribution to improving overall performance. We compare Gem with several baseline methods for numeric only and numeric + context tasks, showing that Gem consistently outperforms the baselines on four benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dense Convolutional Network has been continuously refined to adopt a highly efficient and compact architecture, owing to its lightweight and efficient structure. However, the current Dense-like architectures are mainly designed manually, it becomes increasingly difficult to adjust the channels and reuse level based on past experience. As such, we propose an architecture search method called Dense Optimizer that can search high-performance dense-like network automatically. In Dense Optimizer, we view the dense network as a hierarchical information system, maximize the network's information entropy while constraining the distribution of the entropy across each stage via a power law, thereby constructing an optimization problem. We also propose a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm, tightly integrates power-law principle with search space scaling to solve the optimization problem efficiently. The superiority of Dense Optimizer has been validated on different computer vision benchmark datasets. Specifically, Dense Optimizer completes high-quality search but only costs 4 hours with one CPU. Our searched model DenseNet-OPT achieved a top 1 accuracy of 84.3% on CIFAR-100, which is 5.97% higher than the original one.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have set new benchmarks in few-shot learning across various tasks without needing task-specific fine-tuning. However, extensive research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of ICL is significantly influenced by the selection and ordering of demonstrations. Considering the critical role of demonstration selection in ICL, we introduce DemoShapley which is inspired by the Data Shapley valuation theorem. This approach assesses the influence of individual demonstration instances, distinguishing between those that contribute positively and those that may hinder performance. Our findings reveal that DemoShapley not only enhances model performance in terms of accuracy and fairness but also generalizes queries from domains distinct from those of the in-context demonstrations, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in optimizing ICL demonstration selection. Last but not least, DemoShapley demonstrates its ability to aid in identifying noisy data within the demonstration set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models.</p>

We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the gap-dependent bounds of two important algorithms for on-policy Q-learning for finite-horizon episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): UCB-Advantage (Zhang et al. 2020) and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage (Li et al. 2021). UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage improve upon the results based on Hoeffding-type bonuses and achieve the almost optimal $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bound in the worst-case scenario, where $T$ is the total number of steps. However, the benign structures of the MDPs such as a strictly positive suboptimality gap can significantly improve the regret. While gap-dependent regret bounds have been obtained for Q-learning with Hoeffding-type bonuses, it remains an open question to establish gap-dependent regret bounds for Q-learning using variance estimators in their bonuses and reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction. We develop a novel error decomposition framework to prove gap-dependent regret bounds of UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage that are logarithmic in $T$ and improve upon existing ones for Q-learning algorithms. Moreover, we establish the gap-dependent bound for the policy switching cost of UCB-Advantage and improve that under the worst-case MDPs. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first gap-dependent regret analysis for Q-learning using variance estimators and reference-advantage decomposition and also provides the first gap-dependent analysis on policy switching cost for Q-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyuwan Kim, Yang Li, Evangelia Spiliopoulou, Jie Ma, Miguel Ballesteros, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive advancements, yet information about their training data, a critical factor in their performance, remains undisclosed. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific instance was part of a target model's training data. MIAs can offer insights into LLM outputs and help detect and address concerns such as data contamination and compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, applying MIAs to LLMs presents unique challenges due to the massive scale of pre-training data and the ambiguous nature of membership. Additionally, creating appropriate benchmarks to evaluate MIA methods is not straightforward, as training and test data distributions are often unknown. In this paper, we introduce EM-MIA, a novel MIA method for LLMs that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm, leveraging the duality that the estimates of these scores can be improved by each other. Membership scores and prefix scores assess how each instance is likely to be a member and discriminative as a prefix, respectively. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiMIA dataset. To further evaluate EM-MIA, we present OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows us to control the difficulty of MIA tasks with varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. We believe that EM-MIA serves as a robust MIA method for LLMs and that OLMoMIA provides a valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating MIA approaches, thereby driving future research in this critical area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in imitating multi-modal behaviors. However, these approaches typically require large quantities of demonstration data paired with corresponding robot action labels, creating a substantial data collection burden. In this work, we propose a plan-then-control framework aimed at improving the action-data efficiency of inverse dynamics controllers by leveraging observational demonstration data. Specifically, we adopt a Deep Koopman Operator framework to model the dynamical system and utilize observation-only trajectories to learn a latent action representation. This latent representation can then be effectively mapped to real high-dimensional continuous actions using a linear action decoder, requiring minimal action-labeled data. Through experiments on simulated robot manipulation tasks and a real robot experiment with multi-modal expert demonstrations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances action-data efficiency and achieves high task success rates with limited action data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Shaofan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we have developed a variational Bayesian inference theory of elasticity, which is accomplished by using a mixed Variational Bayesian inference Finite Element Method (VBI-FEM) that can be used to solve the inverse deformation problems of continua. In the proposed variational Bayesian inference theory of continuum mechanics, the elastic strain energy is used as a prior in a Bayesian inference network, which can intelligently recover the detailed continuum deformation mappings with only given the information on the deformed and undeformed continuum body shapes without knowing the interior deformation and the precise actual boundary conditions, both traction as well as displacement boundary conditions, and the actual material constitutive relation. Moreover, we have implemented the related finite element formulation in a computational probabilistic mechanics framework. To numerically solve mixed variational problem, we developed an operator splitting or staggered algorithm that consists of the finite element (FE) step and the Bayesian learning (BL) step as an analogue of the well-known the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By solving the mixed probabilistic Galerkin variational problem, we demonstrated that the proposed method is able to inversely predict continuum deformation mappings with strong discontinuity or fracture without knowing the external load conditions. The proposed method provides a robust machine intelligent solution for the long-sought-after inverse problem solution, which has been a major challenge in structure failure forensic pattern analysis in past several decades. The proposed method may become a promising artificial intelligence-based inverse method for solving general partial differential equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangchun Zhang, Wang Zhou, Yirui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In scenarios of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with a single expert, adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) serves as a foundational approach to providing comprehensive and transferable task descriptions by restricting the reward class, e.g., to state-only rewards. However, AIRL faces practical challenges, primarily stemming from the difficulty of verifying the unobservable transition matrix - often encountered in practice - under the specific conditions necessary for effective transfer. This paper reexamines AIRL in light of the unobservable transition matrix or limited informative priors. By applying random matrix theory (RMT), we demonstrate that AIRL can disentangle rewards for effective transfer with high probability, irrespective of specific conditions. This perspective reframes inadequate transfer in certain contexts. Specifically, it is attributed to the selection problem of the reinforcement learning algorithm employed by AIRL, which is characterized by training variance. Based on this insight, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates on-policy proximal policy optimization (PPO) in the source environment with off-policy soft actor-critic (SAC) in the target environment, leading to significant improvements in reward transfer effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihailo Stojnic</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the theoretical limits of the $\ell_0$ (quasi) norm based optimization algorithms when employed for solving classical compressed sensing or sparse regression problems. Considering standard contexts with deterministic signals and statistical systems, we utilize \emph{Fully lifted random duality theory} (Fl RDT) and develop a generic analytical program for studying performance of the \emph{maximum-likelihood} (ML) decoding. The key ML performance parameter, the residual \emph{root mean square error} ($\textbf{RMSE}$), is uncovered to exhibit the so-called \emph{phase-transition} (PT) phenomenon. The associated aPT curve, which separates the regions of systems dimensions where \emph{an} $\ell_0$ based algorithm succeeds or fails in achieving small (comparable to the noise) ML optimal $\textbf{RMSE}$ is precisely determined as well. In parallel, we uncover the existence of another dPT curve which does the same separation but for practically feasible \emph{descending} $\ell_0$ ($d\ell_0$) algorithms. Concrete implementation and practical relevance of the Fl RDT typically rely on the ability to conduct a sizeable set of the underlying numerical evaluations which reveal that for the ML decoding the Fl RDT converges astonishingly fast with corrections in the estimated quantities not exceeding $\sim 0.1\%$ already on the third level of lifting. Analytical results are supplemented by a sizeable set of numerical experiments where we implement a simple variant of $d\ell_0$ and demonstrate that its practical performance very accurately matches the theoretical predictions. Completely surprisingly, a remarkably precise agreement between the simulations and the theory is observed for fairly small dimensions of the order of 100.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert A. Vandermeulen, Wai Ming Tai, Bryon Aragam</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a structured multivariate density, subject to Markov conditions implied by an undirected graph. In the worst case, without Markovian assumptions, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Our main result shows how the curse of dimensionality can be avoided or greatly alleviated under the Markov property, and applies to arbitrary graphs. While existing results along these lines focus on sparsity or manifold assumptions, we introduce a new graphical quantity called "graph resilience" and show how it controls the sample complexity. Surprisingly, although one might expect the sample complexity of this problem to scale with local graph parameters such as the degree, this turns out not to be the case. Through explicit examples, we compute uniform deviation bounds and illustrate how the curse of dimensionality in density estimation can thus be circumvented. Notable examples where the rate improves substantially include sequential, hierarchical, and spatial data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keryan Chelouche (VERI), Marie Lachaize (VERI), Marine Bernard (VERI), Louise Olgiati, Remi Cuingnet</p>
<p>Abstract: The maintenance of sewerage networks, with their millions of kilometers of pipe, heavily relies on efficient Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) inspections. Many promising approaches based on multi-label image classification have leveraged databases of historical inspection reports to automate these inspections. However, the significant presence of label noise in these databases, although known, has not been addressed. While extensive research has explored the issue of label noise in singlelabel classification (SLC), little attention has been paid to label noise in multi-label classification (MLC). To address this, we first adapted three sample selection SLC methods (Co-teaching, CoSELFIE, and DISC) that have proven robust to label noise. Our findings revealed that sample selection based solely on the small-loss trick can handle complex label noise, but it is sub-optimal. Adapting hybrid sample selection methods to noisy MLC appeared to be a more promising approach. In light of this, we developed a novel method named MHSS (Multi-label Hybrid Sample Selection) based on CoSELFIE. Through an in-depth comparative study, we demonstrated the superior performance of our approach in dealing with both synthetic complex noise and real noise, thus contributing to the ongoing efforts towards effective automation of CCTV sewer pipe inspections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Hung Nguyen (LISN), Lisheng Sun-Hosoya (LISN), Isabelle Guyon</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a large set of machine learning algorithms to convergence in order to select the best-performing algorithm for a dataset is computationally wasteful. Moreover, in a budget-limited scenario, it is crucial to carefully select an algorithm candidate and allocate a budget for training it, ensuring that the limited budget is optimally distributed to favor the most promising candidates. Casting this problem as a Markov Decision Process, we propose a novel framework in which an agent must select in the process of learning the most promising algorithm without waiting until it is fully trained. At each time step, given an observation of partial learning curves of algorithms, the agent must decide whether to allocate resources to further train the most promising algorithm (exploitation), to wake up another algorithm previously put to sleep, or to start training a new algorithm (exploration). In addition, our framework allows the agent to meta-learn from learning curves on past datasets along with dataset meta-features and algorithm hyperparameters. By incorporating meta-learning, we aim to avoid myopic decisions based solely on premature learning curves on the dataset at hand. We introduce two benchmarks of learning curves that served in international competitions at WCCI'22 and AutoML-conf'22, of which we analyze the results. Our findings show that both meta-learning and the progression of learning curves enhance the algorithm selection process, as evidenced by methods of winning teams and our DDQN baseline, compared to heuristic baselines or a random search. Interestingly, our cost-effective baseline, which selects the best-performing algorithm w.r.t. a small budget, can perform decently when learning curves do not intersect frequently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijie Zhu, Yanzhe Liang, Hanzhi Chang, Jiacheng Deng, Jiahao Lu, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in the field of 3D vision. Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new insights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Wang, Dianbo Sui, Hongliang Sun, Hao Ding, Bolin Zhang, Zhiying Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) services exhibit impressive capability on unlearned tasks leveraging only a few examples by in-context learning (ICL). However, the success of ICL varies depending on the task and context, leading to heterogeneous service quality. Directly estimating the performance of LLM services at each invocation can be laborious, especially requiring abundant labeled data or internal information within the LLM. This paper introduces a novel method to estimate the performance of LLM services across different tasks and contexts, which can be "plug-and-play" utilizing only a few unlabeled samples like ICL. Our findings suggest that the negative log-likelihood and perplexity derived from LLM service invocation can function as effective and significant features. Based on these features, we utilize four distinct meta-models to estimate the performance of LLM services. Our proposed method is compared against unlabeled estimation baselines across multiple LLM services and tasks. And it is experimentally applied to two scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in the selection and further optimization of LLM services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miroslav Cibula, Matthias Kerzel, Igor Farka\v{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal learning allows humans to predict the effect of their actions on the known environment and use this knowledge to plan the execution of more complex actions. Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can be used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of knowledge is also crucial in the design of intelligent robotic systems with common sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward and inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved in two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step, we investigate feature attribution methods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level causal effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related to both the arm joints and the environment features. This type of analysis provides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state representations, as well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the explainability of causal effects at higher levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danush Kumar Venkatesh, Dominik Rivoir, Micha Pfeiffer, Fiona Kolbinger, Stefanie Speidel</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer-assisted surgery, automatically recognizing anatomical organs is crucial for understanding the surgical scene and providing intraoperative assistance. While machine learning models can identify such structures, their deployment is hindered by the need for labeled, diverse surgical datasets with anatomical annotations. Labeling multiple classes (i.e., organs) in a surgical scene is time-intensive, requiring medical experts. Although synthetically generated images can enhance segmentation performance, maintaining both organ structure and texture during generation is challenging. We introduce a multi-stage approach using diffusion models to generate multi-class surgical datasets with annotations. Our framework improves anatomy awareness by training organ specific models with an inpainting objective guided by binary segmentation masks. The organs are generated with an inference pipeline using pre-trained ControlNet to maintain the organ structure. The synthetic multi-class datasets are constructed through an image composition step, ensuring structural and textural consistency. This versatile approach allows the generation of multi-class datasets from real binary datasets and simulated surgical masks. We thoroughly evaluate the generated datasets on image quality and downstream segmentation, achieving a $15\%$ improvement in segmentation scores when combined with real images.

<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrated state-of-the-art results on various reasoning tasks when applying the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique. CoT prompting guides the model into breaking tasks into a few intermediate steps and provides step-by-step demonstrations. However, solving complex reasoning tasks remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting strategy inspired by Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). DBT, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, aims to help individuals cope with stress by developing a system of reasoning. We applied DBT's basic concepts of shaping dialog to construct prompts and conducted experiments on different datasets and LLMs with various numbers of parameters. Our results show that prompts crafted with DBT techniques significantly improve results on smaller models, achieving a 7% increase in accuracy on the StrategyQA, 4.8% on Aqua dataset using 8b parameters model, and a 16.2% increase on the StrategyQA, 5.3% on GSM8K dataset with 14b parameters model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (ONMF) has become a standard approach for clustering. As far as we know, most works on ONMF rely on the Frobenius norm to assess the quality of the approximation. This paper presents a new model and algorithm for ONMF that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As opposed to the Frobenius norm which assumes Gaussian noise, the KL divergence is the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson-distributed data, which can model better vectors of word counts in document data sets and photo counting processes in imaging. We have developed an algorithm based on alternating optimization, KL-ONMF, and show that it performs favorably with the Frobenius-norm based ONMF for document classification and hyperspectral image unmixing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\"urkan Soykan, G\"ozde G\"ul \c{S}ahin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual language models often perform unevenly across different languages due to limited generalization capabilities for some languages. This issue is significant because of the growing interest in making universal language models that work well for all languages. Instruction tuning with multilingual instruction-response pairs has been used to improve model performance across various languages. However, this approach is challenged by high computational costs, a lack of quality tuning data for all languages, and the "curse of multilinguality" -- the performance drop per language after adding many languages. Recent studies have found that working with datasets with few languages and a smaller number of instances can be beneficial. Yet, there exists no systematic investigation into how choosing different languages affects multilingual instruction tuning. Our study proposes a method to select languages for instruction tuning in a linguistically informed way, aiming to boost model performance across languages and tasks. We use a simple algorithm to choose diverse languages and test their effectiveness on various benchmarks and open-ended questions. Our results show that this careful selection generally leads to better outcomes than choosing languages at random. We suggest a new and simple way of enhancing multilingual models by selecting diverse languages based on linguistic features that could help develop better multilingual systems and guide dataset creation efforts. All resources, including the code for language selection and multilingual instruction tuning, are made available in our official repository at https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/ling-informed-mit enabling reproducibility and further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soobin Um, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

The proposed approach, sparse Group Factor Analysis (GFA) with regularised horseshoe priors, was implemented with probabilistic programming and can uncover associations (or latent factors) among multiple data modalities differentially expressed in sample subgroups. Synthetic data experiments showed the robustness of our sparse GFA by correctly inferring latent factors and model parameters. When applied to the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI) dataset, which comprises patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with genetically defined subgroups, the sparse GFA identified latent disease factors differentially expressed across the subgroups, distinguishing between "subgroup-specific" latent factors within homogeneous groups and "subgroup common" latent factors shared across subgroups. The latent disease factors captured associations between brain structure and non-imaging variables (i.e., questionnaires assessing behaviour and disease severity) across the different genetic subgroups, offering insights into disease profiles. Importantly, two latent factors were more pronounced in the two more homogeneous FTD patient subgroups (progranulin (GRN) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutation), showcasing the method's ability to reveal subgroup-specific characteristics. These findings underscore the potential of sparse GFA for integrating multiple data modalities and identifying interpretable latent disease factors that can improve the characterization and stratification of patients with neurological and mental health disorders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Bharti, Daolang Huang, Samuel Kaski, Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is the preferred framework for estimating parameters of intractable models in science and engineering. A significant challenge in this context is the large computational cost of simulating data from complex models, and the fact that this cost often depends on parameter values. We therefore propose \textit{cost-aware SBI methods} which can significantly reduce the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric G. Stratman, Justin J. Boutilier, Laura A. Albert</p>
<p>Abstract: Many organizations depend on human decision-makers to make subjective decisions, especially in settings where information is scarce. Although workers are often viewed as interchangeable, the specific individual assigned to a task can significantly impact outcomes due to their unique decision-making processes and risk tolerance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes machine learning to predict worker behavior and employs integer optimization to strategically assign workers to tasks. Unlike traditional methods that treat machine learning predictions as static inputs for optimization, in our approach, the optimal predictive model used to represent a worker's behavior is determined by how that worker is allocated within the optimization process. We present a decision-aware optimization framework that integrates predictive model selection with worker allocation. Collaborating with an auto-insurance provider and using real-world data, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method by applying three different techniques to predict worker behavior. Our findings show the proposed decision-aware framework outperforms traditional methods and offers context-sensitive and data-responsive strategies for workforce management.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07951">Disease Entity Recognition and Normalization is Improved with Large Language Model Derived Synthetic Normalized Mentions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuleen Sasse, Shinjitha Vadlakonda, Richard E. Kennedy, John D. Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning. However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs. For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases. Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.
  Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13B Chat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group. We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation. We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.
  Results: Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data. A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.
  Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions. Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance. The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER. We make our software and dataset publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yang, Yuntian Gu, Ziruo Wang, Yitao Liang, Tongyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitNet, the first benchmark and test dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms in the form of quantum circuit codes. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally different and significantly more complicated due to highly flexible design space and intricate manipulation of qubits. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design task for Large Language Models. 2. Implementation for a wide range of quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, with easy extension to more quantum algorithms. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through primitive fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning, and LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns. QCircuitNet provides a comprehensive benchmark for AI-driven quantum algorithm design, offering advantages in model evaluation and improvement, while also revealing some limitations of LLMs in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baraah A. M. Sidahmed, Tatjana Chavdarova</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) presents unique challenges as agents learn strategies through experiences. Gradient-based methods are often sensitive to hyperparameter selection and initial random seed variations. Concurrently, significant advances have been made in solving Variational Inequalities (VIs) which include equilibrium-finding problems particularly in addressing the non-converging rotational dynamics that impede convergence of traditional gradient based optimization methods. This paper explores the potential of leveraging VI-based techniques to improve MARL training. Specifically, we study the performance of VI method namely, Nested-Lookahead VI (nLA-VI) and Extragradient (EG) in enhancing the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. We present a VI reformulation of the actor-critic algorithm for both single- and multi-agent settings. We introduce three algorithms that use nLA-VI, EG, and a combination of both, named LA-MADDPG, EG-MADDPG, and LA-EG-MADDPG, respectively. Our empirical results demonstrate that these VI-based approaches yield significant performance improvements in benchmark environments, such as the zero-sum games: rock-paper-scissors and matching pennies, where equilibrium strategies can be quantitatively assessed, and the Multi-Agent Particle Environment: Predator prey benchmark, where VI-based methods also yield balanced participation of agents from the same team.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Huang, Tao Yang, Ivan Habernal, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models for NLP tasks are prone to variants of privacy attacks. To prevent privacy leakage, researchers have investigated word-level perturbations, relying on the formal guarantees of differential privacy (DP) in the embedding space. However, many existing approaches either achieve unsatisfactory performance in the high privacy regime when using the Laplacian or Gaussian mechanism, or resort to weaker relaxations of DP that are inferior to the canonical DP in terms of privacy strength. This raises the question of whether a new method for private word embedding can be designed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel private embedding method called the high dimensional truncated Laplacian mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a non-trivial extension of the truncated Laplacian mechanism, which was previously only investigated in one-dimensional space cases. Theoretically, we show that our method has a lower variance compared to the previous private word embedding methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive experiments on private embedding and downstream tasks using three datasets. Remarkably, even in the high privacy regime, our approach only incurs a slight decrease in utility compared to the non-private scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiling Chen, Safwan Hossain, Evi Micha, Ariel Procaccia</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new variant of the strategic classification problem: a principal reveals a classifier, and $n$ agents report their (possibly manipulated) features to be classified. Motivated by real-world applications, our model crucially allows the manipulation of one agent to affect another; that is, it explicitly captures inter-agent externalities. The principal-agent interactions are formally modeled as a Stackelberg game, with the resulting agent manipulation dynamics captured as a simultaneous game. We show that under certain assumptions, the pure Nash Equilibrium of this agent manipulation game is unique and can be efficiently computed. Leveraging this result, PAC learning guarantees are established for the learner: informally, we show that it is possible to learn classifiers that minimize loss on the distribution, even when a random number of agents are manipulating their way to a pure Nash Equilibrium. We also comment on the optimization of such classifiers through gradient-based approaches. This work sets the theoretical foundations for a more realistic analysis of classifiers that are robust against multiple strategic actors interacting in a common environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the paradigm of large convolutional kernels in designing modern Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which offers systematical architecture design principles specifically crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive scalability and performance on various modalities such as time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias, moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inderjeet Nair, Jiaye Tan, Xiaotian Su, Anne Gere, Xu Wang, Lu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing feedback is widely recognized as crucial for refining students' writing skills. Recent advances in language models (LMs) have made it possible to automatically generate feedback that is actionable and well-aligned with human-specified attributes. However, it remains unclear whether the feedback generated by these models is truly effective in enhancing the quality of student revisions. Moreover, prompting LMs with a precise set of instructions to generate feedback is nontrivial due to the lack of consensus regarding the specific attributes that can lead to improved revising performance. To address these challenges, we propose PROF that PROduces Feedback via learning from LM simulated student revisions. PROF aims to iteratively optimize the feedback generator by directly maximizing the effectiveness of students' overall revising performance as simulated by LMs. Focusing on an economic essay assignment, we empirically test the efficacy of PROF and observe that our approach not only surpasses a variety of baseline methods in effectiveness of improving students' writing but also demonstrates enhanced pedagogical values, even though it was not explicitly trained for this aspect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojian Yuan, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent equivariant models have shown significant progress in not just chemical property prediction, but as surrogates for dynamical simulations of molecules and materials. Many of the top performing models in this category are built within the framework of tensor products, which preserves equivariance by restricting interactions and transformations to those that are allowed by symmetry selection rules. Despite being a core part of the modeling process, there has not yet been much attention into understanding what information persists in these equivariant representations, and their general behavior outside of benchmark metrics. In this work, we report on a set of experiments using a simple equivariant graph convolution model on the QM9 dataset, focusing on correlating quantitative performance with the resulting molecular graph embeddings. Our key finding is that, for a scalar prediction task, many of the irreducible representations are simply ignored during training -- specifically those pertaining to vector ($l=1$) and tensor quantities ($l=2$) -- an issue that does not necessarily make itself evident in the test metric. We empirically show that removing some unused orders of spherical harmonics improves model performance, correlating with improved latent space structure. We provide a number of recommendations for future experiments to try and improve efficiency and utilization of equivariant features based on these observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathis Pink, Vy A. Vo, Qinyuan Wu, Jianing Mu, Javier S. Turek, Uri Hasson, Kenneth A. Norman, Sebastian Michelmann, Alexander Huth, Mariya Toneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM benchmarks focus on evaluating models' memory of facts and semantic relations, primarily assessing semantic aspects of long-term memory. However, in humans, long-term memory also includes episodic memory, which links memories to their contexts, such as the time and place they occurred. The ability to contextualize memories is crucial for many cognitive tasks and everyday functions. This form of memory has not been evaluated in LLMs with existing benchmarks. To address the gap in evaluating memory in LLMs, we introduce Sequence Order Recall Tasks (SORT), which we adapt from tasks used to study episodic memory in cognitive psychology. SORT requires LLMs to recall the correct order of text segments, and provides a general framework that is both easily extendable and does not require any additional annotations. We present an initial evaluation dataset, Book-SORT, comprising 36k pairs of segments extracted from 9 books recently added to the public domain. Based on a human experiment with 155 participants, we show that humans can recall sequence order based on long-term memory of a book. We find that models can perform the task with high accuracy when relevant text is given in-context during the SORT evaluation. However, when presented with the book text only during training, LLMs' performance on SORT falls short. By allowing to evaluate more aspects of memory, we believe that SORT will aid in the emerging development of memory-augmented models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. In this work, we show that existing models can be naturally extended to autoregressive video diffusion models without changing the architectures. Our key idea is to assign the latent frames with progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level, which allows for fine-grained condition among the latents and large overlaps between the attention windows. Such progressive video denoising allows our models to autoregressively generate video frames without quality degradation or abrupt scene changes. We present state-of-the-art results on long video generation at 1 minute (1440 frames at 24 FPS). Videos from this paper are available at https://desaixie.github.io/pa-vdm/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the dominant approach for visual generation. They are trained by denoising a Markovian process that gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the models ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model with the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, enabling more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works. Our anonymous website: https://sites.google.com/view/evaltasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingni Wang, Tiantian Geng, Zhiyuan Wang, Teng Wang, Bo Fu, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lu, Yifan Zhang, Qiuhong Shen, Xinchao Wang, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), known for its groundbreaking performance and efficiency, has become a dominant 3D representation and brought progress to many 3D vision tasks. However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures. We hope the revelation of this novel attack surface can spark attention to this crucial yet overlooked vulnerability of 3DGS systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javan Tahir, Surya Ganguli, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale pre-trained neural networks, methods to adapt such "foundation" models to data-limited downstream tasks have become a necessity. Fine-tuning, preference optimization, and transfer learning have all been successfully employed for these purposes when the target task closely resembles the source task, but a precise theoretical understanding of "task similarity" is still lacking. While conventional wisdom suggests that simple measures of similarity between source and target distributions, such as $\phi$-divergences or integral probability metrics, can directly predict the success of transfer, we prove the surprising fact that, in general, this is not the case. We adopt, instead, a feature-centric viewpoint on transfer learning and establish a number of theoretical results that demonstrate that when the target task is well represented by the feature space of the pre-trained model, transfer learning outperforms training from scratch. We study deep linear networks as a minimal model of transfer learning in which we can analytically characterize the transferability phase diagram as a function of the target dataset size and the feature space overlap. For this model, we establish rigorously that when the feature space overlap between the source and target tasks is sufficiently strong, both linear transfer and fine-tuning improve performance, especially in the low data limit. These results build on an emerging understanding of feature learning dynamics in deep linear networks, and we demonstrate numerically that the rigorous results we derive for the linear case also apply to nonlinear networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Zhu, Honghui Yang, Yating Wang, Jiange Yang, Limin Wang, Tong He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengcao Cao, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

<p>Abstract: We study the adversarial bandit problem against arbitrary strategies, in which $S$ is the parameter for the hardness of the problem and this parameter is not given to the agent. To handle this problem, we adopt the master-base framework using the online mirror descent method (OMD). We first provide a master-base algorithm with simple OMD, achieving $\tilde{O}(S^{1/2}K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, in which $T^{2/3}$ comes from the variance of loss estimators. To mitigate the impact of the variance, we propose using adaptive learning rates for OMD and achieve $\tilde{O}(\min\{\mathbb{E}[\sqrt{SKT\rho_T(h^\dagger)}],S\sqrt{KT}\})$, where $\rho_T(h^\dagger)$ is a variance term for loss estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhartha Banerjee, Sean R. Sinclair, Milind Tambe, Lily Xu, Christina Lee Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most real-world deployments of bandit algorithms exist somewhere in between the offline and online set-up, where some historical data is available upfront and additional data is collected dynamically online. How best to incorporate historical data to "warm start" bandit algorithms is an open question: naively initializing reward estimates using all historical samples can suffer from spurious data and imbalanced data coverage, leading to computation and storage issues-particularly for continuous action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Artificial-Replay, a meta-algorithm for incorporating historical data into any arbitrary base bandit algorithm. We show that Artificial-Replay uses only a fraction of the historical data compared to a full warm-start approach, while still achieving identical regret for base algorithms that satisfy independence of irrelevant data (IIData), a novel and broadly applicable property that we introduce. We complement these theoretical results with experiments on (i) K-armed bandits and (ii) continuous combinatorial bandits, on which we model green security domains using real poaching data. Our results show the practical benefits of Artificial-Replayin reducing computation and space complexity, including for base algorithms that do not satisfy IIData.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04088">A Penalty-Based Method for Communication-Efficient Decentralized Bilevel Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Parvin Nazari, Ahmad Mousavi, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, George Michailidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilevel programming has recently received attention in the literature due to its wide range of applications, including reinforcement learning and hyper-parameter optimization. However, it is widely assumed that the underlying bilevel optimization problem is solved either by a single machine or, in the case of multiple machines connected in a star-shaped network, i.e., in a federated learning setting. The latter approach suffers from a high communication cost on the central node (e.g., parameter server). Hence, there is an interest in developing methods that solve bilevel optimization problems in a communication-efficient, decentralized manner. To that end, this paper introduces a penalty function-based decentralized algorithm with theoretical guarantees for this class of optimization problems. Specifically, a distributed alternating gradient-type algorithm for solving consensus bilevel programming over a decentralized network is developed. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is the estimation of the hyper-gradient of the penalty function through decentralized computation of matrix-vector products and a few vector communications. The estimation is integrated into an alternating algorithm for solving the penalized reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. Under appropriate step sizes and penalty parameters, our theoretical framework ensures non-asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution of the original problem under various convexity conditions. Our theoretical result highlights improvements in the iteration complexity of decentralized bilevel optimization, all while making efficient use of vector communication. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranga Shaarad Ayyagari, Ambedkar Dukkipati</p>
<p>Abstract: Most reinforcement learning algorithms treat the context under which they operate as a stationary, isolated, and undisturbed environment. However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. First, we formalize this notion and derive conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. Our analysis addresses the non-stationarity present in the MDP as a result of non-Markovian events, necessitating the formulation of policies that are contingent upon both the current state and a history of prior events. Additionally, we derive insights regarding the sample complexity of the algorithm and incorporate factors that define the exogenous temporal process into the established bounds. Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate our findings within a traditional control environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Jesson, Chris Lu, Gunshi Gupta, Nicolas Beltran-Velez, Angelos Filos, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a step toward approximate Bayesian inference in on-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning. It is implemented through three changes to the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm: (1) applying a ReLU function to advantage estimates, (2) spectral normalization of actor-critic weights, and (3) incorporating \emph{dropout as a Bayesian approximation}. We prove under standard assumptions that restricting policy updates to positive advantages optimizes for value by maximizing a lower bound on the value function plus an additive term. We show that the additive term is bounded proportional to the Lipschitz constant of the value function, which offers theoretical grounding for spectral normalization of critic weights. Finally, our application of dropout corresponds to approximate Bayesian inference over both the actor and critic parameters, which enables \textit{adaptive state-aware} exploration around the modes of the actor via Thompson sampling. We demonstrate significant improvements for median and interquartile mean metrics over A3C, PPO, SAC, and TD3 on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark and improvement over PPO in the challenging ProcGen generalization benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunder Ali Khowaja, Kapal Dev, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Marius George Linguraru</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Sapkota, Binod Bhattarai</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of multiple neural architectures like CNNs, Transformers, and MLP-Mixers motivated us to look for similarities and differences between them. We found that these architectures can be interpreted through the lens of a general concept of dimension mixing. Research on coupling flows and the butterfly transform shows that partial and hierarchical signal mixing schemes are sufficient for efficient and expressive function approximation. In this work, we study group-wise sparse, non-linear, multi-layered and learnable mixing schemes of inputs and find that they are complementary to many standard neural architectures. Following our observations and drawing inspiration from the Fast Fourier Transform, we generalize Butterfly Structure to use non-linear mixer function allowing for MLP as mixing function called Butterfly MLP. We were also able to sparsely mix along sequence dimension for Transformer-based architectures called Butterfly Attention. Experiments on CIFAR and LRA datasets demonstrate that the proposed Non-Linear Butterfly Mixers are efficient and scale well when the host architectures are used as mixing function. Additionally, we propose Patch-Only MLP-Mixer for processing spatial 2D signals demonstrating a different dimension mixing strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Andersdotter, Daniel Persson, Fredrik Ohlsson</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a manifestly geometric framework for equivariant manifold neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and use it to analyse their modelling capabilities for symmetric data. First, we consider the action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ and establish the equivalence between equivariance of vector fields, symmetries of the corresponding Cauchy problems, and equivariance of the associated NODEs. We also propose a novel formulation, based on Lie theory for symmetries of differential equations, of the equivariant manifold NODEs in terms of the differential invariants of the action of $G$ on $M$, which provides an efficient parameterisation of the space of equivariant vector fields in a way that is agnostic to both the manifold $M$ and the symmetry group $G$. Second, we construct augmented manifold NODEs, through embeddings into flows on the tangent bundle $TM$, and show that they are universal approximators of diffeomorphisms on any connected $M$. Furthermore, we show that universality persists in the equivariant case and that the augmented equivariant manifold NODEs can be incorporated into the geometric framework using higher-order differential invariants. Finally, we consider the induced action of $G$ on different fields on $M$ and show how it can be used to generalise previous work, on, e.g., continuous normalizing flows, to equivariant models in any geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianying Ren, Dongsheng Luo, Dongjin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, various contrastive learning techniques have been developed to categorize time series data and exhibit promising performance. A general paradigm is to utilize appropriate augmentations and construct feasible positive samples such that the encoder can yield robust and discriminative representations by mapping similar data points closer together in the feature space while pushing dissimilar data points farther apart. Despite its efficacy, the fine-grained relative similarity (e.g., rank) information of positive samples is largely ignored, especially when labeled samples are limited. To this end, we present Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning (RankSCL) to perform time series classification. Different from conventional contrastive learning frameworks, RankSCL augments raw data in a targeted way in the embedding space and adopts certain filtering rules to select more informative positive and negative pairs of samples. Moreover, a novel rank loss is developed to assign different weights for different levels of positive samples, enable the encoder to extract the fine-grained information of the same class, and produce a clear boundary among different classes. Thoroughly empirical studies on 128 UCR datasets and 30 UEA datasets demonstrate that the proposed RankSCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Morita</p>
<p>Abstract: This study reports an unintuitive finding that positional encoding enhances learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Positional encoding is a high-dimensional representation of time indices on input data. Most famously, positional encoding complements the capabilities of Transformer neural networks, which lack an inherent mechanism for representing the data order. By contrast, RNNs can encode the temporal information of data points on their own, rendering their use of positional encoding seemingly redundant/unnecessary. Nonetheless, investigations through synthetic benchmarks reveal an advantage of coupling positional encoding and RNNs, especially for handling a large vocabulary that yields low-frequency tokens. Further scrutinization unveils that these low-frequency tokens destabilizes the gradients of vanilla RNNs, and the positional encoding resolves this instability. These results shed a new light on the utility of positional encoding beyond its canonical role as a timekeeper for Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time series analysis. Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuxinlin Cheng, Chenhui Deng, Ali Aghdaei, Zhiru Zhang, Zhuo Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern graph neural networks (GNNs) can be sensitive to changes in the input graph structure and node features, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. In this work, we introduce a spectral framework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of GNNs. This framework assesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings of GNNs between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two distant ones on the output manifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor GNN stability. We propose a distance-preserving graph dimension reduction (GDR) approach that utilizes spectral graph embedding and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to create low-dimensional input/output graph-based manifolds for meaningful stability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectively assesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or feature perturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability of GNNs, extending to applications within recommendation systems. Furthermore, we illustrate its utility in downstream tasks, notably in enhancing GNN stability and facilitating adversarial targeted attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze recurrent neural networks with diagonal hidden-to-hidden weight matrices, trained with gradient descent in the supervised learning setting, and prove that gradient descent can achieve optimality \emph{without} massive overparameterization. Our in-depth nonasymptotic analysis (i) provides improved bounds on the network size $m$ in terms of the sequence length $T$, sample size $n$ and ambient dimension $d$, and (ii) identifies the significant impact of long-term dependencies in the dynamical system on the convergence and network width bounds characterized by a cutoff point that depends on the Lipschitz continuity of the activation function. Remarkably, this analysis reveals that an appropriately-initialized recurrent neural network trained with $n$ samples can achieve optimality with a network size $m$ that scales only logarithmically with $n$. This sharply contrasts with the prior works that require high-order polynomial dependency of $m$ on $n$ to establish strong regularity conditions. Our results are based on an explicit characterization of the class of dynamical systems that can be approximated and learned by recurrent neural networks via norm-constrained transportation mappings, and establishing local smoothness properties of the hidden state with respect to the learnable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Alkin, Andreas F\"urst, Simon Schmid, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjeev Raja, Ishan Amin, Fabian Pedregosa, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Creston Brooks, Robert Calef, Charlie Cowen-Breen, Anna Sappington</p>
<p>Abstract: Beam search with masked language models (MLMs) is challenging in part because joint probability distributions over sequences are not readily available, unlike for autoregressive models. However, estimating such distributions has important domain-specific applications such as ancient text restoration and protein engineering. Here we present probabilistically-sound methods for beam search with MLMs. First, we clarify the conditions under which it is theoretically sound to perform text infilling with MLMs using standard beam search. When these conditions fail, we provide a probabilistically-sound inference time modification with no additional computational complexity and demonstrate that it is superior to the aforementioned beam search in the expected conditions. We then present empirical results comparing several infilling approaches with MLMs across several domains. Notably, our method probes the inductive biases of MLMs and explores the surprising contextual sensitivity of mask tokens for text infilling.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to map large instances, such as sequences and images, to outputs. Since training one large neural network end to end with backpropagation is plagued by vanishing gradients and degradation, we develop a novel neural network architecture called Extraction propagation, which works by training, in parallel, many small neural networks which interact with one another. We note that the performance of Extraction propagation is only conjectured as we have yet to implement it. We do, however, back the algorithm with some theory. A previous version of this paper was entitled "Fusion encoder networks" and detailed a slightly different architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Balauca, Mark Niklas M\"uller, Yuhao Mao, Maximilian Baader, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Training neural networks with high certified accuracy against adversarial examples remains an open challenge despite significant efforts. While certification methods can effectively leverage tight convex relaxations for bound computation, in training, these methods, perhaps surprisingly, can perform worse than looser relaxations. Prior work hypothesized that this phenomenon is caused by the discontinuity, non-smoothness, and perturbation sensitivity of the loss surface induced by tighter relaxations. In this work, we theoretically show that Gaussian Loss Smoothing (GLS) can alleviate these issues. We confirm this empirically by instantiating GLS with two variants: a zeroth-order optimization algorithm, called PGPE, which allows training with non-differentiable relaxations, and a first-order optimization algorithm, called RGS, which requires gradients of the relaxation but is much more efficient than PGPE. Extensive experiments show that when combined with tight relaxations, these methods surpass state-of-the-art methods when training on the same network architecture for many settings. Our results clearly demonstrate the promise of Gaussian Loss Smoothing for training certifiably robust neural networks and pave a path towards leveraging tighter relaxations for certified training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models are invaluable in many fields of science because of their ability to capture high-dimensional and complicated distributions, such as photo-realistic images, protein structures, and connectomes. How do we evaluate the samples these models generate? This work aims to provide an accessible entry point to understanding popular sample-based statistical distances, requiring only foundational knowledge in mathematics and statistics. We focus on four commonly used notions of statistical distances representing different methodologies: Using low-dimensional projections (Sliced-Wasserstein; SW), obtaining a distance using classifiers (Classifier Two-Sample Tests; C2ST), using embeddings through kernels (Maximum Mean Discrepancy; MMD), or neural networks (Fr\'echet Inception Distance; FID). We highlight the intuition behind each distance and explain their merits, scalability, complexity, and pitfalls. To demonstrate how these distances are used in practice, we evaluate generative models from different scientific domains, namely a model of decision-making and a model generating medical images. We showcase that distinct distances can give different results on similar data. Through this guide, we aim to help researchers to use, interpret, and evaluate statistical distances for generative models in science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Yu, Chenjia Bai, Haoran He, Changhong Wang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential decision-making is desired to align with human intents and exhibit versatility across various tasks. Previous methods formulate it as a conditional generation process, utilizing return-conditioned diffusion models to directly model trajectory distributions. Nevertheless, the return-conditioned paradigm relies on pre-defined reward functions, facing challenges when applied in multi-task settings characterized by varying reward functions (versatility) and showing limited controllability concerning human preferences (alignment). In this work, we adopt multi-task preferences as a unified condition for both single- and multi-task decision-making, and propose preference representations aligned with preference labels. The learned representations are used to guide the conditional generation process of diffusion models, and we introduce an auxiliary objective to maximize the mutual information between representations and corresponding generated trajectories, improving alignment between trajectories and preferences. Extensive experiments in D4RL and Meta-World demonstrate that our method presents favorable performance in single- and multi-task scenarios, and exhibits superior alignment with preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toshimitsu Uesaka, Taiji Suzuki, Yuhta Takida, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Naoki Murata, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: In typical multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, encoders produce one point in the latent representation space for each input. However, one-point representation has difficulty in capturing the relationship and the similarity structure of a huge amount of instances in the real world. For richer classes of the similarity, we propose the use of weighted point clouds, namely, sets of pairs of weight and vector, as representations of instances. In this work, we theoretically show the benefit of our proposed method through a new understanding of the contrastive loss of CLIP, which we call symmetric InfoNCE. We clarify that the optimal similarity that minimizes symmetric InfoNCE is the pointwise mutual information, and show an upper bound of excess risk on downstream classification tasks of representations that achieve the optimal similarity. In addition, we show that our proposed similarity based on weighted point clouds consistently achieves the optimal similarity. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we demonstrate pretraining of text-image representation models and classification tasks on common benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinsong Chen, Samson S. Yu, Zhong Li, Chee Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the inconsistency in Bayesian deep learning has garnered increasing attention. Tempered or generalized posterior distributions often offer a direct and effective solution to this issue. However, understanding the underlying causes and evaluating the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain active areas of research. In this study, we introduce a unified theoretical framework to attribute Bayesian inconsistency to model misspecification and inadequate priors. We interpret the generalization of the posterior with a temperature factor as a correction for misspecified models through adjustments to the joint probability model, and the recalibration of priors by redistributing probability mass on models within the hypothesis space using data samples. Additionally, we highlight a distinctive feature of Laplace approximation, which ensures that the generalized normalizing constant can be treated as invariant, unlike the typical scenario in general Bayesian learning where this constant varies with model parameters post-generalization. Building on this insight, we propose the generalized Laplace approximation, which involves a simple adjustment to the computation of the Hessian matrix of the regularized loss function. This method offers a flexible and scalable framework for obtaining high-quality posterior distributions. We assess the performance and properties of the generalized Laplace approximation on state-of-the-art neural networks and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Zhenglin Cheng, Xiaoying Tang, Zhaopeng Tu, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results. However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Halbheer, Dominik J. M\"uhlematter, Alexander Becker, Dominik Narnhofer, Helge Aasen, Konrad Schindler, Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous crucial tasks in real-world decision-making rely on machine learning algorithms with calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Scarvelis, Justin Solomon</p>
<p>Abstract: Penalizing the nuclear norm of a function's Jacobian encourages it to locally behave like a low-rank linear map. Such functions vary locally along only a handful of directions, making the Jacobian nuclear norm a natural regularizer for machine learning problems. However, this regularizer is intractable for high-dimensional problems, as it requires computing a large Jacobian matrix and taking its singular value decomposition. We show how to efficiently penalize the Jacobian nuclear norm using techniques tailor-made for deep learning. We prove that for functions parametrized as compositions $f = g \circ h$, one may equivalently penalize the average squared Frobenius norm of $Jg$ and $Jh$. We then propose a denoising-style approximation that avoids the Jacobian computations altogether. Our method is simple, efficient, and accurate, enabling Jacobian nuclear norm regularization to scale to high-dimensional deep learning problems. We complement our theory with an empirical study of our regularizer's performance and investigate applications to denoising and representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathieu Chevalley, Patrick Schwab, Arash Mehrjou</p>
<p>Abstract: Targeted and uniform interventions to a system are crucial for unveiling causal relationships. While several methods have been developed to leverage interventional data for causal structure learning, their practical application in real-world scenarios often remains challenging. Recent benchmark studies have highlighted these difficulties, even when large numbers of single-variable intervention samples are available. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that such datasets contain a wealth of causal information that can be effectively extracted under realistic assumptions about the data distribution. More specifically, we introduce the notion of interventional faithfulness, which relies on comparisons between the marginal distributions of each variable across observational and interventional settings, and we introduce a score on causal orders. Under this assumption, we are able to prove strong theoretical guarantees on the optimum of our score that also hold for large-scale settings. To empirically verify our theory, we introduce Intersort, an algorithm designed to infer the causal order from datasets containing large numbers of single-variable interventions by approximately optimizing our score. Intersort outperforms baselines (GIES, DCDI, PC and EASE) on almost all simulated data settings replicating common benchmarks in the field. Our proposed novel approach to modeling interventional datasets thus offers a promising avenue for advancing causal inference, highlighting significant potential for further enhancements under realistic assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenao Zhang, Donghan Yu, Hiteshi Sharma, Han Zhong, Zhihan Liu, Ziyi Yang, Shuohang Wang, Hany Hassan, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named \textit{Self-Exploring Language Models} (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to \textit{Direct Preference Optimization} (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that when fine-tuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings.

<p>Abstract: Invariant Contrastive Learning (ICL) methods have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the absence of latent space representation for distortion (augmentation)-related information in the latent space makes ICL sub-optimal regarding training efficiency and robustness in downstream tasks. Recent studies suggest that introducing equivariance into Contrastive Learning (CL) can improve overall performance. In this paper, we revisit the roles of augmentation strategies and equivariance in improving CL's efficacy. We propose CLeVER (Contrastive Learning Via Equivariant Representation), a novel equivariant contrastive learning framework compatible with augmentation strategies of arbitrary complexity for various mainstream CL backbone models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLeVER effectively extracts and incorporates equivariant information from practical natural images, thereby improving the training efficiency and robustness of baseline models in downstream tasks and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Moreover, we find that leveraging equivariant information extracted by CLeVER simultaneously enhances rotational invariance and sensitivity across experimental tasks, and helps stabilize the framework when handling complex augmentations, particularly for models with small-scale backbones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve as universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.</p>

In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training certifiably robust neural networks is an important but challenging task. While many algorithms for (deterministic) certified training have been proposed, they are often evaluated on different training schedules, certification methods, and systematically under-tuned hyperparameters, making it difficult to compare their performance. To address this challenge, we introduce CTBENCH, a unified library and a high-quality benchmark for certified training that evaluates all algorithms under fair settings and systematically tuned hyperparameters. We show that (1) almost all algorithms in CTBENCH surpass the corresponding reported performance in literature in the magnitude of algorithmic improvements, thus establishing new state-of-the-art, and (2) the claimed advantage of recent algorithms drops significantly when we enhance the outdated baselines with a fair training schedule, a fair certification method and well-tuned hyperparameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Schug, Seijin Kobayashi, Yassir Akram, Jo\~ao Sacramento, Razvan Pascanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is predictive of the subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions revealing that latent codes acquired during training are reused to solve unseen problem instances. To further examine the hypothesis that the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention supports compositional generalization, we ablate whether making the hypernetwork generated linear value network nonlinear strengthens compositionality. We find that this modification improves compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven Progressive Matrices human intelligence test which gives us precise control over the problem compositions encountered during training and evaluation. We demonstrate on this task how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization in transformers and gives rise to a functionally structured latent space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiye Zhou, Shucheng Wang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training because they must limit the update frequency to maintain optimizer state consistency, hindering their ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model while reducing communication overhead by 54\% on the LLaMA 1.3B model. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model. This demonstrates enhanced generalization and reasoning capabilities of SwitchLoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yair Davidson, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough.
  In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent
  that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcello Massimo Negri, Jonathan Aellen, Volker Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are powerful and efficient models for density estimation. When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for star-like manifolds and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. This aspect is particularly relevant for variational inference settings, where no samples are available and only some unnormalized target is known. Among many, we showcase the relevance of modeling densities on star-like manifolds in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach for penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider probabilistic mixing models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Lin, Guojiang Zhao, Odin Zhang, Yufei Huang, Lirong Wu, Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Cheng Tan, Zhifeng Gao, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate potential drugs that can bind to a target protein and is greatly expedited by the aid of AI techniques in generative models. However, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, difficult reproducibility, and task singularity. Firstly, the absence of standardization can lead to unfair comparisons and inconclusive insights. To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative heterogeneous graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements various cutting-edge methods. Secondly, a single task on \textit{de novo} molecule generation can hardly reflect their capabilities. To broaden the scope, we have adapted these models to a range of tasks essential in drug design, which are considered sub-tasks within the graph fill-in-the-blank tasks. These tasks include the generative designation of \textit{de novo} molecules, linkers, fragments, scaffolds, and sidechains, all conditioned on the structures of protein pockets. Our evaluations are conducted with fairness, encompassing comprehensive perspectives on interaction, chemical properties, geometry authenticity, and substructure validity. We further provide the pre-trained versions of the state-of-the-art models and deep insights with analysis from empirical studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanming Yao, Yongqi Zhang, Yaqing Wang, Nan Yin, James Kwok, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling law, which involves the brute-force expansion of training datasets and learnable parameters, has become a prevalent strategy for developing more robust learning models. However, due to bottlenecks in data, computation, and trust, the sustainability of the scaling law is a serious concern for the future of deep learning. In this paper, we address this issue by developing next-generation models in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of relying on the scaling law. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as "building blocks" to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate the application of our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07668">How to Leverage Predictive Uncertainty Estimates for Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Serra, Ben Werner, Florian Buettner</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, RL research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard API for RL environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test RL algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of RL research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing RL algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for RL research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19580">Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Training of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dang Nguyen, Wenhan Yang, Rathul Anand, Yu Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced nature of the sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V -projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, and Zephyr with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Notably, CoLM easily stack with existing memory-efficient training methods, such as LoRA.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05177">Beyond Closure Models: Learning Chaotic-Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Operators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuwei Wang, Julius Berner, Zongyi Li, Di Zhou, Jiayun Wang, Jane Bae, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 330x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 10\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $60$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\sim186\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Yi, Zhewei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal research area for ensuring privacy protection, given the widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in applications involving sensitive user data. Among existing studies, certified graph unlearning is distinguished by providing robust privacy guarantees. However, current certified graph unlearning methods are impractical for large-scale graphs because they necessitate the costly re-computation of graph propagation for each unlearning request. Although numerous scalable techniques have been developed to accelerate graph propagation for GNNs, their integration into certified graph unlearning remains uncertain as these scalable approaches introduce approximation errors into node embeddings. In contrast, certified graph unlearning demands bounded model error on exact node embeddings to maintain its certified guarantee.
  To address this challenge, we present ScaleGUN, the first approach to scale certified graph unlearning to billion-edge graphs. ScaleGUN integrates the approximate graph propagation technique into certified graph unlearning, offering certified guarantees for three unlearning scenarios: node feature, edge, and node unlearning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and unlearning efficacy of ScaleGUN. Remarkably, ScaleGUN accomplishes $(\epsilon,\delta)=(1,10^{-4})$ certified unlearning on the billion-edge graph ogbn-papers100M in 20 seconds for a 5,000 random edge removal request -- of which only 5 seconds are required for updating the node embeddings -- compared to 1.91 hours for retraining and 1.89 hours for re-propagation.

<p>Abstract: The popularity of deep learning methods in the time series domain boosts interest in interpretability studies, including counterfactual (CF) methods. CF methods identify minimal changes in instances to alter the model predictions. Despite extensive research, no existing work benchmarks CF methods in the time series domain. Additionally, the results reported in the literature are inconclusive due to the limited number of datasets and inadequate metrics. In this work, we redesign quantitative metrics to accurately capture desirable characteristics in CFs. We specifically redesign the metrics for sparsity and plausibility and introduce a new metric for consistency. Combined with validity, generation time, and proximity, we form a comprehensive metric set. We systematically benchmark 6 different CF methods on 20 univariate datasets and 10 multivariate datasets with 3 different classifiers. Results indicate that the performance of CF methods varies across metrics and among different models. Finally, we provide case studies and a guideline for practical usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Lopez, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is relevant in various domains, ranging from healthcare to human-computer interaction. Physiological signals, being beyond voluntary control, offer reliable information for this purpose, unlike speech and facial expressions which can be controlled at will. They reflect genuine emotional responses, devoid of conscious manipulation, thereby enhancing the credibility of emotion recognition systems. Nonetheless, multimodal emotion recognition with deep learning models remains a relatively unexplored field. In this paper, we introduce a fully hypercomplex network with a hierarchical learning structure to fully capture correlations. Specifically, at the encoder level, the model learns intra-modal relations among the different channels of each input signal. Then, a hypercomplex fusion module learns inter-modal relations among the embeddings of the different modalities. The main novelty is in exploiting intra-modal relations by endowing the encoders with parameterized hypercomplex convolutions (PHCs) that thanks to hypercomplex algebra can capture inter-channel interactions within single modalities. Instead, the fusion module comprises parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can model inter-modal correlations. The proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset for emotion recognition, specifically in classifying valence and arousal from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Thuy, Ekaterina Loginova, Dries F. Benoit</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in research on Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Transformer-based neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance, primarily through supervised methods but with an isolated study in unsupervised learning. While supervised methods focus on predictive performance, they require abundant labeled data. On the other hand, unsupervised methods do not require labeled data but rely on a different evaluation metric that is also computationally expensive in practice. This work bridges the research gap by exploring active learning for QDE, a supervised human-in-the-loop approach striving to minimize the labeling efforts while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models. The active learning process iteratively trains on a labeled subset, acquiring labels from human experts only for the most informative unlabeled data points. Furthermore, we propose a novel acquisition function PowerVariance to add the most informative samples to the labeled set, a regression extension to the PowerBALD function popular in classification. We employ DistilBERT for QDE and identify informative samples by applying Monte Carlo dropout to capture epistemic uncertainty in unlabeled samples. The experiments demonstrate that active learning with PowerVariance acquisition achieves a performance close to fully supervised models after labeling only 10% of the training data. The proposed methodology promotes the responsible use of educational resources, makes QDE tools more accessible to course instructors, and is promising for other applications such as personalized support systems and question-answering tools.</p>

In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kin Wai Lau, Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman, Pedro Porto Buarque de Gusm\~ao, Lai-Man Po, Lan Ma, Yuyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving method for training machine learning models in a distributed manner on edge devices. However, on-device models face inherent computational power and memory limitations, potentially resulting in constrained gradient updates. As the model's size increases, the frequency of gradient updates on edge devices decreases, ultimately leading to suboptimal training outcomes during any particular FL round. This limits the feasibility of deploying advanced and large-scale models on edge devices, hindering the potential for performance enhancements. To address this issue, we propose FedRepOpt, a gradient re-parameterized optimizer for FL. The gradient re-parameterized method allows training a simple local model with a similar performance as a complex model by modifying the optimizer's gradients according to a set of model-specific hyperparameters obtained from the complex models. In this work, we focus on VGG-style and Ghost-style models in the FL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models using FedRepOpt obtain a significant boost in performance of 16.7% and 11.4% compared to the RepGhost-style and RepVGG-style networks, while also demonstrating a faster convergence time of 11.7% and 57.4% compared to their complex structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjing Wu, Junyu Xuan, Jie Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical parameter-space Bayesian inference for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) suffers from several unresolved prior issues, such as knowledge encoding intractability and pathological behaviours in deep networks, which can lead to improper posterior inference. To address these issues, functional Bayesian inference has recently been proposed leveraging functional priors, such as the emerging functional variational inference. In addition to variational methods, stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is another scalable and effective inference method for BNNs to asymptotically generate samples from the true posterior by simulating continuous dynamics. However, existing MCMC methods perform solely in parameter space and inherit the unresolved prior issues, while extending these dynamics to function space is a non-trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce novel functional MCMC schemes, including stochastic gradient versions, based on newly designed diffusion dynamics that can incorporate more informative functional priors. Moreover, we prove that the stationary measure of these functional dynamics is the target posterior over functions. Our functional MCMC schemes demonstrate improved performance in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification on several tasks compared to naive parameter-space MCMC and functional variational inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Franco, Mark Crovella</p>
<p>Abstract: Many papers have shown that attention heads work in conjunction with each other to perform complex tasks. It's frequently assumed that communication between attention heads is via the addition of specific features to token residuals. In this work we seek to isolate and identify the features used to effect communication and coordination among attention heads in GPT-2 small. Our key leverage on the problem is to show that these features are very often sparsely coded in the singular vectors of attention head matrices. We characterize the dimensionality and occurrence of these signals across the attention heads in GPT-2 small when used for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. The sparse encoding of signals, as provided by attention head singular vectors, allows for efficient separation of signals from the residual background and straightforward identification of communication paths between attention heads. We explore the effectiveness of this approach by tracing portions of the circuits used in the IOI task. Our traces reveal considerable detail not present in previous studies, shedding light on the nature of redundant paths present in GPT-2. And our traces go beyond previous work by identifying features used to communicate between attention heads when performing IOI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Feng, Xiang Kong, Shuang Ma, Aonan Zhang, Dong Yin, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting the multi-step reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a persistent challenge. Recently, verification has shown promise in improving solution consistency by evaluating generated outputs. However, current verification approaches suffer from sampling inefficiencies, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory performance. Additionally, training an effective verifier often depends on extensive process supervision, which is costly to acquire. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel verification method based on Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC). TSMC sequentially refines its sampling effort to focus exploration on promising candidates, resulting in more efficient generation of high-quality solutions. We apply TSMC to LLMs by estimating the expected future rewards at partial solutions. This approach results in a more straightforward training target that eliminates the need for step-wise human annotations. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our method across multiple math benchmarks, and also validate our theoretical analysis of both our approach and existing verification methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Xingjun Ma, Difan Zou, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua McClellan, Naveed Haghani, John Winder, Furong Huang, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiqiang Lin, Muning Wen, Qiuying Peng, Guanyu Nie, Junwei Liao, Jun Wang, Xiaoyun Mo, Jiamu Zhou, Cheng Cheng, Yin Zhao, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive value in performing as autonomous agents when equipped with external tools and API calls. Nonetheless, effectively harnessing their potential for executing complex tasks crucially relies on enhancements in their function calling capabilities. This paper identifies a critical gap in existing function calling models, where performance varies significantly across benchmarks, often due to being misled by specific naming conventions. To address such an issue, we introduce Hammer, a novel family of foundation models specifically engineered for on-device function calling. Hammer employs an augmented dataset that enhances models' sensitivity to irrelevant functions and incorporates function masking techniques to minimize misleading. Our empirical evaluations reveal that Hammer not only outperforms larger models but also demonstrates robust generalization across diverse benchmarks, achieving sota results. Our open source contributions include a specialized dataset for irrelevance detection, a tuning framework for enhanced generalization, and the Hammer models, establishing a new standard for function calling performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irene Cannistraci, Emanuele Rodol\`a, Bastian Rieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn similar internal representations, both across different models and within their own layers. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities present new opportunities for designing more efficient architectures. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of these internal similarities across different layers in diverse neural architectures, showing that similarity patterns emerge independently of the datataset used. We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy, to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toni J. B. Liu, Nicolas Boull\'e, Rapha\"el Sarfati, Christopher J. Earls</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p>

This paper derives error bounds for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in a Cell-free MIMO system and formulates an optimization problem to minimize optimality gap via joint optimization of power control and beamforming. We introduce the MOP-LOFPC algorithm, which employs Lyapunov optimization to decouple long-term constraints across rounds while requiring only causal channel state information. Experimental results demonstrate that MOP-LOFPC achieves a better and more flexible trade-off between the model's training loss and adherence to long-term power constraints compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meifan Zhang, Zhanhong Xie, Lihua Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces two primary challenges: the risk of privacy leakage due to parameter sharing and communication inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose DPSFL, a federated learning method that utilizes differentially private sketches. DPSFL compresses the local gradients of each client using a count sketch, thereby improving communication efficiency, while adding noise to the sketches to ensure differential privacy (DP). We provide a theoretical analysis of privacy and convergence for the proposed method. Gradient clipping is essential in DP learning to limit sensitivity and constrain the addition of noise. However, clipping introduces bias into the gradients, negatively impacting FL performance. To mitigate the impact of clipping, we propose an enhanced method, DPSFL-AC, which employs an adaptive clipping strategy. Experimental comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate the superiority of our methods concerning privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Connor W. Magoon, Fengyu Yang, Noam Aigerman, Shahar Z. Kovalsky</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, many deep learning approaches have incorporated layers that solve optimization problems (e.g., linear, quadratic, and semidefinite programs). Integrating these optimization problems as differentiable layers requires computing the derivatives of the optimization problem's solution with respect to its objective and constraints. This has so far prevented the use of state-of-the-art black-box numerical solvers within neural networks, as they lack a differentiable interface. To address this issue for one of the most common convex optimization problems -- quadratic programming (QP) -- we introduce dQP, a modular framework that enables plug-and-play differentiation for any QP solver, allowing seamless integration into neural networks and bi-level optimization tasks. Our solution is based on the core theoretical insight that knowledge of the active constraint set at the QP optimum allows for explicit differentiation. This insight reveals a unique relationship between the computation of the solution and its derivative, enabling efficient differentiation of any solver, that only requires the primal solution. Our implementation, which will be made publicly available, interfaces with an existing framework that supports over 15 state-of-the-art QP solvers, providing each with a fully differentiable backbone for immediate use as a differentiable layer in learning setups. To demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of dQP, we evaluate it on a large benchmark dataset of QPs with varying structures. We compare dQP with existing differentiable QP methods, demonstrating its advantages across a range of problems, from challenging small and dense problems to large-scale sparse ones, including a novel bi-level geometry optimization problem.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06648">Q-WSL:Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Weighted Supervised Learning in Goal-conditioned RL</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Lei, Xuetao Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxu Wang, Siwei Liu, Mengzhu Wang, Shangsong Liang, Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant attraction from both researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are only effective for in-distribution data and cannot tackle out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-aware Spiking Graph Domain Adaptation for Classification. The proposed DeSGDA addresses the spiking graph domain adaptation problem by three aspects: node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. First, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method for generating degree-dependent spiking signals. Specifically, the threshold of triggering a spike is determined by the node degree, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator. Such an alignment module can efficiently maintain high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed DeSGDA compared with competitive baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, training data attribution (TDA) methods have emerged as a promising direction for the interpretability of neural networks. While research around TDA is thriving, limited effort has been dedicated to the evaluation of attributions. Similar to the development of evaluation metrics for traditional feature attribution approaches, several standalone metrics have been proposed to evaluate the quality of TDA methods across various contexts. However, the lack of a unified framework that allows for systematic comparison limits trust in TDA methods and stunts their widespread adoption. To address this research gap, we introduce Quanda, a Python toolkit designed to facilitate the evaluation of TDA methods. Beyond offering a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, Quanda provides a uniform interface for seamless integration with existing TDA implementations across different repositories, thus enabling systematic benchmarking. The toolkit is user-friendly, thoroughly tested, well-documented, and available as an open-source library on PyPi and under https://github.com/dilyabareeva/quanda.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study contextual linear bandit problems under feature uncertainty, where the features are noisy and have missing entries. To address the challenges posed by this noise, we analyze Bayesian oracles given the observed noisy features. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that the optimal hypothesis can significantly deviate from the underlying realizability function, depending on the noise characteristics. These deviations are highly non-intuitive and do not occur in classical noiseless setups. This implies that classical approaches cannot guarantee a non-trivial regret bound. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that aims to approximate the Bayesian oracle based on the observed information under this model, achieving $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when there is a large number of arms. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Kallus, Xiaojie Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: In many experimental and observational studies, the outcome of interest is often difficult or expensive to observe, reducing effective sample sizes for estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) even when identifiable. We study how incorporating data on units for which only surrogate outcomes not of primary interest are observed can increase the precision of ATE estimation. We refrain from imposing stringent surrogacy conditions, which permit surrogates as perfect replacements for the target outcome. Instead, we supplement the available, albeit limited, observations of the target outcome with abundant observations of surrogate outcomes, without any assumptions beyond unconfounded treatment assignment and missingness and corresponding overlap conditions. To quantify the potential gains, we derive the difference in efficiency bounds on ATE estimation with and without surrogates, both when an overwhelming or comparable number of units have missing outcomes. We develop robust ATE estimation and inference methods that realize these efficiency gains. We empirically demonstrate the gains by studying long-term-earning effects of job training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study sequential bilateral trade where sellers and buyers valuations are completely arbitrary (i.e., determined by an adversary). Sellers and buyers are strategic agents with private valuations for the good and the goal is to design a mechanism that maximizes efficiency (or gain from trade) while being incentive compatible, individually rational and budget balanced. In this paper we consider gain from trade which is harder to approximate than social welfare.
  We consider a variety of feedback scenarios and distinguish the cases where the mechanism posts one price and when it can post different prices for buyer and seller. We show several surprising results about the separation between the different scenarios. In particular we show that (a) it is impossible to achieve sublinear $\alpha$-regret for any $\alpha<2$, (b) but with full feedback sublinear $2$-regret is achievable (c) with a single price and partial feedback one cannot get sublinear $\alpha$ regret for any constant $\alpha$ (d) nevertheless, posting two prices even with one-bit feedback achieves sublinear $2$-regret, and (e) there is a provable separation in the $2$-regret bounds between full and partial feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of answering observational, interventional, and counterfactual queries in a causally sufficient setting where only observational data and the causal graph are available. Utilizing the recent developments in diffusion models, we introduce diffusion-based causal models (DCM) to learn causal mechanisms, that generate unique latent encodings. These encodings enable us to directly sample under interventions and perform abduction for counterfactuals. Diffusion models are a natural fit here, since they can encode each node to a latent representation that acts as a proxy for exogenous noise. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for answering causal queries. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results that offer a methodology for analyzing counterfactual estimation in general encoder-decoder models, which could be useful in settings beyond our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Grohe</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyse the power of graph neural networks (GNNs) in terms of Boolean circuit complexity and descriptive complexity.
  We prove that the graph queries that can be computed by a polynomial-size bounded-depth family of GNNs are exactly those definable in the guarded fragment GFO+C of first-order logic with counting and with built-in relations. This puts GNNs in the circuit complexity class (non-uniform) TC^0. Remarkably, the GNN families may use arbitrary real weights and a wide class of activation functions that includes the standard ReLU, logistic "sigmod", and hyperbolic tangent functions. If the GNNs are allowed to use random initialisation and global readout (both standard features of GNNs widely used in practice), they can compute exactly the same queries as bounded depth Boolean circuits with threshold gates, that is, exactly the queries in TC^0.
  Moreover, we show that queries computable by a single GNN with piecewise linear activations and rational weights are definable in GFO+C without built-in relations. Therefore, they are contained in uniform TC^0.</p>

However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article we prove that the general transformer neural model undergirding modern large language models (LLMs) is Turing complete under reasonable assumptions. This is the first work to directly address the Turing completeness of the underlying technology employed in GPT-x as past work has focused on the more expressive, full auto-encoder transformer architecture. From this theoretical analysis, we show that the sparsity/compressibility of the word embedding is an important consideration for Turing completeness to hold. We also show that Transformers are are a variant of B machines studied by Hao Wang.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Benjamin, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and sometimes even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Matt Turner, Lisa Thiergart, Gavin Leech, David Udell, Juan J. Vazquez, Ulisse Mini, Monte MacDiarmid</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering and finetuning aim to maximize language model performance on a given metric (like toxicity reduction). However, these methods do not fully elicit a model's capabilities. To reduce this gap, we introduce activation engineering: the inference-time modification of activations in order to control (or steer) model outputs. Specifically, we introduce the Activation Addition (ActAdd) technique, which contrasts the intermediate activations on prompt pairs (such as "Love" versus "Hate") to compute a steering vector (Subramani et al. 2022). By tactically adding in e.g. the "Love" - "Hate" steering vector during the forward pass, we achieve SOTA on negative-to-positive sentiment shift and detoxification using models including LLaMA-3 and OPT. ActAdd yields inference-time control over high-level output properties (like topic and sentiment) while preserving performance on off-target tasks. ActAdd is lightweight: it does not require any machine optimization and works with a single pair of data points, which enables rapid iteration over steering. ActAdd demonstrates the power of activation engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Fornasier, Pascal Heid, Giacomo Enrico Sodini</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. We delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. We furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. We leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude. This allows evaluations over large datasets several times faster, including training, than traditional optimal transport algorithms. Our analytically designed deep learning architecture slightly outperforms the test error of state-of-the-art CNN architectures on datasets of images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model fusion research aims to aggregate the knowledge of multiple individual models to enhance performance by combining their weights. In this work, we study the inverse problem: investigating whether model fusion can be used to reduce unwanted knowledge. We investigate the effects of model fusion in three scenarios: the learning of shortcuts, social biases, and memorization of training data in fine-tuned language models. Through experiments covering classification and generation tasks, our analysis highlights that shared knowledge among models is enhanced during model fusion, while unshared knowledge is usually forgotten. Based on this observation, we demonstrate the potential of model fusion as a debiasing tool and showcase its efficacy in addressing privacy concerns associated with language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Ballotta, Nicol\`o Dal Fabbro, Giovanni Perin, Luca Schenato, Michele Rossi, Giuseppe Piro</p>
<p>Abstract: Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eszter Sz\'ekely, Lorenzo Bardone, Federica Gerace, Sebastian Goldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks excel at discovering statistical patterns in high-dimensional data sets. In practice, higher-order cumulants, which quantify the non-Gaussian correlations between three or more variables, are particularly important for the performance of neural networks. But how efficient are neural networks at extracting features from higher-order cumulants? We study this question in the spiked cumulant model, where the statistician needs to recover a privileged direction or "spike" from the order-$p\ge 4$ cumulants of $d$-dimensional inputs. Existing literature established the presence of a wide statistical-to-computational gap in this problem. We deepen this line of work by finding an exact formula for the likelihood ratio norm which proves that statistical distinguishability requires $n\gtrsim d$ samples, while distinguishing the two distributions in polynomial time requires $n \gtrsim d^2$ samples for a wide class of algorithms, i.e. those covered by the low-degree conjecture. Numerical experiments show that neural networks do indeed learn to distinguish the two distributions with quadratic sample complexity, while "lazy" methods like random features are not better than random guessing in this regime. Our results show that neural networks extract information from higher-ordercorrelations in the spiked cumulant model efficiently, and reveal a large gap in the amount of data required by neural networks and random features to learn from higher-order cumulants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Emre Sahin, Benjamin C. B. Symons, Pushpak Pati, Fayyaz Minhas, Declan Millar, Maria Gabrani, Stefano Mensa, Jan Lukas Robertus</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning with quantum kernels for classification problems is a growing area of research. Recently, quantum kernel alignment techniques that parameterise the kernel have been developed, allowing the kernel to be trained and therefore aligned with a specific dataset. While quantum kernel alignment is a promising technique, it has been hampered by considerable training costs because the full kernel matrix must be constructed at every training iteration. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel method that seeks to balance efficiency and performance. We present a sub-sampling training approach that uses a subset of the kernel matrix at each training step, thereby reducing the overall computational cost of the training. In this work, we apply the sub-sampling method to synthetic datasets and a real-world breast cancer dataset and demonstrate considerable reductions in the number of circuits required to train the quantum kernel while maintaining classification accuracy.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04783">Hyperbolic Machine Learning Moment Closures for the BGK Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew J. Christlieb, Mingchang Ding, Juntao Huang, Nicholas A. Krupansky</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a hyperbolic closure for the Grad moment expansion of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook's (BGK) kinetic model using a neural network (NN) trained on BGK's moment data. This closure is motivated by the exact closure for the free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport \cite{Huang2022-RTE1}. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that dealt with linear models, the BGK model's nonlinearity demanded advanced training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one cycle training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the \texttt{AdamW} optimizer. To address the non-conservative structure of the hyperbolic model, we adopt the FORCE numerical method to achieve robust solutions. This results in a comprehensive computing model combining learned closures with methods for solving hyperbolic models. The proposed model can capture accurate moment solutions across a broad spectrum of Knudsen numbers. Our paper details the multi-scale model construction and is run on a range of test problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxi Liu, Zimin Zhao, Daniel Gei{\ss}ler, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Neural Networks have significantly improved human activity recognition using multiple time-series sensors. While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan He, Zhangdie Yuan, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bjoern List, Li-Wei Chen, Kartik Bali, Nils Thuerey</p>
<p>Abstract: Unrolling training trajectories over time strongly influences the inference accuracy of neural network-augmented physics simulators. We analyze this in three variants of training neural time-steppers. In addition to one-step setups and fully differentiable unrolling, we include a third, less widely used variant: unrolling without temporal gradients. Comparing networks trained with these three modalities disentangles the two dominant effects of unrolling, training distribution shift and long-term gradients. We present detailed study across physical systems, network sizes and architectures, training setups, and test scenarios. It also encompasses two simulation modes: In prediction setups, we rely solely on neural networks to compute a trajectory. In contrast, correction setups include a numerical solver that is supported by a neural network. Spanning these variations, our study provides the empirical basis for our main findings: Non-differentiable but unrolled training with a numerical solver in a correction setup can yield substantial improvements over a fully differentiable prediction setup not utilizing this solver. The accuracy of models trained in a fully differentiable setup differs compared to their non-differentiable counterparts. Differentiable ones perform best in a comparison among correction networks as well as among prediction setups. For both, the accuracy of non-differentiable unrolling comes close. Furthermore, we show that these behaviors are invariant to the physical system, the network architecture and size, and the numerical scheme. These results motivate integrating non-differentiable numerical simulators into training setups even if full differentiability is unavailable. We show the convergence rate of common architectures to be low compared to numerical algorithms. This motivates correction setups combining neural and numerical parts which utilize benefits of both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) emerges as a promising technique to elicit reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions around its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and answer in both LLMs and humans. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from a causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answer). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size, urging research on new techniques. We hope this preliminary study will shed light on the understanding and further improvement of the reasoning process in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Emmanouilidis, Ren\'e Vidal, Nicolas Loizou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for solving finite-sum min-max optimization and variational inequality problems (VIPs) appearing in various machine learning tasks. However, existing convergence analyses of SEG focus on its with-replacement variants, while practical implementations of the method randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them. Unlike the well-studied with-replacement variants, SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) lacks established theoretical guarantees. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of SEG-RR for three classes of VIPs: (i) strongly monotone, (ii) affine, and (iii) monotone. We derive conditions under which SEG-RR achieves a faster convergence rate than the uniform with-replacement sampling SEG. In the monotone setting, our analysis of SEG-RR guarantees convergence to an arbitrary accuracy without large batch sizes, a strong requirement needed in the classical with-replacement SEG. As a byproduct of our results, we provide convergence guarantees for Shuffle Once SEG (shuffles the data only at the beginning of the algorithm) and the Incremental Extragradient (does not shuffle the data). We supplement our analysis with experiments validating empirically the superior performance of SEG-RR over the classical with-replacement sampling SEG.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter), an advanced speculative decoding approach that achieves state-of-the-art speedup for large language models (LLMs) inference. The performance gains are driven by three key aspects: (1) leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the draft model conditioning on LLM's hidden states, (2) applying a dynamic tree attention algorithm over beam search results to eliminate duplicated prefixes in candidate sequences, and (3) training through knowledge distillation from the LLM. ReDrafter accelerates Vicuna inference in MT-Bench by up to 3.5x with a PyTorch implementation on Nvidia H100 GPUs. To demonstrate its practicality in production environments, we integrate ReDrafter into TensorRT-LLM, reaching up to 2.5x speedup on H100 GPUs. We also validated its effectiveness for on-device applications by implementing the approach in MLX and benchmarking performance on Metal GPUs in Apple Silicon chips, achieving up to 2.3x speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bang Nguyen, Mengxia Yu, Yun Huang, Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reference-based metrics such as BLEU and BERTScore are widely used to evaluate question generation (QG). In this study, on QG benchmarks such as SQuAD and HotpotQA, we find that using human-written references cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the reference-based metrics. Most QG benchmarks have only one reference; we replicate the annotation process and collect another reference. A good metric is expected to grade a human-validated question no worse than generated questions. However, the results of reference-based metrics on our newly collected reference disproved the metrics themselves. We propose a reference-free metric consisted of multi-dimensional criteria such as naturalness, answerability, and complexity, utilizing large language models. These criteria are not constrained to the syntactic or semantic of a single reference question, and the metric does not require a diverse set of references. Experiments reveal that our metric accurately distinguishes between high-quality questions and flawed ones, and achieves state-of-the-art alignment with human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsu Kim, Jaemin Kim, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Schrodi, David T. Hoffmann, Max Argus, Volker Fischer, Thomas Brox</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, have gained popularity for their versatile applicability to various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot object recognition, they perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute recognition. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and to a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this analysis paper, we investigate both phenomena thoroughly. We evaluated off-the-shelf VLMs and find that while the gap's influence on performance is typically overshadowed by other factors, we find indications that closing the gap indeed leads to improvements. Moreover, we find that, contrary to intuition, only few embedding dimensions drive the gap and that the embedding spaces are differently organized. To allow for a clean study of object bias, we introduce a definition and a corresponding measure of it. Equipped with this tool, we find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes per se. However, why do both phenomena, modality gap and object bias, emerge in the first place? To answer this fundamental question and uncover some of the inner workings of contrastive VLMs, we conducted experiments that allowed us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. These experiments revealed that the driving factor behind both the modality gap and the object bias, is an information imbalance between images and captions, and unveiled an intriguing connection between the modality gap and entropy of the logits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulation-based methods for statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimization libraries and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortized, in the sense that, after an initial setup cost, they allow rapid inference through fast feed-forward operations. In this article we review recent progress in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, summary-statistic construction, and likelihood approximation. We also cover software, and include a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortized inference and the benefits they offer over Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakan Aktas, Yukie Nagai, Minoru Asada, Matteo Saveriano, Erhan Oztop, Emre Ugur</p>
<p>Abstract: Affordances represent the inherent effect and action possibilities that objects offer to the agents within a given context. From a theoretical viewpoint, affordances bridge the gap between effect and action, providing a functional understanding of the connections between the actions of an agent and its environment in terms of the effects it can cause. In this study, we propose a deep neural network model that unifies objects, actions, and effects into a single latent vector in a common latent space that we call the affordance space. Using the affordance space, our system can generate effect trajectories when action and object are given and can generate action trajectories when effect trajectories and objects are given. Our model does not learn the behavior of individual objects acted upon by a single agent. Still, rather, it forms a `shared affordance representation' spanning multiple agents and objects, which we call Affordance Equivalence. Affordance Equivalence facilitates not only action generalization over objects but also Cross Embodiment transfer linking actions of different robots. In addition to the simulation experiments that demonstrate the proposed model's range of capabilities, we also showcase that our model can be used for direct imitation in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions in a prospectively accelerated scenario to reflect real-world clinical applications and evaluated their adaptability to MRCP at 0.55T. Both DL reconstructions demonstrated a remarkable reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling scenarios, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Zecchin, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive Risk Control (ARC) is an online calibration strategy based on set prediction that offers worst-case deterministic long-term risk control, as well as statistical marginal coverage guarantees. ARC adjusts the size of the prediction set by varying a single scalar threshold based on feedback from past decisions. In this work, we introduce Localized Adaptive Risk Control (L-ARC), an online calibration scheme that targets statistical localized risk guarantees ranging from conditional risk to marginal risk, while preserving the worst-case performance of ARC. L-ARC updates a threshold function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the kernel determining the level of localization of the statistical risk guarantee. The theoretical results highlight a trade-off between localization of the statistical risk and convergence speed to the long-term risk target. Thanks to localization, L-ARC is demonstrated via experiments to produce prediction sets with risk guarantees across different data subpopulations, significantly improving the fairness of the calibrated model for tasks such as image segmentation and beam selection in wireless networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Hong, William Agnew, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jamie Morgenstern</p>
<p>Abstract: As training datasets become increasingly drawn from unstructured, uncontrolled environments such as the web, researchers and industry practitioners have increasingly relied upon data filtering techniques to "filter out the noise" of web-scraped data. While datasets have been widely shown to reflect the biases and values of their creators, in this paper we contribute to an emerging body of research that assesses the filters used to create these datasets. We show that image-text data filtering also has biases and is value-laden, encoding specific notions of what is counted as "high-quality" data. In our work, we audit a standard approach of image-text CLIP-filtering on the academic benchmark DataComp's CommonPool by analyzing discrepancies of filtering through various annotation techniques across multiple modalities of image, text, and website source. We find that data relating to several imputed demographic groups -- such as LGBTQ+ people, older women, and younger men -- are associated with higher rates of exclusion. Moreover, we demonstrate cases of exclusion amplification: not only are certain marginalized groups already underrepresented in the unfiltered data, but CLIP-filtering excludes data from these groups at higher rates. The data-filtering step in the machine learning pipeline can therefore exacerbate representation disparities already present in the data-gathering step, especially when existing filters are designed to optimize a specifically-chosen downstream performance metric like zero-shot image classification accuracy. Finally, we show that the NSFW filter fails to remove sexually-explicit content from CommonPool, and that CLIP-filtering includes several categories of copyrighted content at high rates. Our conclusions point to a need for fundamental changes in dataset creation and filtering practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijia Jiang, David Nabergoj</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging connections between diffusion-based sampling, optimal transport, and stochastic optimal control through their shared links to the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, we propose novel objective functions that can be used to transport $\nu$ to $\mu$, consequently sample from the target $\mu$, via optimally controlled dynamics. We highlight the importance of the pathwise perspective and the role various optimality conditions on the path measure can play for the design of valid training losses, the careful choice of which offer numerical advantages in implementation. Basing the formalism on Schr\"odinger bridge comes with the additional practical capability of baking in inductive bias when it comes to Neural Network training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Lukoianov, Haitz S\'aez de Oc\'ariz Borde, Kristjan Greenewald, Vitor Campagnolo Guizilini, Timur Bagautdinov, Vincent Sitzmann, Justin Solomon</p>
<p>Abstract: While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) built on these 2D diffusion models produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dehong Xu, Ruiqi Gao, Wen-Hao Zhang, Xue-Xin Wei, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to identify novel and impactful ideas, especially across disciplines. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer new approaches, potentially inspiring ideas not conceived by humans alone. But how compelling are these AI-generated ideas, and how can we improve their quality? Here, we introduce SciMuse, which uses 58 million research papers and a large-language model to generate research ideas. We conduct a large-scale evaluation in which over 100 research group leaders - from natural sciences to humanities - ranked more than 4,400 personalized ideas based on their interest. This data allows us to predict research interest using (1) supervised neural networks trained on human evaluations, and (2) unsupervised zero-shot ranking with large-language models. Our results demonstrate how future systems can help generating compelling research ideas and foster unforeseen interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin You, Xinyu Zhang, Hanzhong Guo, Jingdong Wang, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The ultimate goal of generative models is to perfectly capture the data distribution. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghuan Sun, Alexander Schubert, Gregory M. Goldgof, Zhiqing Sun, Thomas Hartvigsen, Atul J. Butte, Ahmed Alaa</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) can support clinicians by analyzing medical images and engaging in natural language interactions to assist in diagnostic and treatment tasks. However, VLMs often exhibit "hallucinogenic" behavior, generating textual outputs not grounded in contextual multimodal information. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the medical domain, where we do not only require VLM outputs to be accurate in single interactions but also to be consistent with clinical reasoning and diagnostic pathways throughout multi-turn conversations. For this purpose, we propose a new alignment algorithm that uses symbolic representations of clinical reasoning to ground VLMs in medical knowledge. These representations are utilized to (i) generate GPT-4-guided visual instruction tuning data at scale, simulating clinician-VLM conversations with demonstrations of clinical reasoning, and (ii) create an automatic reward function that evaluates the clinical validity of VLM generations throughout clinician-VLM interactions. Our algorithm eliminates the need for human involvement in training data generation or reward model construction, reducing costs compared to standard reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We apply our alignment algorithm to develop Dr-LLaVA, a conversational VLM finetuned for analyzing bone marrow pathology slides, demonstrating strong performance in multi-turn medical conversations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Qiu, Douglas E. Lake, Pavel Chernyavskiy, Teague R. Henry</p>
<p>Abstract: For prediction models developed on clustered data that do not account for cluster heterogeneity in model parameterization, it is crucial to use cluster-based validation to assess model generalizability on unseen clusters. This paper introduces a clustered estimator of the Network Information Criterion (NICc) to approximate leave-one-cluster-out deviance for standard prediction models with twice differentiable log-likelihood functions. The NICc serves as a fast alternative to cluster-based cross-validation. Stone (1977) proved that the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation for true parametric models with independent and identically distributed observations. Ripley (1996) noted that the Network Information Criterion (NIC), derived from Stone's proof, is a better approximation when the model is misspecified. For clustered data, we derived NICc by substituting the Fisher information matrix in the NIC with a clustering-adjusted estimator. The NICc imposes a greater penalty when the data exhibits stronger clustering, thereby allowing the NICc to better prevent over-parameterization. In a simulation study and an empirical example, we used standard regression to develop prediction models for clustered data with Gaussian or binomial responses. Compared to the commonly used AIC and BIC for standard regression, NICc provides a much more accurate approximation to leave-one-cluster-out deviance and results in more accurate model size and variable selection, as determined by cluster-based cross-validation, especially when the data exhibit strong clustering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational prediction of the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) and their ligands is a grand challenge in immunology. Despite advances in high-throughput assays, specificity-labelled TCR data remains sparse. In other domains, the pre-training of language models on unlabelled data has been successfully used to address data bottlenecks. However, it is unclear how to best pre-train protein language models for TCR specificity prediction. Here we introduce a TCR language model called SCEPTR (Simple Contrastive Embedding of the Primary sequence of T cell Receptors), capable of data-efficient transfer learning. Through our model, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy combining autocontrastive learning and masked-language modelling, which enables SCEPTR to achieve its state-of-the-art performance. In contrast, existing protein language models and a variant of SCEPTR pre-trained without autocontrastive learning are outperformed by sequence alignment-based methods. We anticipate that contrastive learning will be a useful paradigm to decode the rules of TCR specificity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Xueyan Zou, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning provides a promising solution to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for code language models, where the model is not explicitly trained to differentiate between correct and incorrect code. Recent findings demonstrate that on-policy data is the key to successful preference learning, where the preference data is collected using the same policy LM being trained. Inspired by this, we propose PLUM, an on-policy $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{L}$earning framework A$\textbf{u}$gmented with test cases for code L$\textbf{M}$ s. The framework operates in three key stages: (1) automatic generation of test cases from natural language instructions, (2) creation of a preference data by evaluating candidate code solutions sampled from the policy, which can then be used to (3) train the policy LM. PLUM levitates the need to train reward models, allowing for large scale on-policy and online preference data collation. PLUM is evaluated on both standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) and more challenging ones (LiveCodeBench), delivering substantial improvements over original SFT'ed models and other execution-feedback-driven approaches. We show PLUM's benefits are consistent across various widely-used code LMs even they have been well-trained with SFT. For example, PLUM increases pass rates by up to 4.8% on average on standard benchmarks and 11.8% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. We also demonstrate the benefits of on-policy and online preference learning by comprehensive experimentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Lohn, Sean Welleck</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents have shown initial promise in automating mathematical theorem proving in proof assistants such as Lean. The same proof assistants can be used to verify the correctness of code by pairing code with specifications and proofs that the specifications hold. Automating the writing of code, specifications, and proofs could lower the cost of verification, or, ambitiously, enable an AI agent to output safe, provably correct code. However, it remains unclear whether current neural theorem provers can automatically verify even relatively simple programs. We present miniCodeProps, a benchmark of 201 program specifications in the Lean proof assistant, aimed at the subproblem of automatically generating a proof for a provided program and specification. miniCodeProps contains specifications about simple, self-contained programs (e.g., lists, natural numbers, binary trees) with varied proof difficulty. Despite its simplicity, miniCodeProps is sufficient to break current LLM-based provers, with state-of-the-art methods showing promise on the easy properties in miniCodeProps, yet failing to prove nearly all of the medium and hard properties. We publicly release miniCodeProps as a benchmark for furthering automated theorem proving in the context of formally verified code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoni Choukroun, Lior Wolf</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern, especially for short block lengths. As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a gradient-based data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning of the Factor graph under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel complete graph tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation and coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim R. Davidson, Viacheslav Surkov, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giuseppe Russo, Robert West, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: A rapidly growing number of applications rely on a small set of closed-source language models (LMs). This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated "security questions". Our test can be externally administered to monitor frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the "best" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</p>

Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Bodin, Carl Henrik Ek, Henry Moss</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from generative models has become a crucial tool for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. For search-based or creative applications that require additional control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG) as a general purpose interpolation method that is easy to implement yet outperforms recent sophisticated methods. Moreover, COG naturally addresses the broader task of forming general linear combinations of latent variables, allowing the construction of subspaces of the latent space, dramatically simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point system with single-input single-output (SISO) for communication and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) for sensing within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer bounds (OB). We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-Cram\'er-Rao bound (R-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: i) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and ii) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Foti, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Tolga Birdal</p>
<p>Abstract: Seams, distortions, wasted UV space, vertex-duplication, and varying resolution over the surface are the most prominent issues of the standard UV-based texturing of meshes. These issues are particularly acute when automatic UV-unwrapping techniques are used. For this reason, instead of generating textures in automatically generated UV-planes like most state-of-the-art methods, we propose to represent textures as coloured point-clouds whose colours are generated by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model constrained to operate on the surface of 3D objects. Our sampling and resolution agnostic generative model heavily relies on heat diffusion over the surface of the meshes for spatial communication between points. To enable processing of arbitrarily sampled point-cloud textures and ensure long-distance texture consistency we introduce a fast re-sampling of the mesh spectral properties used during the heat diffusion and introduce a novel heat-diffusion-based self-attention mechanism. Our code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/simofoti/UV3-TeD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Wang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) have significantly enhanced zero-shot medical vision tasks such as image classification by leveraging large-scale medical image-text pair pre-training. However, the performance of these tasks can be heavily influenced by the variability in textual prompts describing the categories, necessitating robustness in MedVLP models to diverse prompt styles. Yet, this sensitivity remains underexplored. In this work, we are the first to systematically assess the sensitivity of three widely-used MedVLP methods to a variety of prompts across 15 different diseases. To achieve this, we designed six unique prompt styles to mirror real clinical scenarios, which were subsequently ranked by interpretability. Our findings indicate that all MedVLP models evaluated show unstable performance across different prompt styles, suggesting a lack of robustness. Additionally, the models' performance varied with increasing prompt interpretability, revealing difficulties in comprehending complex medical concepts. This study underscores the need for further development in MedVLP methodologies to enhance their robustness to diverse zero-shot prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmohammad Farzaneh, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) problem is a widely studied framework in machine learning for extracting compressed features that are informative for downstream tasks. However, current approaches to solving the IB problem rely on a heuristic tuning of hyperparameters, offering no guarantees that the learned features satisfy information-theoretic constraints. In this work, we introduce a statistically valid solution to this problem, referred to as IB via multiple hypothesis testing (IB-MHT), which ensures that the learned features meet the IB constraints with high probability, regardless of the size of the available dataset. The proposed methodology builds on Pareto testing and learn-then-test (LTT), and it wraps around existing IB solvers to provide statistical guarantees on the IB constraints. We demonstrate the performance of IB-MHT on classical and deterministic IB formulations, including experiments on distillation of language models. The results validate the effectiveness of IB-MHT in outperforming conventional methods in terms of statistical robustness and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaosong Lu, Sanyou Mei, Yifeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that these methods respectively achieve a sample and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{\theta+2, 2\theta\}})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. For $\theta=1$, these complexities reduce to $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-4})$ respectively, which match, up to a logarithmic factor, the best-known complexities achieved by existing methods for finding an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point of unconstrained smooth stochastic optimization problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Arcadinho, David Aparicio, Mariana Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented LLMs are a promising approach to create AI agents that can have realistic conversations, follow procedures, and call appropriate functions. However, evaluating them is challenging due to the diversity of possible conversations, and existing datasets focus only on single interactions and function-calling. We present a test generation pipeline to evaluate LLMs as conversational AI agents. Our framework uses LLMs to generate diverse tests grounded on user-defined procedures. For that, we use intermediate graphs to limit the LLM test generator's tendency to hallucinate content that is not grounded on input procedures, and enforces high coverage of the possible conversations. Additionally, we put forward ALMITA, a manually curated dataset for evaluating AI agents in customer support, and use it to evaluate existing LLMs. Our results show that while tool-augmented LLMs perform well in single interactions, they often struggle to handle complete conversations. While our focus is on customer support, our method is general and capable of AI agents for different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Han, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Shilong Bao, Peisong Wen, Yangbangyan Jiang, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a well-known metric for evaluating instance-level long-tail learning problems. In the past two decades, many AUC optimization methods have been proposed to improve model performance under long-tail distributions. In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm's generalization ability. Additionally, we design a Tail-Classes Memory Bank (T-Memory Bank) to manage the significant memory demand. Finally, comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed AUCSeg method. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/AUCSeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Senkang Hu, Hangcheng Cao, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han He, Qianchu Liu, Lei Xu, Chaitanya Shivade, Yi Zhang, Sundararajan Srinivasan, Katrin Kirchhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are typically designed for discriminative tasks, where new task prompts are iteratively refined with limited feedback from a single metric reflecting a single aspect. However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyun He, Yepeng Liu, Ziqiao Wang, Yongyi Mao, Yuheng Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) boosts human efficiency but also poses misuse risks, with watermarking serving as a reliable method to differentiate AI-generated content from human-created text. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework for watermarking LLMs. Particularly, we jointly optimize both the watermarking scheme and detector to maximize detection performance, while controlling the worst-case Type-I error and distortion in the watermarked text. Within our framework, we characterize the universally minimum Type-II error, showing a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and distortion. More importantly, we identify the optimal type of detectors and watermarking schemes. Building upon our theoretical analysis, we introduce a practical, model-agnostic and computationally efficient token-level watermarking algorithm that invokes a surrogate model and the Gumbel-max trick. Empirical results on Llama-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we also explore how robustness can be integrated into our theoretical framework, which provides a foundation for designing future watermarking systems with improved resilience to adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiteng Li, Xianglong Yan, Tianao Zhang, Haotong Qin, Dong Xie, Jiang Tian, zhongchao shi, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size.

<p>Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjian Li, Haoran Xu, Weiting Tan, Kenton Murray, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data availability across domains often follows a long-tail distribution: a few domains have abundant data, while most face dat . a scarcity. This imbalance poses challenges in training language models uniformly across all domains. In our study, we focus on multilingual settings, where data sizes vary significantly between high- and low-resource languages. Common strategies to address this include upsampling low-resource languages (Temperature Sampling) or upweighting their loss (Scalarization). Although often considered equivalent, this assumption has not been proven, which motivates our study. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent and when they diverge. Specifically, we demonstrate that these two methods are equivalent under full gradient descent, but this equivalence breaks down with stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, we observe that Temperature Sampling converges more quickly but is prone to overfitting. We argue that this faster convergence is likely due to the lower variance in gradient estimations, as shown theoretically. Based on these insights, we propose Cooldown, a strategy that reduces sampling temperature during training, accelerating convergence without overfitting to low-resource languages. Our method is competitive with existing data re-weighting and offers computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachun Li, David Simchi-Levi, Yunxiao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Given n experiment subjects with potentially heterogeneous covariates and two possible treatments, namely active treatment and control, this paper addresses the fundamental question of determining the optimal accuracy in estimating the treatment effect. Furthermore, we propose an experimental design that approaches this optimal accuracy, giving a (non-asymptotic) answer to this fundamental yet still open question. The methodological contribution is listed as following. First, we establish an idealized optimal estimator with minimal variance as benchmark, and then demonstrate that adaptive experiment is necessary to achieve near-optimal estimation accuracy. Secondly, by incorporating the concept of doubly robust method into sequential experimental design, we frame the optimal estimation problem as an online bandit learning problem, bridging the two fields of statistical estimation and bandit learning. Using tools and ideas from both bandit algorithm design and adaptive statistical estimation, we propose a general low switching adaptive experiment framework, which could be a generic research paradigm for a wide range of adaptive experimental design. Through information-theoretic lower bound combined with Bayes risk analysis, we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed experiment. Numerical result indicates that the estimation accuracy approaches optimal with as few as two or three policy updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Kirchhof, James Thornton, Pierre Ablin, Louis B\'ethune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Steinke, Milad Nasr, Arun Ganesh, Borja Balle, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Jamie Hayes, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Adam Smith, Andreas Terzis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a simple heuristic privacy analysis of noisy clipped stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) in the setting where only the last iterate is released and the intermediate iterates remain hidden. Namely, our heuristic assumes a linear structure for the model.
  We show experimentally that our heuristic is predictive of the outcome of privacy auditing applied to various training procedures. Thus it can be used prior to training as a rough estimate of the final privacy leakage. We also probe the limitations of our heuristic by providing some artificial counterexamples where it underestimates the privacy leakage.
  The standard composition-based privacy analysis of DP-SGD effectively assumes that the adversary has access to all intermediate iterates, which is often unrealistic. However, this analysis remains the state of the art in practice. While our heuristic does not replace a rigorous privacy analysis, it illustrates the large gap between the best theoretical upper bounds and the privacy auditing lower bounds and sets a target for further work to improve the theoretical privacy analyses. We also empirically support our heuristic and show existing privacy auditing attacks are bounded by our heuristic analysis in both vision and language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Ashman, Cristiana Diaconu, Eric Langezaal, Adrian Weller, Richard E. Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p>
