<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthis Manthe (LIRIS, CREATIS), Carole Lartizien (MYRIAD), Stefan Duffner (LIRIS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical studies show that federated learning exhibits convergence issues in Non Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) setups. However, these studies only focus on label distribution shifts, or concept shifts (e.g. ambiguous tasks). In this paper, we explore for the first time the effect of covariate shifts between participants' data in 2D segmentation tasks, showing an impact way less serious than label shifts but still present on convergence. Moreover, current Personalized (PFL) and Clustered (CFL) Federated Learning methods intrinsically assume the homogeneity of the dataset of each participant and its consistency with future test samples by operating at the client level. We introduce a more general and realistic framework where each participant owns a mixture of multiple underlying feature domain distributions. To diagnose such pathological feature distributions affecting a model being trained in a federated fashion, we develop Deep Domain Isolation (DDI) to isolate image domains directly in the gradient space of the model. A federated Gaussian Mixture Model is fit to the sample gradients of each class, while the results are combined with spectral clustering on the server side to isolate decentralized sample-level domains. We leverage this clustering algorithm through a Sample Clustered Federated Learning (SCFL) framework, performing standard federated learning of several independent models, one for each decentralized image domain. Finally, we train a classifier enabling to associate a test sample to its corresponding domain cluster at inference time, offering a final set of models that are agnostic to any assumptions on the test distribution of each participant. We validate our approach on a toy segmentation dataset as well as different partitionings of a combination of Cityscapes and GTA5 datasets using an EfficientVIT-B0 model, showing a significant performance gain compared to other approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Adamiak, Yulia Grinblat, Julian Psotta, Nir Fulman, Himshikhar Mazumdar, Shiyu Tang, Alexander Zipf</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and estimating vehicle speeds using PlanetScope SuperDove satellite imagery, offering a scalable solution for global vehicle traffic monitoring. Conventional methods such as stationary sensors and mobile systems like UAVs are limited in coverage and constrained by high costs and legal restrictions. Satellite-based approaches provide broad spatial coverage but face challenges, including high costs, low frame rates, and difficulty detecting small vehicles in high-resolution imagery. We propose a Keypoint R-CNN model to track vehicle trajectories across RGB bands, leveraging band timing differences to estimate speed. Validation is performed using drone footage and GPS data covering highways in Germany and Poland. Our model achieved a Mean Average Precision of 0.53 and velocity estimation errors of approximately 3.4 m/s compared to GPS data. Results from drone comparison reveal underestimations, with average speeds of 112.85 km/h for satellite data versus 131.83 km/h from drone footage. While challenges remain with high-speed accuracy, this approach demonstrates the potential for scalable, daily traffic monitoring across vast areas, providing valuable insights into global traffic dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Anand, Elyas Rashno, Amir Eskandari, Farhana Zulkernine</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network. Project Page: https://23wm13.github.io/distill-dkp/</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14705">Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulo Luza Alves, Andr\'e Hochuli, Luiz Eduardo de Oliveira, Paulo Lisboa de Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city applications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be sent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging for the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require transmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware infrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based parking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of classifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into lightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on edge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through pseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to fine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the Student models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models, achieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing the Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Wu, Christian Desrosiers, Ahmad Chaddad</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to medical image analysis that allows deep model training using decentralized data while ensuring data privacy. However, in the field of FL, communication cost plays a critical role in evaluating the performance of the model. Thus, transferring vision foundation models can be particularly challenging due to the significant resource costs involved. In this paper, we introduce a federated adaptive Contrastive Language Image Pretraining CLIP model designed for classification tasks. We employ a light-weight and efficient feature attention module for CLIP that selects suitable features for each client's data. Additionally, we propose a domain adaptation technique to reduce differences in data distribution between clients. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FACMIC in dealing with real-world and multisource medical imaging data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Murata, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Yuhta Takida, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Bac Nguyen, Stefano Ermon, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent literature has effectively utilized diffusion models trained on continuous variables as priors for solving inverse problems. Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging image-generation models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use discrete diffusion model-based priors for solving image inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Wu, Zien Huang, Chonghan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Paleontology, the study of past life, fundamentally relies on fossils to reconstruct ancient ecosystems and understand evolutionary dynamics. Trilobites, as an important group of extinct marine arthropods, offer valuable insights into Paleozoic environments through their well-preserved fossil records. Reconstructing trilobite behaviour from static fossils will set new standards for dynamic reconstructions in scientific research and education. Despite the potential, current computational methods for this purpose like text-to-video (T2V) face significant challenges, such as maintaining visual realism and consistency, which hinder their application in science contexts. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce an automatic T2V prompt learning method. Within this framework, prompts for a fine-tuned video generation model are generated by a large language model, which is trained using rewards that quantify the visual realism and smoothness of the generated video. The fine-tuning of the video generation model, along with the reward calculations make use of a collected dataset of 9,088 Eoredlichia intermedia fossil images, which provides a common representative of visual details of all class of trilobites. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method can generate trilobite videos with significantly higher visual realism compared to powerful baselines, promising to boost both scientific understanding and public engagement.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14729">Tokens on Demand: Token Condensation as Training-free Test-time Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Wang, Dong Gong, Sen Wang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free approach designed to mitigate distribution shifts encountered by vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. TCA bridges distribution gaps at the patch level by condensing image tokens that exhibit low attentiveness to the <cls> token. Recognizing the <cls> token may correspond to universal concepts, TCA identifies and tracks the most reliable <cls> tokens that align specifically with target classes from historical data streams. To achieve this, we propose a context token reservoir (CTR), which retains tokens with the lowest uncertainty as ``anchors" to guide the preservation of class-relevant tokens during inference. These anchors, in turn, act as token-level classifiers to correct VLM predictions and improve visual-text alignment. Utilizing anchors sampled from CTR, TCA condenses tokens through two operations: (1) pruning class-irrelevant tokens that consistently rank low across all attention heads to reach cross-head consensus on their irrelevance, and (2) merging the remaining class-ambiguous tokens into representative centers using coreset selection, maintaining linear computational complexity. As the first method to explore token efficiency in test-time adaptation, TCA consistently demonstrates superior performance across cross-dataset and out-of-distribution adaptation tasks, reducing GFLOPs by 12.2% to 48.9% while achieving accuracy improvements up to 21.4% against the strongest baseline without introducing additional parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a complete object from its parts is a fundamental problem in many scientific domains. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic survey on this topic. The reassembly problem requires understanding the attributes of individual pieces and establishing matches between different pieces. Many approaches also model priors of the underlying complete object. Existing approaches are tightly connected problems of shape segmentation, shape matching, and learning shape priors. We provide existing algorithms in this context and emphasize their similarities and differences to general-purpose approaches. We also survey the trends from early non-deep learning approaches to more recent deep learning approaches. In addition to algorithms, this survey will also describe existing datasets, open-source software packages, and applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on this topic in computer graphics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14790">SSL-NBV: A Self-Supervised-Learning-Based Next-Best-View algorithm for Efficient 3D Plant Reconstruction by a Robot</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchao Ci, Eldert J. van Henten, Xin Wang, Akshay K. Burusa, Gert Kootstra</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D reconstruction of plants is challenging due to their complex shape causing many occlusions. Next-Best-View (NBV) methods address this by iteratively selecting new viewpoints to maximize information gain (IG). Deep-learning-based NBV (DL-NBV) methods demonstrate higher computational efficiency over classic voxel-based NBV approaches but current methods require extensive training using ground-truth plant models, making them impractical for real-world plants. These methods, moreover, rely on offline training with pre-collected data, limiting adaptability in changing agricultural environments. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning-based NBV method (SSL-NBV) that uses a deep neural network to predict the IG for candidate viewpoints. The method allows the robot to gather its own training data during task execution by comparing new 3D sensor data to the earlier gathered data and by employing weakly-supervised learning and experience replay for efficient online learning. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in simulation and real-world environments using cross-validation. The results showed that SSL-NBV required fewer views for plant reconstruction than non-NBV methods and was over 800 times faster than a voxel-based method. SSL-NBV reduced training annotations by over 90% compared to a baseline DL-NBV. Furthermore, SSL-NBV could adapt to novel scenarios through online fine-tuning. Also using real plants, the results showed that the proposed method can learn to effectively plan new viewpoints for 3D plant reconstruction. Most importantly, SSL-NBV automated the entire network training and uses continuous online learning, allowing it to operate in changing agricultural environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a method to detect generic dynamic objects for automated driving. First, a LiDAR-based dynamic grid is generated online. Second, a deep learning-based detector is trained on the dynamic grid to infer the presence of dynamic objects of any type, which is a prerequisite for safe automated vehicles in arbitrary, edge-case scenarios. The Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) - originally designed for oriented object detection on aerial images - was chosen due to its high detection performance. Experiments are conducted based on real sensor data and the benefits in comparison to classic dynamic cell clustering strategies are highlighted. The false positive object detection rate is strongly reduced by the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Zhang, Lihui Wang, Kun Tang, Jingwen Xu, Hongjiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, cortical surface registration techniques based on classical methods have been well developed. However, a key issue with classical methods is that for each pair of images to be registered, it is necessary to search for the optimal transformation in the deformation space according to a specific optimization algorithm until the similarity measure function converges, which cannot meet the requirements of real-time and high-precision in medical image registration. Researching cortical surface registration based on deep learning models has become a new direction. But so far, there are still only a few studies on cortical surface image registration based on deep learning. Moreover, although deep learning methods theoretically have stronger representation capabilities, surpassing the most advanced classical methods in registration accuracy and distortion control remains a challenge. Therefore, to address this challenge, this paper constructs a deep learning model to study the technology of cortical surface image registration. The specific work is as follows: (1) An unsupervised cortical surface registration network based on a multi-scale cascaded structure is designed, and a convolution method based on spherical harmonic transformation is introduced to register cortical surface data. This solves the problem of scale-inflexibility of spherical feature transformation and optimizes the multi-scale registration process. (2)By integrating the attention mechanism, a graph-enhenced module is introduced into the registration network, using the graph attention module to help the network learn global features of cortical surface data, enhancing the learning ability of the network. The results show that the graph attention module effectively enhances the network's ability to extract global features, and its registration results have significant advantages over other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansoor Ali Teevno, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Sharib Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning (DL) for surgical scene segmentation have yielded promising results on single-center and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalize well to unseen distributions or modalities. Even though human experts can identify visual appearances, DL methods often fail to do so when data samples do not follow a similar distribution. Current literature addressing domain gaps in modality changes has focused primarily on natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to endoscopic data, as visual cues in such data are more limited compared to natural scenes. In this work, we exploit both style and content information in images by performing instance normalization and feature covariance mapping techniques to preserve robust and generalizable feature representations. Additionally, to avoid the risk of removing salient feature representations associated with objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature-learning ResNet backbone that retains useful task-relevant features. Our proposed method shows a 13.7% improvement over the baseline DeepLabv3+ and nearly an 8% improvement over recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for the target (different modality) set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset. Similarly, our method achieved a 19% improvement over the baseline and 6% over the best-performing SOTA method on the EndoUDA Barrett's esophagus (BE) dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Mahara, Md Rezaul Karim Khan, Naphtali D. Rishe, Wenjia Wang, Seyed Masoud Sadjadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Road Extraction is a sub-domain of Remote Sensing applications; it is a subject of extensive and ongoing research. The procedure of automatically extracting roads from satellite imagery encounters significant challenges due to the multi-scale and diverse structures of roads; improvement in this field is needed. The DeepLab series, known for its proficiency in semantic segmentation due to its efficiency in interpreting multi-scale objects' features, addresses some of these challenges caused by the varying nature of roads. The present work proposes the utilization of DeepLabV3+, the latest version of the DeepLab series, by introducing an innovative Dense Depthwise Dilated Separable Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DenseDDSSPP) module and integrating it in place of the conventional Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. This modification enhances the extraction of complex road structures from satellite images. This study hypothesizes that the integration of DenseDDSSPP, combined with an appropriately selected backbone network and a Squeeze-and-Excitation block, will generate an efficient dense feature map by focusing on relevant features, leading to more precise and accurate road extraction from Remote Sensing images. The results section presents a comparison of our model's performance against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating better results that highlight the effectiveness and success of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juraj Fulir, Natascha Jeziorski, Lovro Bosnar, Hans Hagen, Claudia Redenbach, Petra Gospodneti\'c, Tobias Herrfurth, Marcus Trost, Thomas Gischkat</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) methods for development of robust and flexible visual inspection system has shown promising. However their performance is highly dependent on the amount and diversity of training data. This is often restricted not only due to costs but also due to a wide variety of defects and product surfaces which occur with varying frequency. As such, one can not guarantee that the acquired dataset contains enough defect and product surface occurrences which are needed to develop a robust model. Using parametric synthetic dataset generation, it is possible to avoid these issues. In this work, we introduce a complete pipeline which describes in detail how to approach image synthesis for surface inspection - from first acquisition, to texture and defect modeling, data generation, comparison to real data and finally use of the synthetic data to train a defect segmentation model. The pipeline is in detail evaluated for milled and sandblasted aluminum surfaces. In addition to providing an in-depth view into each step, discussion of chosen methods, and presentation of ML results, we provide a comprehensive dual dataset containing both real and synthetic images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxiao Zhang, Bo Luo, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers have made remarkable progress in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most vision tasks. A key component of this success is due to the introduction of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) module, which enables each head to learn different representations by applying the attention mechanism independently. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that Vision Transformers can be further enhanced by overlapping the heads in MHSA. We introduce Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention (MOHSA), where heads are overlapped with their two adjacent heads for queries, keys, and values, while zero-padding is employed for the first and last heads, which have only one neighboring head. Various paradigms for overlapping ratios are proposed to fully investigate the optimal performance of our approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five Transformer models on four benchmark datasets and yields a significant performance boost. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, a body of works has emerged, studying shape and texture biases of off-the-shelf pre-trained deep neural networks (DNN) for image classification. These works study how much a trained DNN relies on image cues, predominantly shape and texture. In this work, we switch the perspective, posing the following questions: What can a DNN learn from each of the image cues, i.e., shape, texture and color, respectively? How much does each cue influence the learning success? And what are the synergy effects between different cues? Studying these questions sheds light upon cue influences on learning and thus the learning capabilities of DNNs. We study these questions on semantic segmentation which allows us to address our questions on pixel level. To conduct this study, we develop a generic procedure to decompose a given dataset into multiple ones, each of them only containing either a single cue or a chosen mixture. This framework is then applied to two real-world datasets, Cityscapes and PASCAL Context, and a synthetic data set based on the CARLA simulator. We learn the given semantic segmentation task from these cue datasets, creating cue experts. Early fusion of cues is performed by constructing appropriate datasets. This is complemented by a late fusion of experts which allows us to study cue influence location-dependent on pixel level. Our study on three datasets reveals that neither texture nor shape clearly dominate the learning success, however a combination of shape and color but without texture achieves surprisingly strong results. Our findings hold for convolutional and transformer backbones. In particular, qualitatively there is almost no difference in how both of the architecture types extract information from the different cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengze Ye, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Yipeng Sun, Mareike Thies, Siyuan Mei, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for reconstructing cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images for arbitrary orbits using a differentiable shift-variant filtered backprojection (FBP) neural network. Traditional CBCT reconstruction methods for arbitrary orbits, like iterative reconstruction algorithms, are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. The proposed method addresses these challenges by employing a shift-variant FBP algorithm optimized for arbitrary trajectories through a deep learning approach that adapts to a specific orbit geometry. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing techniques by integrating known operators into the learning model, minimizing the number of parameters, and improving the interpretability of the model. The proposed method is a significant advancement in interventional medical imaging, particularly for robotic C-arm CT systems, enabling faster and more accurate CBCT reconstructions with customized orbits. Especially this method can also be used for the analytical reconstruction of non-continuous orbits like circular plus arc. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly accelerates the reconstruction process compared to conventional iterative algorithms. It achieves comparable or superior image quality, as evidenced by metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The validation experiments show that the method can handle data from different trajectories, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness across different scan geometries. Our method demonstrates a significant improvement, particularly for the sinusoidal trajectory, achieving a 38.6% reduction in MSE, a 7.7% increase in PSNR, and a 5.0% improvement in SSIM. Furthermore, the computation time for reconstruction was reduced by more than 97%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Liang, Yijun Li, Yumeng Niu, Qianhe Shen, Hangyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP is critical for their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics, and security systems, where accurate interpretation of visual and textual data is essential. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can severely compromise their performance and reliability in real-world scenarios. Previous methods have primarily focused on improving robustness through adversarial training and generating adversarial examples using models like FGSM, AutoAttack, and DeepFool. However, these approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as fixed perturbation norms or predefined attack patterns, and involve high computational complexity, making them challenging to implement in practical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework that integrates multiple attack strategies and advanced machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the robustness of VLMs against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances model robustness. The fine-tuned CLIP model achieved an accuracy of 43.5% on adversarially perturbed images, compared to only 4% for the baseline model. The neural network model achieved a high accuracy of 98% in these challenging classification tasks, while the XGBoost model reached a success rate of 85.26% in prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Yi Gu, Zhendong Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, the ultimate performance of SiD is constrained by the accuracy with which the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when trained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method has set new benchmarks for generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achieving FID scores of $\mathbf{1.499}$ on CIFAR-10 unconditional, $\mathbf{1.396}$ on CIFAR-10 conditional, and $\mathbf{1.110}$ on ImageNet 64x64. Our open-source code will be integrated into the SiD codebase on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Chengxin Li, Shoukun Xu, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal fusion has played a vital role in multi-modal scene understanding. Most existing methods focus on cross-modal fusion involving two modalities, often overlooking more complex multi-modal fusion, which is essential for real-world applications like autonomous driving, where visible, depth, event, LiDAR, etc., are used. Besides, few attempts for multi-modal fusion, \emph{e.g.}, simple concatenation, cross-modal attention, and token selection, cannot well dig into the intrinsic shared and specific details of multiple modalities. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we propose a Part-Whole Relational Fusion (PWRF) framework. For the first time, this framework treats multi-modal fusion as part-whole relational fusion. It routes multiple individual part-level modalities to a fused whole-level modality using the part-whole relational routing ability of Capsule Networks (CapsNets). Through this part-whole routing, our PWRF generates modal-shared and modal-specific semantics from the whole-level modal capsules and the routing coefficients, respectively. On top of that, modal-shared and modal-specific details can be employed to solve the issue of multi-modal scene understanding, including synthetic multi-modal segmentation and visible-depth-thermal salient object detection in this paper. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PWRF framework for multi-modal scene understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Roald, Magnus Breder Birkenes, Lars Gunnars{\o}nn Bag{\o}ien Johnsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital tools for text analysis have long been essential for the searchability and accessibility of digitised library collections. Recent computer vision advances have introduced similar capabilities for visual materials, with deep learning-based embeddings showing promise for analysing visual heritage. Given that many books feature visuals in addition to text, taking advantage of these breakthroughs is critical to making library collections open and accessible. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept image search application for exploring images in the National Library of Norway's pre-1900 books, comparing Vision Transformer (ViT), Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), and Sigmoid loss for Language-Image Pre-training (SigLIP) embeddings for image retrieval and classification. Our results show that the application performs well for exact image retrieval, with SigLIP embeddings slightly outperforming CLIP and ViT in both retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally, SigLIP-based image classification can aid in cleaning image datasets from a digitisation pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seulbi Lee, Jihyo Kim, Sangheum Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent emergence of foundation models trained on internet-scale data and demonstrating remarkable generalization capabilities, such foundation models have become more widely adopted, leading to an expanding range of application domains. Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Based on our observations, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed \emph{Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide)}, aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linh Van Ma, Muhammad Ishfaq Hussain, Kin-Choong Yow, Moongu Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: The MS-GLMB filter offers a robust framework for tracking multiple objects through the use of multi-sensor data. Building on this, the MV-GLMB and MV-GLMB-AB filters enhance the MS-GLMB capabilities by employing cameras for 3D multi-sensor multi-object tracking, effectively addressing occlusions. However, both filters depend on overlapping fields of view from the cameras to combine complementary information. In this paper, we introduce an improved approach that integrates an additional sensor, such as LiDAR, into the MS-GLMB framework for 3D multi-object tracking. Specifically, we present a new LiDAR measurement model, along with a multi-camera and LiDAR multi-object measurement model. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in tracking performance compared to existing MS-GLMB-based methods. Importantly, our method eliminates the need for overlapping fields of view, broadening the applicability of the MS-GLMB filter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Wang, Zhiqiang Yan, Junkai Fan, Wanlu Zhu, Xiang Li, Jun Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DCDepth, a novel framework for the long-standing monocular depth estimation task. Moving beyond conventional pixel-wise depth estimation in the spatial domain, our approach estimates the frequency coefficients of depth patches after transforming them into the discrete cosine domain. This unique formulation allows for the modeling of local depth correlations within each patch. Crucially, the frequency transformation segregates the depth information into various frequency components, with low-frequency components encapsulating the core scene structure and high-frequency components detailing the finer aspects. This decomposition forms the basis of our progressive strategy, which begins with the prediction of low-frequency components to establish a global scene context, followed by successive refinement of local details through the prediction of higher-frequency components. We conduct comprehensive experiments on NYU-Depth-V2, TOFDC, and KITTI datasets, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DCDepth.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huyen Le, Khiet Dang, Nhung Nguyen, Mai Tran, Hieu Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a powerful tool in advancing cardiovascular research and clinical applications. The maturation of sarcomere organization in hiPSC-CMs is crucial, as it supports the contractile function and structural integrity of these cells. Traditional methods for assessing this maturation like manual annotation and feature extraction are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. To address this, we propose D-SarcNet, a dual-stream deep learning framework that takes fluorescent hiPSC-CM single-cell images as input and outputs the stage of the sarcomere structural organization on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0. The framework also integrates Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), deep learning-generated local patterns, and gradient magnitude to capture detailed structural information at both global and local levels. Experiments on a publicly available dataset from the Allen Institute for Cell Science show that the proposed approach not only achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.868 marking a 3.7% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art but also significantly enhances other key performance metrics, including MSE, MAE, and R2 score. Beyond establishing a new state-of-the-art in sarcomere structure assessment from hiPSC-CM images, our ablation studies highlight the significance of integrating global and local information to enhance deep learning networks ability to discern and learn vital visual features of sarcomere structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhewei Dai, Shilei Zeng, Haotian Liu, Xurui Li, Feng Xue, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Current segmentation methods require many training images and precise masks, while insufficient anomaly images hinder their application in industrial scenarios. To address such an issue, we explore producing diverse anomalies and accurate pixel-wise annotations. By observing the real production lines, we find that anomalies vary randomly in shape and appearance, whereas products hold globally consistent patterns with slight local variations. Such a characteristic inspires us to develop a Separation and Sharing Fine-tuning (SeaS) approach using only a few abnormal and some normal images. Firstly, we propose the Unbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt tailored to industrial anomaly generation, consisting of one product token and several anomaly tokens. Then, for anomaly images, we propose a Decoupled Anomaly Alignment (DA) loss to bind the attributes of the anomalies to different anomaly tokens. Re-blending such attributes may produce never-seen anomalies, achieving a high diversity of anomalies. For normal images, we propose a Normal-image Alignment (NA) loss to learn the products' key features that are used to synthesize products with both global consistency and local variations. The two training processes are separated but conducted on a shared U-Net. Finally, SeaS produces high-fidelity annotations for the generated anomalies by fusing discriminative features of U-Net and high-resolution VAE features. Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec AD and MVTec 3D AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For anomaly image generation, we achieve 1.88 on IS and 0.34 on IC-LPIPS on MVTec AD dataset, 1.95 on IS and 0.30 on IC-LPIPS on MVTec 3D AD dataset. For downstream task, using our generated anomaly image-mask pairs, three common segmentation methods achieve an average 11.17% improvement on IoU on MVTec AD dataset, and a 15.49% enhancement in IoU on MVTec 3D AD dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answer (VQA) poses the problem of answering a natural language question about a visual context. Bangla, despite being a widely spoken language, is considered low-resource in the realm of VQA due to the lack of a proper benchmark dataset. The absence of such datasets challenges models that are known to be performant in other languages. Furthermore, existing Bangla VQA datasets offer little cultural relevance and are largely adapted from their foreign counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale Bangla VQA dataset titled ChitroJera, totaling over 15k samples where diverse and locally relevant data sources are used. We assess the performance of text encoders, image encoders, multimodal models, and our novel dual-encoder models. The experiments reveal that the pre-trained dual-encoders outperform other models of its scale. We also evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) using prompt-based techniques, with LLMs achieving the best performance. Given the underdeveloped state of existing datasets, we envision ChitroJera expanding the scope of Vision-Language tasks in Bangla.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video understanding has become increasingly important with the rise of multi-modality applications. Understanding continuous video poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed events. We introduce a novel system, C-VUE, to overcome these issues through adaptive state modeling. C-VUE has three key designs. The first is a long-range history modeling technique that uses a video-aware approach to retain historical video information. The second is a spatial redundancy reduction technique, which enhances the efficiency of history modeling based on temporal relations. The third is a parallel training structure that incorporates the frame-weighted loss to understand multi-scale events in long videos. Our C-VUE offers high accuracy and efficiency. It runs at speeds >30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines in accuracy. Moreover, applying C-VUE to a video foundation model as a video encoder in our case study resulted in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models are trained using large datasets collected by scraping image-text pairs from the internet. These datasets often include private, copyrighted, and licensed material. Training models on such datasets enables them to generate images with such content, which might violate copyright laws and individual privacy. This phenomenon is termed imitation -- generation of images with content that has recognizable similarity to its training images. In this work we study the relationship between a concept's frequency in the training dataset and the ability of a model to imitate it. We seek to determine the point at which a model was trained on enough instances to imitate a concept -- the imitation threshold. We posit this question as a new problem: Finding the Imitation Threshold (FIT) and propose an efficient approach that estimates the imitation threshold without incurring the colossal cost of training multiple models from scratch. We experiment with two domains -- human faces and art styles -- for which we create four datasets, and evaluate three text-to-image models which were trained on two pretraining datasets. Our results reveal that the imitation threshold of these models is in the range of 200-600 images, depending on the domain and the model. The imitation threshold can provide an empirical basis for copyright violation claims and acts as a guiding principle for text-to-image model developers that aim to comply with copyright and privacy laws.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Hu, Chenyi Zhuang, Pan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Style transfer aims to fuse the artistic representation of a style image with the structural information of a content image. Existing methods train specific networks or utilize pre-trained models to learn content and style features. However, they rely solely on textual or spatial representations that are inadequate to achieve the balance between content and style. In this work, we propose a novel and training-free approach for style transfer, combining textual embedding with spatial features and separating the injection of content or style. Specifically, we adopt the BLIP-2 encoder to extract the textual representation of the style image. We utilize the DDIM inversion technique to extract intermediate embeddings in content and style branches as spatial features. Finally, we harness the step-by-step property of diffusion models by separating the injection of content and style in the target branch, which improves the balance between content preservation and style fusion. Various experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed DiffeseST for achieving balanced and controllable style transfer results, as well as the potential to extend to other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhan, Zhihong Zeng, Haijun Liu, Xiaoheng Tan, Yinli Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of RGB-D Salient Object Detection (SOD) is to pinpoint the most visually conspicuous areas within images accurately. While conventional deep models heavily rely on CNN extractors and overlook the long-range contextual dependencies, subsequent transformer-based models have addressed the issue to some extent but introduce high computational complexity. Moreover, incorporating spatial information from depth maps has been proven effective for this task. A primary challenge of this issue is how to fuse the complementary information from RGB and depth effectively. In this paper, we propose a dual Mamba-driven cross-modal fusion network for RGB-D SOD, named MambaSOD. Specifically, we first employ a dual Mamba-driven feature extractor for both RGB and depth to model the long-range dependencies in multiple modality inputs with linear complexity. Then, we design a cross-modal fusion Mamba for the captured multi-modal features to fully utilize the complementary information between the RGB and depth features. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to explore the potential of the Mamba in the RGB-D SOD task, offering a novel perspective. Numerous experiments conducted on six prevailing datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over sixteen state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD models.

In this approach, a set of related images is generated simultaneously, optionally conditioned on a subset of the group. GDTs build upon diffusion transformers with minimal architectural modifications by concatenating self-attention tokens across images. This allows the model to implicitly capture cross-image relationships (e.g., identities, styles, layouts, surroundings, and color schemes) through caption-based correlations. Our design enables scalable, unsupervised, and task-agnostic pretraining using extensive collections of image groups sourced from multimodal internet articles, image galleries, and video frames. We evaluate GDTs on a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 200 instructions across 30 distinct visual generation tasks, including picture book creation, font design, style transfer, sketching, colorization, drawing sequence generation, and character customization. Our models achieve competitive zero-shot performance without any additional fine-tuning or gradient updates. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of key components such as data scaling, group size, and model design. These results demonstrate the potential of GDTs as scalable, general-purpose visual generation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diagnosing and treating skin diseases require advanced visual skills across multiple domains and the ability to synthesize information from various imaging modalities. Current deep learning models, while effective at specific tasks such as diagnosing skin cancer from dermoscopic images, fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal demands of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on a dataset of over 2 million real-world images of skin diseases, sourced from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse datasets covering a range of clinical tasks, including skin cancer screening, phenotype assessment and risk stratification, diagnosis of neoplastic and inflammatory skin diseases, skin lesion segmentation, change monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models even when using only 5-10% of labeled data. PanDerm's clinical utility was demonstrated through reader studies in real-world clinical settings across multiple imaging modalities. It outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection accuracy and enhanced clinicians' multiclass skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% in a collaborative human-AI setting. Additionally, PanDerm demonstrated robust performance across diverse demographic factors, including different body locations, age groups, genders, and skin tones. The strong results in benchmark evaluations and real-world clinical scenarios suggest that PanDerm could enhance the management of skin diseases and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ra\'ul Iranzo, V\'ictor M. Batlle, Juan D. Tard\'os, Jos\'e M. M. Montiel</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric reconstruction and SLAM with endoscopic images have seen significant advancements in recent years. In most medical specialties, the endoscopes used are monocular, and the algorithms applied are typically extensions of those designed for external environments, resulting in 3D reconstructions up to an unknown scale factor.
  In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that standard endoscopes are equipped with near-light sources positioned at a small but non-zero baseline from the camera. By leveraging the inverse-square law of light decay, we enable, for the first time, monocular reconstructions with accurate metric scale. This paves the way to transform any endoscope into a metric device, which is essential for practical applications such as measuring polyps, stenosis, or the extent of tissue affected by disease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hrishav Bakul Barua, Stefanov Kalin, Lemuel Lai En Che, Dhall Abhinav, Wong KokSheik, Krishnasamy Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is an important computer vision problem. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task where the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., LDR to HDR. To address limitations of current methods, such as the paired data constraint , as well as unwanted blurring and visual artifacts in the reconstructed HDR, we propose a method that uses a modified cycle-consistent adversarial architecture and utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. The method achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Guo, Wenhao Chai, Shi-Yan Li, Gaoang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) has recently garnered attention as a prominent research focus. By harnessing powerful LLM, it facilitates a transition of conversational generative AI from unimodal text to performing multimodal tasks. This boom begins to significantly impact medical field. However, general visual language model (VLM) lacks sophisticated comprehension for medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). Even models specifically tailored for medical domain tend to produce vague answers with weak visual relevance. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained adaptive VLM architecture for Chinese medical visual conversations through parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, we devise a fusion module with fine-grained vision encoders to achieve enhancement for subtle medical visual semantics. Then we note data redundancy common to medical scenes is ignored in most prior works. In cases of a single text paired with multiple figures, we utilize weighted scoring with knowledge distillation to adaptively screen valid images mirroring text descriptions. For execution, we leverage a large-scale multimodal Chinese ultrasound dataset obtained from the hospital. We create instruction-following data based on text from professional doctors, which ensures effective tuning. With enhanced model and quality data, our Large Chinese Language and Vision Assistant for Ultrasound (LLaVA-Ultra) shows strong capability and robustness to medical scenarios. On three Med-VQA datasets, LLaVA-Ultra surpasses previous state-of-the-art models on various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Hsiu Huang, Ja-Ling Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The digital image manipulation and advancements in Generative AI, such as Deepfake, has raised significant concerns regarding the authenticity of images shared on social media. Traditional image forensic techniques, while helpful, are often passive and insufficient against sophisticated tampering methods. This paper introduces the Secure Learned Image Codec (SLIC), a novel active approach to ensuring image authenticity through watermark embedding in the compressed domain. SLIC leverages neural network-based compression to embed watermarks as adversarial perturbations in the latent space, creating images that degrade in quality upon re-compression if tampered with. This degradation acts as a defense mechanism against unauthorized modifications. Our method involves fine-tuning a neural encoder/decoder to balance watermark invisibility with robustness, ensuring minimal quality loss for non-watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate SLIC's effectiveness in generating visible artifacts in tampered images, thereby preventing their redistribution. This work represents a significant step toward developing secure image codecs that can be widely adopted to safeguard digital image integrity.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15091">Spatial-Mamba: Effective Visual State Space Models via Structure-Aware State Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaodong Xiao, Minghan Li, Zhengqiang Zhang, Deyu Meng, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, highly excel at capturing long-range dependencies in 1D sequential data, while their applications to 2D vision tasks still face challenges. Current visual SSMs often convert images into 1D sequences and employ various scanning patterns to incorporate local spatial dependencies. However, these methods are limited in effectively capturing the complex image spatial structures and the increased computational cost caused by the lengthened scanning paths. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial-Mamba, a novel approach that establishes neighborhood connectivity directly in the state space. Instead of relying solely on sequential state transitions, we introduce a structure-aware state fusion equation, which leverages dilated convolutions to capture image spatial structural dependencies, significantly enhancing the flow of visual contextual information. Spatial-Mamba proceeds in three stages: initial state computation in a unidirectional scan, spatial context acquisition through structure-aware state fusion, and final state computation using the observation equation. Our theoretical analysis shows that Spatial-Mamba unifies the original Mamba and linear attention under the same matrix multiplication framework, providing a deeper understanding of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial-Mamba, even with a single scan, attains or surpasses the state-of-the-art SSM-based models in image classification, detection and segmentation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15094">CosFairNet:A Parameter-Space based Approach for Bias Free Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi, Priyadarshini Kumari, Vinod K Kurmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks trained on biased data often inadvertently learn unintended inference rules, particularly when labels are strongly correlated with biased features. Existing bias mitigation methods typically involve either a) predefining bias types and enforcing them as prior knowledge or b) reweighting training samples to emphasize bias-conflicting samples over bias-aligned samples. However, both strategies address bias indirectly in the feature or sample space, with no control over learned weights, making it difficult to control the bias propagation across different layers. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel approach to address bias directly in the model's parameter space, preventing its propagation across layers. Our method involves training two models: a bias model for biased features and a debias model for unbiased details, guided by the bias model. We enforce dissimilarity in the debias model's later layers and similarity in its initial layers with the bias model, ensuring it learns unbiased low-level features without adopting biased high-level abstractions. By incorporating this explicit constraint during training, our approach shows enhanced classification accuracy and debiasing effectiveness across various synthetic and real-world datasets of different sizes. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness across different bias types and percentages of biased samples in the training data.

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) approach using Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI), where a series of compact spatial and temporal representations of a face video signal (i.e., 2D/3D key-points, facial semantics and compact features) can be coded using SEI message and inserted into the coded video bitstream. At the time of writing, the proposed GFVC approach is an official "technology under consideration" (TuC) for standardization by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ISO/IEC JVT 1/SC 29 and ITU-T SG16. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the JVET work on the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach is the first standardization activity for generative video compression. The proposed SEI approach has not only advanced the reconstruction quality of early-day Model-Based Coding (MBC) via the state-of-the-art generative technique, but also established a new SEI definition for future GFVC applications and deployment. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach can achieve remarkable rate-distortion performance compared with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, whilst also potentially enabling a wide variety of functionalities including user-specified animation/filtering and metaverse-related applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a zero-shot text-driven 3D shape deformation system that deforms an input 3D mesh of a manufactured object to fit an input text description. To do this, our system optimizes the parameters of a deformation model to maximize an objective function based on the widely used pre-trained vision language model CLIP. We find that CLIP-based objective functions exhibit many spurious local optima; to circumvent them, we parameterize deformations using a novel deformation model called BoxDefGraph which our system automatically computes from an input mesh, the BoxDefGraph is designed to capture the object aligned rectangular/circular geometry features of most manufactured objects. We then use the CMA-ES global optimization algorithm to maximize our objective, which we find to work better than popular gradient-based optimizers. We demonstrate that our approach produces appealing results and outperforms several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wassim Jabbour, Enzo Benoit-Jeannin, Oscar Bedford, Saif Shahin</p>
<p>Abstract: Chess involves extensive study and requires players to keep manual records of their matches, a process which is time-consuming and distracting. The lack of high-quality labeled photographs of chess boards, and the tediousness of manual labeling, have hindered the wide application of Deep Learning (DL) to automating this record-keeping process. This paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline that employs domain adaptation (DA) to predict the labels of real, top-view, unlabeled chessboard images using synthetic, labeled images. The pipeline is composed of a pre-processing phase which detects the board, crops the individual squares, and feeds them one at a time to a DL model. The model then predicts the labels of the squares and passes the ordered predictions to a post-processing pipeline which generates the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of the position. The three approaches considered are the following: A VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet, defined here as the Base-Source model, fine-tuned to predict source domain squares and then used to predict target domain squares without any domain adaptation; an improved version of the Base-Source model which applied CORAL loss to some of the final fully connected layers of the VGG16 to implement DA; and a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) which used the adversarial training of a domain discriminator to perform the DA. Also, although we opted not to use the labels of the target domain for this study, we trained a baseline with the same architecture as the Base-Source model (Named Base-Target) directly on the target domain in order to get an upper bound on the performance achievable through domain adaptation. The results show that the DANN model only results in a 3% loss in accuracy when compared to the Base-Target model while saving all the effort required to label the data.</p>

To address this, hyperspectral data from specialized cameras can be very useful in addition to RGB images.

To overcome these difficulties, we propose an innovative Siamese framework that uses time series-based compression to effectively and scalably integrate the additional spectral data into the segmentation task. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness through competitive benchmarks on aerial datasets in various environmental conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distinguishing between swarming and swimming, the two principal forms of bacterial movement, holds significant conceptual and clinical relevance. This is because bacteria that exhibit swarming capabilities often possess unique properties crucial to the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and may also have therapeutic potential. Here, we report a deep learning-based swarming classifier that rapidly and autonomously predicts swarming probability using a single blurry image. Compared with traditional video-based, manually-processed approaches, our method is particularly suited for high-throughput environments and provides objective, quantitative assessments of swarming probability. The swarming classifier demonstrated in our work was trained on Enterobacter sp. SM3 and showed good performance when blindly tested on new swarming (positive) and swimming (negative) test images of SM3, achieving a sensitivity of 97.44% and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, this classifier demonstrated robust external generalization capabilities when applied to unseen bacterial species, such as Serratia marcescens DB10 and Citrobacter koseri H6. It blindly achieved a sensitivity of 97.92% and a specificity of 96.77% for DB10, and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.22% for H6. This competitive performance indicates the potential to adapt our approach for diagnostic applications through portable devices or even smartphones. This adaptation would facilitate rapid, objective, on-site screening for bacterial swarming motility, potentially enhancing the early detection and treatment assessment of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and urinary tract infections (UTI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Bagheri, Yalda Mohsenzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Image memorability refers to the phenomenon where certain images are more likely to be remembered than others. It is a quantifiable and intrinsic image attribute, defined as the likelihood of being remembered upon a single exposure. Despite advances in understanding human visual perception and memory, it is unclear what features contribute to an image's memorability. To address this question, we propose a deep learning-based computational modeling approach.
  Methods: We modeled the subjective experience of visual memorability using an autoencoder based on VGG16 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was trained on images for one epoch, to simulate the single-exposure condition used in human memory tests. We investigated the relationship between memorability and reconstruction error, assessed latent space representations distinctiveness, and developed a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict memorability likelihood. Interpretability analysis was conducted to identify key image characteristics contributing to memorability.
  Results: Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between the images memorability score and autoencoder's reconstruction error, and the robust predictive performance of its latent representations. Distinctiveness in these representations correlated significantly with memorability. Additionally, certain visual characteristics, such as strong contrasts, distinctive objects, and prominent foreground elements were among the features contributing to image memorability in our model.
  Conclusions: Images with unique features that challenge the autoencoder's capacity are inherently more memorable. Moreover, these memorable images are distinct from others the model has encountered, and the latent space of the encoder contains features predictive of memorability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiwen Diao, Ying Zhang, Shang Gao, Jiawen Zhu, Long Chen, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal metric learning is a prominent research topic that bridges the semantic heterogeneity between vision and language. Existing methods frequently utilize simple cosine or complex distance metrics to transform the pairwise features into a similarity score, which suffers from an inadequate or inefficient capability for distance measurements. Consequently, we propose a Generalized Structural Sparse Function to dynamically capture thorough and powerful relationships across modalities for pair-wise similarity learning while remaining concise but efficient. Specifically, the distance metric delicately encapsulates two formats of diagonal and block-diagonal terms, automatically distinguishing and highlighting the cross-channel relevancy and dependency inside a structured and organized topology. Hence, it thereby empowers itself to adapt to the optimal matching patterns between the paired features and reaches a sweet spot between model complexity and capability. Extensive experiments on cross-modal and two extra uni-modal retrieval tasks (image-text retrieval, person re-identification, fine-grained image retrieval) have validated its superiority and flexibility over various popular retrieval frameworks. More importantly, we further discover that it can be seamlessly incorporated into multiple application scenarios, and demonstrates promising prospects from Attention Mechanism to Knowledge Distillation in a plug-and-play manner.

Video description serves as a fundamental task for evaluating video comprehension, necessitating a deep understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics, which presents challenges for both humans and machines. Thus, investigating whether LVLMs can describe videos as comprehensively as humans (through reasonable human-machine comparisons using video captioning as a proxy task) will enhance our understanding and application of these models. However, current benchmarks for video comprehension have notable limitations, including short video durations, brief annotations, and reliance on a single annotator's perspective. These factors hinder a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' ability to understand complex, lengthy videos and prevent the establishment of a robust human baseline that accurately reflects human video comprehension capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a novel benchmark, FIOVA (Five In One Video Annotations), designed to evaluate the differences between LVLMs and human understanding more comprehensively. FIOVA includes 3,002 long video sequences (averaging 33.6 seconds) that cover diverse scenarios with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Each video is annotated by five distinct annotators, capturing a wide range of perspectives and resulting in captions that are 4-15 times longer than existing benchmarks, thereby establishing a robust baseline that represents human understanding comprehensively for the first time in video description tasks. Using the FIOVA benchmark, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of six state-of-the-art LVLMs, comparing their performance with humans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Wang, Yun Xiao, Xiaopeng Peng, Xiaojun Chang, Xuanhong Wang, Dingyi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal action detection (TAD), which locates and recognizes action segments, remains a challenging task in video understanding due to variable segment lengths and ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods treat neighboring contexts of an action segment indiscriminately, leading to imprecise boundary predictions. We introduce a single-stage ContextDet framework, which makes use of large-kernel convolutions in TAD for the first time. Our model features a pyramid adaptive context aggragation (ACA) architecture, capturing long context and improving action discriminability. Each ACA level consists of two novel modules. The context attention module (CAM) identifies salient contextual information, encourages context diversity, and preserves context integrity through a context gating block (CGB). The long context module (LCM) makes use of a mixture of large- and small-kernel convolutions to adaptively gather long-range context and fine-grained local features. Additionally, by varying the length of these large kernels across the ACA pyramid, our model provides lightweight yet effective context aggregation and action discrimination. We conducted extensive experiments and compared our model with a number of advanced TAD methods on six challenging TAD benchmarks: MultiThumos, Charades, FineAction, EPIC-Kitchens 100, Thumos14, and HACS, demonstrating superior accuracy at reduced inference speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhao, Hao Fei, Xiangtai Li, Libo Qin, Jiayi Ji, Hongyuan Zhu, Meishan Zhang, Min Zhang, Jianguo Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Hosoya, Masanori Suganuma, Takayuki Okatani</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), detecting specific classes of objects using only their linguistic descriptions (e.g., class names) without any image samples, has garnered significant attention. However, in real-world applications, the target class concepts is often hard to describe in text and the only way to specify target objects is to provide their image examples, yet it is often challenging to obtain a good number of samples. Thus, there is a high demand from practitioners for few-shot object detection (FSOD). A natural question arises: Can the benefits of OVD extend to FSOD for object classes that are difficult to describe in text? Compared to traditional methods that learn only predefined classes (referred to in this paper as closed-set object detection, COD), can the extra cost of OVD be justified? To answer these questions, we propose a method to quantify the ``text-describability'' of object detection datasets using the zero-shot image classification accuracy with CLIP. This allows us to categorize various OD datasets with different text-describability and emprically evaluate the FSOD performance of OVD and COD methods within each category. Our findings reveal that: i) there is little difference between OVD and COD for object classes with low text-describability under equal conditions in OD pretraining; and ii) although OVD can learn from more diverse data than OD-specific data, thereby increasing the volume of training data, it can be counterproductive for classes with low-text-describability. These findings provide practitioners with valuable guidance amidst the recent advancements of OVD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songtao Jiang, Yan Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Yeying Jin, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective for aligning large language models (LLMs), but when applied to multimodal models (MLLMs), it often favors text over image information, leading to unreliable outputs and visual hallucinations. To address this, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO) to balance text and image preferences. First, we found that the lack of image-related rewards in preference data biases optimization toward text, so we created automated, fine-grained image preference data to correct this. Then, we designed a learning objective to ensure the model captures both text and image preferences while maintaining high-quality outputs. Finally, we use a multi-stage alignment approach to stabilize training and improve learning across both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances MLLM trustworthiness. On models like LLaVA-v1.5 (7B, 13B), our approach reduces hallucinations substantially. On the 7B model, MFPO outperforms GPT-4V and achieves a nearly 40\% improvement over previous methods on Object HalBench, as well as achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Object HalBench and AMBER when combined with the latest LLaVA-v1.6. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Tang Tsui, Chien-Yao Wang, Hong-Yuan Mark Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying and localizing objects within images is a fundamental challenge, and numerous efforts have been made to enhance model accuracy by experimenting with diverse architectures and refining training strategies. Nevertheless, a prevalent limitation in existing models is overemphasizing the current input while ignoring the information from the entire dataset. We introduce an innovative {\em \textbf{R}etriever}-{\em\textbf{D}ictionary} (RD) module to address this issue. This architecture enables YOLO-based models to efficiently retrieve features from a Dictionary that contains the insight of the dataset, which is built by the knowledge from Visual Models (VM), Large Language Models (LLM), or Visual Language Models (VLM). The flexible RD enables the model to incorporate such explicit knowledge that enhances the ability to benefit multiple tasks, specifically, segmentation, detection, and classification, from pixel to image level. The experiments show that using the RD significantly improves model performance, achieving more than a 3\% increase in mean Average Precision for object detection with less than a 1\% increase in model parameters. Beyond 1-stage object detection models, the RD module improves the effectiveness of 2-stage models and DETR-based architectures, such as Faster R-CNN and Deformable DETR</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15364">Scene Graph Generation with Role-Playing Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guikun Chen, Jin Li, Wenguan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current approaches for open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) use vision-language models such as CLIP and follow a standard zero-shot pipeline -- computing similarity between the query image and the text embeddings for each category (i.e., text classifiers). In this work, we argue that the text classifiers adopted by existing OVSGG methods, i.e., category-/part-level prompts, are scene-agnostic as they remain unchanged across contexts. Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term "specific" means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter. It refines CLIP's ability to recognize relations by learning an interaction-aware semantic space. Extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks show that SDSGG outperforms top-leading methods by a clear margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Wang, Zehua Chen, Xiaoyu Chen, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-video (I2V) generation is gaining increasing attention with its wide application in video synthesis. Recently, diffusion-based I2V models have achieved remarkable progress given their novel design on network architecture, cascaded framework, and motion representation. However, restricted by their noise-to-data generation process, diffusion-based methods inevitably suffer the difficulty to generate video samples with both appearance consistency and temporal coherence from an uninformative Gaussian noise, which may limit their synthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge, taking the given static image as the prior of video target and establishing a tractable bridge model between them. By formulating I2V synthesis as a frames-to-frames generation task and modelling it with a data-to-data process, we fully exploit the information in input image and facilitate the generative model to learn the image animation process. In two popular settings of training I2V models, namely fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) model or training from scratch, we further propose two techniques, SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF) and neural prior, which improve the fine-tuning efficiency of diffusion-based T2V models to FrameBridge and the synthesis quality of bridge-based I2V models respectively. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate that: (1) our FrameBridge achieves superior I2V quality in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 83 vs. 176 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101); (2) our proposed SAF and neural prior effectively enhance the ability of bridge-based I2V models in the scenarios of fine-tuning and training from scratch.

<p>Abstract: 3D-shape reconstruction in extreme environments, such as low illumination or scattering condition, has been an open problem and intensively researched. Active stereo is one of potential solution for such environments for its robustness and high accuracy. However, active stereo systems usually consist of specialized system configurations with complicated algorithms, which narrow their application. In this paper, we propose Neural Signed Distance Field for active stereo systems to enable implicit correspondence search and triangulation in generalized Structured Light. With our technique, textureless or equivalent surfaces by low light condition are successfully reconstructed even with a small number of captured images. Experiments were conducted to confirm that the proposed method could achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality under such severe condition. We also demonstrated that the proposed method worked in an underwater scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuto Ichimaru, Diego Thomas, Takafumi Iwaguchi, Hiroshi Kawasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Active 3D measurement, especially structured light (SL) has been widely used in various fields for its robustness against textureless or equivalent surfaces by low light illumination. In addition, reconstruction of large scenes by moving the SL system has become popular, however, there have been few practical techniques to obtain the system's precise pose information only from images, since most conventional techniques are based on image features, which cannot be retrieved under textureless environments. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous shape reconstruction and pose estimation technique for SL systems from an image set where sparsely projected patterns onto the scene are observed (i.e. no scene texture information), which we call Active SfM. To achieve this, we propose a full optimization framework of the volumetric shape that employs neural signed distance fields (Neural-SDF) for SL with the goal of not only reconstructing the scene shape but also estimating the poses for each motion of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve accurate shape reconstruction as well as pose estimation from images where only projected patterns are observed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Ai, Huaibo Huang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based all-in-one image restoration (IR) frameworks have achieved remarkable performance by incorporating degradation-specific information into prompt modules. Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 image restoration tasks and 29 benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: We present Layout-Your-3D, a framework that allows controllable and compositional 3D generation from text prompts. Existing text-to-3D methods often struggle to generate assets with plausible object interactions or require tedious optimization processes. To address these challenges, our approach leverages 2D layouts as a blueprint to facilitate precise and plausible control over 3D generation. Starting with a 2D layout provided by a user or generated from a text description, we first create a coarse 3D scene using a carefully designed initialization process based on efficient reconstruction models. To enforce coherent global 3D layouts and enhance the quality of instance appearances, we propose a collision-aware layout optimization process followed by instance-wise refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that Layout-Your-3D yields more reasonable and visually appealing compositional 3D assets while significantly reducing the time required for each prompt. Additionally, Layout-Your-3D can be easily applicable to downstream tasks, such as 3D editing and object insertion. Our project page is available at:https://colezwhy.github.io/layoutyour3d/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Liao, Wei Zhai, Zengyu Wan, Tianzhu Zhang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames.We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

<p>Abstract: We present MMCS, a system capable of recognizing medical images and patient facial details, and providing professional medical diagnoses. The system consists of two core components: The first component is the analysis of medical images and videos. We trained a specialized multimodal medical model capable of interpreting medical images and accurately analyzing patients' facial emotions and facial paralysis conditions. The model achieved an accuracy of 72.59% on the FER2013 facial emotion recognition dataset, with a 91.1% accuracy in recognizing the happy emotion. In facial paralysis recognition, the model reached an accuracy of 92%, which is 30% higher than that of GPT-4o. Based on this model, we developed a parser for analyzing facial movement videos of patients with facial paralysis, achieving precise grading of the paralysis severity. In tests on 30 videos of facial paralysis patients, the system demonstrated a grading accuracy of 83.3%.The second component is the generation of professional medical responses. We employed a large language model, integrated with a medical knowledge base, to generate professional diagnoses based on the analysis of medical images or videos. The core innovation lies in our development of a department-specific knowledge base routing management mechanism, in which the large language model categorizes data by medical departments and, during the retrieval process, determines the appropriate knowledge base to query. This significantly improves retrieval accuracy in the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) process. This mechanism led to an average increase of 4 percentage points in accuracy for various large language models on the MedQA dataset.Our code is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/renllll/MMCS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mogens Plessen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses two tasks: (i) fixed-size objects such as hay bales are to be identified in an aerial image for a given reference image of the object, and (ii) variable-size patches such as areas on fields requiring spot spraying or other handling are to be identified in an image for a given small-scale reference image. Both tasks are related. The second differs in that identified sub-images similar to the reference image are further clustered before patches contours are determined by solving a traveling salesman problem. Both tasks are complex in that the exact number of similar sub-images is not known a priori. The main discussion of this paper is presentation of an acceleration mechanism for sub-image search that is based on a transformation of an image to multivariate time series along the RGB-channels and subsequent segmentation to reduce the 2D search space in the image. Two variations of the acceleration mechanism are compared to exhaustive search on diverse synthetic and real-world images. Quantitatively, proposed method results in solve time reductions of up to 2 orders of magnitude, while qualitatively delivering comparative visual results. Proposed method is neural network-free and does not use any image pre-processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adaptation of pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP to various downstream tasks have raised great interest in recent researches. Previous works have proposed a variety of test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to achieve strong generalization without any knowledge of the target domain. However, existing training-required TTA approaches like TPT necessitate entropy minimization that involves large computational overhead, while training-free methods like TDA overlook the potential for information mining from the test samples themselves. In this paper, we break down the design of existing popular training-required and training-free TTA methods and bridge the gap between them within our framework. Specifically, we maintain a light-weight key-value memory for feature retrieval from instance-agnostic historical samples and instance-aware boosting samples. The historical samples are filtered from the testing data stream and serve to extract useful information from the target distribution, while the boosting samples are drawn from regional bootstrapping and capture the knowledge of the test sample itself. We theoretically justify the rationality behind our method and empirically verify its effectiveness on both the out-of-distribution and the cross-domain datasets, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved significant success in both the natural image and medical image domains, encompassing a wide range of applications. Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, and utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships as well as anatomical structures and region classes to control certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing lesion generation and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate segmentation of retinal vessels in fundus images is a great challenge in medical image segmentation tasks due to their highly complex structure from other organs.Currently, deep-learning based methods for retinal cessel segmentation achieved suboptimal outcoms,since vessels with indistinct features are prone to being overlooked in deeper layers of the network. Additionally, the abundance of redundant information in the background poses significant interference to feature extraction, thus increasing the segmentation difficulty. To address this issue, this paper proposes a feature-enhanced interaction network based on DPCN, named MDFI-Net.Specifically, we design a feature enhancement structure, the Deformable-convolutional Pulse Coupling Network (DPCN), to provide an enhanced feature iteration sequence to the segmentation network in a simple and efficient manner. Subsequently, these features will interact within the segmentation network.Extensive experiments were conducted on publicly available retinal vessel segmentation datasets to validate the effectiveness of our network structure. Experimental results of our algorithm show that the detection accuracy of the retinal blood vessel achieves 97.91%, 97.97% and 98.16% across all datasets. Finally, plentiful experimental results also prove that the proposed MDFI-Net achieves segmentation performance superior to state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongmei Wang, Junlin Hou, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model interpretability effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Chi, Hengyuan Zhang, Chun-Kai Fan, Xingqun Qi, Rongyu Zhang, Anthony Chen, Chi-min Chan, Wei Xue, Wenhan Luo, Shanghang Zhang, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: World models integrate raw data from various modalities, such as images and language to simulate comprehensive interactions in the world, thereby displaying crucial roles in fields like mixed reality and robotics. Yet, applying the world model for accurate video prediction is quite challenging due to the complex and dynamic intentions of the various scenes in practice. In this paper, inspired by the human rethinking process, we decompose the complex video prediction into four meta-tasks that enable the world model to handle this issue in a more fine-grained manner. Alongside these tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named Embodied Video Anticipation Benchmark (EVA-Bench) to provide a well-rounded evaluation. EVA-Bench focused on evaluating the video prediction ability of human and robot actions, presenting significant challenges for both the language model and the generation model. Targeting embodied video prediction, we propose the Embodied Video Anticipator (EVA), a unified framework aiming at video understanding and generation. EVA integrates a video generation model with a visual language model, effectively combining reasoning capabilities with high-quality generation. Moreover, to enhance the generalization of our framework, we tailor-designed a multi-stage pretraining paradigm that adaptatively ensembles LoRA to produce high-fidelity results. Extensive experiments on EVA-Bench highlight the potential of EVA to significantly improve performance in embodied scenes, paving the way for large-scale pre-trained models in real-world prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Xiong, Jing Wang, Hengjing Xiang, Jun Xue, Chen Xu, Zhouqiang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have highlighted significant advancements in multimodal fusion. Nevertheless, such methods often encounter challenges regarding the efficacy of feature extraction, data integrity, consistency of feature dimensions, and adaptability across various downstream tasks. This paper proposes a generalized multimodal fusion method (GMF) via the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation, which adeptly addresses the aforementioned issues. Theoretically, the optimization objective for traditional multimodal tasks is formulated and redefined by integrating information entropy and the flow of gradient backward step. Leveraging these theoretical insights, the PNP equation is applied to feature fusion, rethinking multimodal features through the framework of charged particles in physics and controlling their movement through dissociation, concentration, and reconstruction. Building on these theoretical foundations, GMF disassociated features which extracted by the unimodal feature extractor into modality-specific and modality-invariant subspaces, thereby reducing mutual information and subsequently lowering the entropy of downstream tasks. The identifiability of the feature's origin enables our approach to function independently as a frontend, seamlessly integrated with a simple concatenation backend, or serve as a prerequisite for other modules. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks show that the proposed GMF achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters and computational resources. Furthermore, by integrating GMF with advanced fusion methods, we surpass the SOTA results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqiang Zhang, Xianjia Yu, Ha Sier, Haizhou Zhang, Tomi Westerlund</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, are asynchronous sensors that detect changes in brightness, offering notable advantages in environments characterized by high-speed motion, low lighting, or wide dynamic range. These distinctive properties render event cameras particularly effective for sensor fusion in robotics and computer vision, especially in enhancing traditional visual or LiDAR-inertial odometry. Conventional frame-based cameras suffer from limitations such as motion blur and drift, which can be mitigated by the continuous, low-latency data provided by event cameras. Similarly, LiDAR-based odometry encounters challenges related to the loss of geometric information in environments such as corridors. To address these limitations, unlike the existing event camera-related surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in event-based sensor fusion for odometry applications particularly, investigating fusion strategies that incorporate frame-based cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and LiDAR. The survey critically assesses the contributions of these fusion methods to improving odometry performance in complex environments, while highlighting key applications, and discussing the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges. Additionally, it offers insights into potential future research directions to advance event-based sensor fusion for next-generation odometry applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Lumetti, Vittorio Pipoli, Kevin Marchesini, Elisa Ficarra, Costantino Grana, Federico Bolelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the field of 3D medical segmentation has been dominated by deep learning models employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures, each with their distinctive strengths and limitations. CNNs are constrained by a local receptive field, whereas transformers are hindered by their substantial memory requirements as well as they data hungriness, making them not ideal for processing 3D medical volumes at a fine-grained level. For these reasons, fully convolutional neural networks, as nnUNet, still dominate the scene when segmenting medical structures in 3D large medical volumes. Despite numerous advancements towards developing transformer variants with subquadratic time and memory complexity, these models still fall short in content-based reasoning. A recent breakthrough is Mamba, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on State Space Models (SSMs) outperforming Transformers in many long-context tasks (million-length sequences) on famous natural language processing and genomic benchmarks while keeping a linear complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thinh Phan, Isaac Phillips, Andrew Lockett, Michael T. Kidd, Ngan Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Object tracking, especially animal tracking, is one of the key topics that attract a lot of attention due to its benefits of animal behavior understanding and monitoring. Recent state-of-the-art tracking methods are founded on deep learning architectures for object detection, appearance feature extraction and track association. Despite the good tracking performance, these methods are trained and evaluated on common objects such as human and cars. To perform on the animal, there is a need to create large datasets of different types in multiple conditions. The dataset construction comprises of data collection and data annotation. In this work, we put more focus on the latter task. Particularly, we renovate the well-known tool, LabelMe, so as to assist common user with or without in-depth knowledge about computer science to annotate the data with less effort. The new tool named as TrackMe inherits the simplicity, high compatibility with varied systems, minimal hardware requirement and convenient feature utilization from the predecessor. TrackMe is an upgraded version with essential features for multiple object tracking annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> XiaoJun Tang, Jingru Wang, Zeyu Shangguan, Darun Tang, Yuyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Unified Object Detection (UOD) task aims to achieve object detection of all merged categories through training on multiple datasets, and is of great significance in comprehensive object detection scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of the cross datasets missing annotations issue, and propose an Online Pseudo-Label Unified Object Detection scheme. Our method uses a periodically updated teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabelled objects in each sub-dataset. This periodical update strategy could better ensure that the accuracy of the teacher model reaches the local maxima and maximized the quality of pseudo-labels. In addition, we survey the influence of overlapped region proposals on the accuracy of box regression. We propose a category specific box regression and a pseudo-label RPN head to improve the recall rate of the Region Proposal Network (PRN). Our experimental results on common used benchmarks (\eg COCO, Object365 and OpenImages) indicates that our online pseudo-label UOD method achieves higher accuracy than existing SOTA methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In clinical In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), identifying the most viable embryo for transfer is important to increasing the likelihood of a successful pregnancy. Traditionally, this process involves embryologists manually assessing embryos' static morphological features at specific intervals using light microscopy. This manual evaluation is not only time-intensive and costly, due to the need for expert analysis, but also inherently subjective, leading to variability in the selection process. To address these challenges, we develop a multimodal model that leverages both time-lapse video data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to predict embryo viability. One of the primary challenges of our research is to effectively combine time-lapse video and EHR data, owing to their inherent differences in modality. We comprehensively analyze our multimodal model with various modality inputs and integration approaches. Our approach will enable fast and automated embryo viability predictions in scale for clinical IVF.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15582">ARTS: Semi-Analytical Regressor using Disentangled Skeletal Representations for Human Mesh Recovery from Videos</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Tang, Hong Liu, Yingxuan You, Ti Wang, Wenhao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Although existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods have made significant progress, simultaneously estimating human pose and shape from low-resolution image features limits their performance. These image features lack sufficient spatial information about the human body and contain various noises (e.g., background, lighting, and clothing), which often results in inaccurate pose and inconsistent motion. Inspired by the rapid advance in human pose estimation, we discover that compared to image features, skeletons inherently contain accurate human pose and motion. Therefore, we propose a novel semiAnalytical Regressor using disenTangled Skeletal representations for human mesh recovery from videos, called ARTS. Specifically, a skeleton estimation and disentanglement module is proposed to estimate the 3D skeletons from a video and decouple them into disentangled skeletal representations (i.e., joint position, bone length, and human motion). Then, to fully utilize these representations, we introduce a semi-analytical regressor to estimate the parameters of the human mesh model. The regressor consists of three modules: Temporal Inverse Kinematics (TIK), Bone-guided Shape Fitting (BSF), and Motion-Centric Refinement (MCR). TIK utilizes joint position to estimate initial pose parameters and BSF leverages bone length to regress bone-aligned shape parameters. Finally, MCR combines human motion representation with image features to refine the initial human model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ARTS surpasses existing state-of-the-art video-based methods in both per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency on popular benchmarks: 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingrui Ji, Vijaya Sindhoori Kaza, Nishanth Artham, Tianyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL) is for optimizing the selection of unlabeled data for annotation (labeling), aiming to enhance model performance while minimizing labeling effort. The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangjian Ji, Donglin Cheng, Kai Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to some complex factors (e.g., occlusion, pose variation and diverse camera perspectives), extracting stronger feature representation in person re-identification remains a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a novel self-supervision and supervision combining transformer-based person re-identification framework, namely SSSC-TransReID. Different from the general transformer-based person re-identification models, we designed a self-supervised contrastive learning branch, which can enhance the feature representation for person re-identification without negative samples or additional pre-training. In order to train the contrastive learning branch, we also proposed a novel random rectangle mask strategy to simulate the occlusion in real scenes, so as to enhance the feature representation for occlusion. Finally, we utilized the joint-training loss function to integrate the advantages of supervised learning with ID tags and self-supervised contrastive learning without negative samples, which can reinforce the ability of our model to excavate stronger discriminative features, especially for occlusion. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show our proposed model obtains superior Re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art ReID methods by large margins on the mean average accuracy (mAP) and Rank-1 accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Daizong Liu, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging task of 3D visual grounding-locating a specific object in a 3D point cloud scene based on text descriptions. Existing methods fall into two categories: top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down methods rely on a pre-trained 3D detector to generate and select the best bounding box, resulting in time-consuming processes. Bottom-up methods directly regress object bounding boxes with coarse-grained features, producing worse results. To combine their strengths while addressing their limitations, we propose a joint top-down and bottom-up framework, aiming to enhance the performance while improving the efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a bottom-up based proposal generation module, which utilizes lightweight neural layers to efficiently regress and cluster several coarse object proposals instead of using a complex 3D detector. Then, in the second stage, we introduce a top-down based proposal consolidation module, which utilizes graph design to effectively aggregate and propagate the query-related object contexts among the generated proposals for further refinement. By jointly training these two modules, we can avoid the inherent drawbacks of the complex proposals in the top-down framework and the coarse proposals in the bottom-up framework. Experimental results on the ScanRefer benchmark show that our framework is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junoh Lee, Chang-Yeon Won, Hyunjun Jung, Inhwan Bae, Hae-Gon Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large reconstruction models have made notable progress in generating high-quality 3D objects from single images. However, these methods often struggle with controllability, as they lack information from multiple views, leading to incomplete or inconsistent 3D reconstructions. To address this limitation, we introduce LucidFusion, a flexible end-to-end feed-forward framework that leverages the Relative Coordinate Map (RCM). Unlike traditional methods linking images to 3D world thorough pose, LucidFusion utilizes RCM to align geometric features coherently across different views, making it highly adaptable for 3D generation from arbitrary, unposed images. Furthermore, LucidFusion seamlessly integrates with the original single-image-to-3D pipeline, producing detailed 3D Gaussians at a resolution of $512 \times 512$, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianjun Gao, Chen Cai, Ruoyu Wang, Wenyang Liu, Kim-Hui Yap, Kratika Garg, Boon-Siew Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has seen advancements with Vision Language Models (VLMs), but these methods often depend on extensive manual annotations. Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can inherently recognize and reason about interactions at the image level but are computationally heavy and not designed for instance-level HOI detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Cross-Level HOI distillation (CL-HOI) framework, which distills instance-level HOIs from VLLMs image-level understanding without the need for manual annotations. Our approach involves two stages: context distillation, where a Visual Linguistic Translator (VLT) converts visual information into linguistic form, and interaction distillation, where an Interaction Cognition Network (ICN) reasons about spatial, visual, and context relations. We design contrastive distillation losses to transfer image-level context and interaction knowledge from the teacher to the student model, enabling instance-level HOI detection. Evaluations on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our CL-HOI surpasses existing weakly supervised methods and VLLM supervised methods, showing its efficacy in detecting HOIs without manual labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun-Kurl Jang, Jihun Kim, Hyeokjun Kweon, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to perform geometric completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously. Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Shi, Shaocheng Yan, Yilin Xiao, Xinyi Liu, Yongjun Zhang, Jiayuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Correspondence-based point cloud registration (PCR) plays a key role in robotics and computer vision. However, challenges like sensor noises, object occlusions, and descriptor limitations inevitably result in numerous outliers. RANSAC family is the most popular outlier removal solution. However, the requisite iterations escalate exponentially with the outlier ratio, rendering it far inferior to existing methods (SC2PCR [1], MAC [2], etc.) in terms of accuracy or speed. Thus, we propose a two-stage consensus filtering (TCF) that elevates RANSAC to state-of-the-art (SOTA) speed and accuracy. Firstly, one-point RANSAC obtains a consensus set based on length consistency. Subsequently, two-point RANSAC refines the set via angle consistency. Then, three-point RANSAC computes a coarse pose and removes outliers based on transformed correspondence's distances. Drawing on optimizations from one-point and two-point RANSAC, three-point RANSAC requires only a few iterations. Eventually, an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) is applied to yield the optimal pose. Experiments on the large-scale KITTI and ETH datasets demonstrate our method achieves up to three-orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to MAC while maintaining registration accuracy and recall.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Zhou, Bo Yang, Mengwen Yuan, Runhao Jiang, Rui Yan, Gang Pan, Huajin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), renowned for their low power consumption, brain-inspired architecture, and spatio-temporal representation capabilities, have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiping Ma, Shiyu Hu, Xuchen Li, Yipei Wang, Shiqing Liu, Kang Hao Cheong</p>
<p>Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been applied in expert systems across various domains, providing new opportunities for AI in Education. Educational interactions involve a cyclical exchange between teachers and students. Current research predominantly focuses on using LLMs to simulate teachers, leveraging their expertise to enhance student learning outcomes. However, the simulation of students, which could improve teachers' instructional skills, has received insufficient attention due to the challenges of modeling and evaluating virtual students. This research asks: Can LLMs be utilized to develop virtual student agents that mimic human-like behavior and individual variability? Unlike expert systems focusing on knowledge delivery, virtual students must replicate learning difficulties, emotional responses, and linguistic uncertainties. These traits present significant challenges in both modeling and evaluation. To address these issues, this study focuses on language learning as a context for modeling virtual student agents. We propose a novel AI4Education framework, called SOE (Scene-Object-Evaluation), to systematically construct LVSA (LLM-based Virtual Student Agents). By curating a dataset of personalized teacher-student interactions with various personality traits, question types, and learning stages, and fine-tuning LLMs using LoRA, we conduct multi-dimensional evaluation experiments. Specifically, we: (1) develop a theoretical framework for generating LVSA; (2) integrate human subjective evaluation metrics into GPT-4 assessments, demonstrating a strong correlation between human evaluators and GPT-4 in judging LVSA authenticity; and (3) validate that LLMs can generate human-like, personalized virtual student agents in educational contexts, laying a foundation for future applications in pre-service teacher training and multi-agent simulation environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach towards learning compositional representations that can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as prediction and reasoning. Recently, it was shown that pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be useful to learn object-centric representations on real-world video datasets. However, while these approaches succeed at extracting objects from the scenes, the slot-based representations fail to maintain temporal consistency across consecutive frames in a video, i.e. the mapping of objects to slots changes across the video. To address this, we introduce Conditional Autoregressive Slot Attention (CA-SA), a framework that enhances the temporal consistency of extracted object-centric representations in video-centric vision tasks. Leveraging an autoregressive prior network to condition representations on previous timesteps and a novel consistency loss function, CA-SA predicts future slot representations and imposes consistency across frames. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing that our proposed method outperforms the considered baselines on downstream tasks, such as video prediction and visual question-answering tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xumeng Han, Longhui Wei, Zhiyang Dou, Zipeng Wang, Chenhui Qiang, Xin He, Yingfei Sun, Zhenjun Han, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models embody the divide-and-conquer concept and are a promising approach for increasing model capacity, demonstrating excellent scalability across multiple domains. In this paper, we integrate the MoE structure into the classic Vision Transformer (ViT), naming it ViMoE, and explore the potential of applying MoE to vision through a comprehensive study on image classification. However, we observe that the performance is sensitive to the configuration of MoE layers, making it challenging to obtain optimal results without careful design. The underlying cause is that inappropriate MoE layers lead to unreliable routing and hinder experts from effectively acquiring helpful knowledge. To address this, we introduce a shared expert to learn and capture common information, serving as an effective way to construct stable ViMoE. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to analyze expert routing behavior, revealing which MoE layers are capable of specializing in handling specific information and which are not. This provides guidance for retaining the critical layers while removing redundancies, thereby advancing ViMoE to be more efficient without sacrificing accuracy. We aspire for this work to offer new insights into the design of vision MoE models and provide valuable empirical guidance for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yankai Jiang, Wenhui Lei, Xiaofan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training models have driven significant progress in zero-shot disease recognition. However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia. Codes will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Bing, Chaoyi Zhang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to the well-established technique of rasterization, vectorization of images poses a significant challenge in the field of computer graphics. Recent learning-based methods for converting raster images to vector formats frequently suffer from incomplete shapes, redundant path prediction, and a lack of accuracy in preserving the semantics of the original content. These shortcomings severely hinder the utility of these methods for further editing and manipulation of images. To address these challenges, we present DeepIcon, a novel hierarchical image vectorization network specifically tailored for generating variable-length icon vector graphics based on the raster image input. Our experimental results indicate that DeepIcon can efficiently produce Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) directly from raster images, bypassing the need for a differentiable rasterizer while also demonstrating a profound understanding of the image contents.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15766">How Important are Data Augmentations to Close the Domain Gap for Object Detection in Orbit?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Ulmer, Leonard Kl\"upfel, Maximilian Durner, Rudolph Triebel</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of data augmentations to close the domain gap in spaceborne computer vision, crucial for autonomous operations like on-orbit servicing. As the use of computer vision in space increases, challenges such as hostile illumination and low signal-to-noise ratios significantly hinder performance. While learning-based algorithms show promising results, their adoption is limited by the need for extensive annotated training data and the domain gap that arises from differences between synthesized and real-world imagery. This study explores domain generalization in terms of data augmentations -- classical color and geometric transformations, corruptions, and noise -- to enhance model performance across the domain gap. To this end, we conduct an large scale experiment using a hyperparameter optimization pipeline that samples hundreds of different configurations and searches for the best set to bridge the domain gap. As a reference task, we use 2D object detection and evaluate on the SPEED+ dataset that contains real hardware-in-the-loop satellite images in its test set. Moreover, we evaluate four popular object detectors, including Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO-v7, and the open set detector GroundingDINO, and highlight their trade-offs between performance, inference speed, and training time. Our results underscore the vital role of data augmentations in bridging the domain gap, improving model performance, robustness, and reliability for critical space applications. As a result, we propose two novel data augmentations specifically developed to emulate the visual effects observed in orbital imagery. We conclude by recommending the most effective augmentations for advancing computer vision in challenging orbital environments. Code for training detectors and hyperparameter search will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15767">Improving Instance Optimization in Deformable Image Registration with Gradient Projection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration is inherently a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, requiring a delicate balance between image similarity and deformation regularity. These conflicting objectives often lead to poor optimization outcomes, such as being trapped in unsatisfactory local minima or experiencing slow convergence. Deep learning methods have recently gained popularity in this domain due to their efficiency in processing large datasets and achieving high accuracy. However, they often underperform during test time compared to traditional optimization techniques, which further explore iterative, instance-specific gradient-based optimization. This performance gap is more pronounced when a distribution shift between training and test data exists. To address this issue, we focus on the instance optimization (IO) paradigm, which involves additional optimization for test-time instances based on a pre-trained model. IO effectively combines the generalization capabilities of deep learning with the fine-tuning advantages of instance-specific optimization. Within this framework, we emphasize the use of gradient projection to mitigate conflicting updates in MOO. This technique projects conflicting gradients into a common space, better aligning the dual objectives and enhancing optimization stability. We validate our method using a state-of-the-art foundation model on the 3D Brain inter-subject registration task (LUMIR) from the Learn2Reg 2024 Challenge. Our results show significant improvements over standard gradient descent, leading to more accurate and reliable registration results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Bing, Chaoyi Zhang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating and understanding art has long been a hallmark of human ability. When presented with finished digital artwork, professional graphic artists can intuitively deconstruct and replicate it using various drawing tools, such as the line tool, paint bucket, and layer features, including opacity and blending modes. While most recent research in this field has focused on art generation, proposing a range of methods, these often rely on the concept of artwork being represented as a final image. To bridge the gap between pixel-level results and the actual drawing process, we present an approach that treats a set of drawing tools as executable programs. This method predicts a sequence of steps to achieve the final image, allowing for understandable and resolution-independent reproductions under the usage of a set of drawing commands. Our experiments demonstrate that our program synthesizer, Art2Prog, can comprehensively understand complex input images and reproduce them using high-quality executable programs. The experimental results evidence the potential of machines to grasp higher-level information from images and generate compact program-level descriptions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15778">Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Latent Space Steering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Liu, Haotian Ye, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Liu, Claudio Affolter, Sidi Wu, Yizi Chen, Lorenz Hurni</p>
<p>Abstract: Historical maps provide valuable information and knowledge about the past. However, as they often feature non-standard projections, hand-drawn styles, and artistic elements, it is challenging for non-experts to identify and interpret them. While existing image captioning methods have achieved remarkable success on natural images, their performance on maps is suboptimal as maps are underrepresented in their pre-training process. Despite the recent advance of GPT-4 in text recognition and map captioning, it still has a limited understanding of maps, as its performance wanes when texts (e.g., titles and legends) in maps are missing or inaccurate. Besides, it is inefficient or even impractical to fine-tune the model with users' own datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel and lightweight map-captioning counterpart. Specifically, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art vision-language model CLIP to generate captions relevant to historical maps and enrich the captions with GPT-3.5 to tell a brief story regarding where, what, when and why of a given map. We propose a novel decision tree architecture to only generate captions relevant to the specified map type. Our system shows invariance to text alterations in maps. The system can be easily adapted and extended to other map types and scaled to a larger map captioning system. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/claudaff/automatic-map-storytelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Zhai, Jilin Mei, Chen Min, Liang Chen, Fangzhou Zhao, Yu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an essential part of autonomous driving, focusing on capturing the geometric details of scenes. Off-road environments are rich in geometric information, therefore it is suitable for 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks to reconstruct such scenes. However, most of researches concentrate on on-road environments, and few methods are designed for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In response to this gap, we introduce WildOcc, to our knowledge, the first benchmark to provide dense occupancy annotations for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks. A ground truth generation pipeline is proposed in this paper, which employs a coarse-to-fine reconstruction to achieve a more realistic result. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, which fuses spatio-temporal information from multi-frame images and point clouds at voxel level. In addition, a cross-modality distillation function is introduced, which transfers geometric knowledge from point clouds to image features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Water segmentation is critical to disaster response and water resource management. Authorities may employ high-resolution photography to monitor rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, allowing for more proactive management in agriculture, industry, and conservation. Deep learning has improved flood monitoring by allowing models like CNNs, U-Nets, and transformers to handle large volumes of satellite and aerial data. However, these models usually have significant processing requirements, limiting their usage in real-time applications. This research proposes upgrading the SegFormer model for water segmentation by data augmentation with datasets such as ADE20K and RIWA to boost generalization. We examine how inductive bias affects attention-based models and discover that SegFormer performs better on bigger datasets. To further demonstrate the function of data augmentation, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used to lower processing complexity while preserving accuracy. We show that the suggested Habaek model outperforms current models in segmentation, with an Intersection over Union (IoU) ranging from 0.91986 to 0.94397. In terms of F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision, Habaek performs better than rival models, indicating its potential for real-world applications. This study highlights the need to enhance structures and include datasets for effective water segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongguang Li, Yueqi Cao, Jindong Li, Qi Wang, Shengsheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-UDA) aims to transfer a model's performance from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without direct access to source samples, addressing data privacy issues. However, most existing SF-UDA approaches assume the availability of abundant source domain samples, which is often impractical due to the high cost of data annotation. In this paper, we explore a more challenging scenario where direct access to source domain samples is restricted, and the source domain contains only a few samples. To tackle the dual challenges of limited source data and privacy concerns, we introduce a data-efficient, CLIP-powered dual-branch network (CDBN in short). We design a cross-modal dual-branch network that integrates source domain class semantics into the unsupervised fine-tuning of the target domain. It preserves the class information from the source domain while enhancing the model's generalization to the target domain. Additionally, we propose an unsupervised optimization strategy driven by accurate classification and diversity, which aims to retain the classification capability learned from the source domain while producing more confident and diverse predictions in the target domain. Extensive experiments across 31 transfer tasks on 7 public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of AI-assisted driving, numerous methods have emerged for ego-vehicle 3D perception tasks, but there has been limited research on roadside perception. With its ability to provide a global view and a broader sensing range, the roadside perspective is worth developing. LiDAR provides precise three-dimensional spatial information, while cameras offer semantic information. These two modalities are complementary in 3D detection. However, adding camera data does not increase accuracy in some studies since the information extraction and fusion procedure is not sufficiently reliable. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as replacements for MLPs, which are better suited for high-dimensional, complex data. Both the camera and the LiDAR provide high-dimensional information, and employing KANs should enhance the extraction of valuable features to produce better fusion outcomes. This paper proposes Kaninfradet3D, which optimizes the feature extraction and fusion modules. To extract features from complex high-dimensional data, the model's encoder and fuser modules were improved using KAN Layers. Cross-attention was applied to enhance feature fusion, and visual comparisons verified that camera features were more evenly integrated. This addressed the issue of camera features being abnormally concentrated, negatively impacting fusion. Compared to the benchmark, our approach shows improvements of +9.87 mAP and +10.64 mAP in the two viewpoints of the TUMTraf Intersection Dataset and an improvement of +1.40 mAP in the roadside end of the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset. The results indicate that Kaninfradet3D can effectively fuse features, demonstrating the potential of applying KANs in roadside perception tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose LiOn-XA, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach that combines LiDAR-Only Cross-Modal (X) learning with Adversarial training for 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation to bridge the domain gap arising from environmental and sensor setup changes. Unlike existing works that exploit multiple data modalities like point clouds and RGB image data, we address UDA in scenarios where RGB images might not be available and show that two distinct LiDAR data representations can learn from each other for UDA. More specifically, we leverage 3D voxelized point clouds to preserve important geometric structure in combination with 2D projection-based range images that provide information such as object orientations or surfaces. To further align the feature space between both domains, we apply adversarial training using both features and predictions of both 2D and 3D neural networks. Our experiments on 3 real-to-real adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving new state-of-the-art performance when compared to previous uni- and multi-model UDA methods.

<p>Abstract: In multi-view medical diagnosis, deep learning-based models often fuse information from different imaging perspectives to improve diagnostic performance. However, existing approaches are prone to overfitting and rely heavily on view-specific features, which can lead to trivial solutions. In this work, we introduce Random Token Fusion (RTF), a novel technique designed to enhance multi-view medical image analysis using vision transformers. By integrating randomness into the feature fusion process during training, RTF addresses the issue of overfitting and enhances the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic models without incurring any additional cost at inference. We validate our approach on standard mammography and chest X-ray benchmark datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RTF consistently improves the performance of existing fusion methods, paving the way for a new generation of multi-view medical foundation models.</p>

Their use throughout the history of visual arts and media is interesting to researchers and filmmakers alike. Our goal in this work is to recognise and classify these motifs by proposing a new machine learning model that uses a custom dataset to that end. We show how features extracted from a CLIP model can be leveraged by using a shallow network and an appropriate loss to classify images into 20 different motifs, with surprisingly good results: an $F_1$-score of 0.91 on our test set. We also present several ablation studies justifying the input features, architecture and hyperparameters used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Meseguer, Roc\'io del Amor, Valery Naranjo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language supervision has made remarkable strides in learning visual representations from textual guidance. In digital pathology, vision-language models (VLM), pre-trained on curated datasets of histological image-captions, have been adapted to downstream tasks, such as region of interest classification. Zero-shot transfer for slide-level prediction has been formulated by MI-Zero, but it exhibits high variability depending on the textual prompts. Inspired by prototypical learning, we propose MI-VisionShot, a training-free adaptation method on top of VLMs to predict slide-level labels in few-shot learning scenarios. Our framework takes advantage of the excellent representation learning of VLM to create prototype-based classifiers under a multiple-instance setting by retrieving the most discriminative patches within each slide. Experimentation through different settings shows the ability of MI-VisionShot to surpass zero-shot transfer with lower variability, even in low-shot scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Meseguer, Roc\'io del Amor, Adrian Colomer, Valery Naranjo</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the emergence of the ImageNet dataset, the pretraining and fine-tuning approach has become widely adopted in computer vision due to the ability of ImageNet-pretrained models to learn a wide variety of visual features. However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework. Results demonstrate the ability of foundation models to surpass ImageNet-pretrained models for the prediction of six skin cancer subtypes</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabien Poirier</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior by combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinze Li, Runlin Huang, Zhenghao Wu, Bohan Yang, Wentao Fan, Chengzhang Zhu, Weifeng Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely used to learn from both a few labeled images and many unlabeled images to overcome the scarcity of labeled samples in medical image segmentation. Most current SSL-based segmentation methods use pixel values directly to identify similar features in labeled and unlabeled data. They usually fail to accurately capture the intricate attachment structures in the left atrium, such as the areas of inconsistent density or exhibit outward curvatures, adding to the complexity of the task. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce an effective solution, CORAL(Correlation-Aligned)-Correlation Consistency Network (CORN), to capture the global structure shape and local details of Left Atrium. Diverging from previous methods focused on each local pixel value, the CORAL-Correlation Consistency Module (CCM) in the CORN leverages second-order statistical information to capture global structural features by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled samples in feature space. Yet, direct construction of features from unlabeled data frequently results in ``Sample Selection Bias'', leading to flawed supervision. We thus further propose the Dynamic Feature Pool (DFP) for the CCM, which utilizes a confidence-based filtering strategy to remove incorrectly selected features and regularize both teacher and student models by constraining the similarity matrix to be consistent. Extensive experiments on the Left Atrium dataset have shown that the proposed CORN outperforms previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15919">Are Large-scale Soft Labels Necessary for Large-scale Dataset Distillation?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingao Xiao, Yang He</p>
<p>Abstract: In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that of the condensed dataset by over 30 times. However, are large-scale soft labels necessary for large-scale dataset distillation? In this paper, we first discover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets necessitates the use of large-scale soft labels. This high within-class similarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from different classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN) matching. To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise supervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples within classes, instead of across classes. As a result, we can increase within-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels. A key benefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be achieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex rule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries. For example, when condensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the required soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40x compression) with a 2.6% performance gain.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15926">Mitigating Object Hallucination via Concentric Causal Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Xing, Yiheng Li, Ivan Laptev, Shijian Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) present remarkable zero-shot conversational and reasoning capabilities given multimodal queries. Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence. Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azmine Toushik Wasi, Taki Hasan Rafi, Raima Islam, Karlo Serbetar, Dong Kyu Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable facial expression learning (FEL) involves the effective learning of distinctive facial expression characteristics for more reliable, unbiased and accurate predictions in real-life settings. However, current systems struggle with FEL tasks because of the variance in people's facial expressions due to their unique facial structures, movements, tones, and demographics. Biased and imbalanced datasets compound this challenge, leading to wrong and biased prediction labels. To tackle these, we introduce GReFEL, leveraging Vision Transformers and a facial geometry-aware anchor-based reliability balancing module to combat imbalanced data distributions, bias, and uncertainty in facial expression learning. Integrating local and global data with anchors that learn different facial data points and structural features, our approach adjusts biased and mislabeled emotions caused by intra-class disparity, inter-class similarity, and scale sensitivity, resulting in comprehensive, accurate, and reliable facial expression predictions. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Birds-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation aims to establish a spatial mapping from the perspective view to the top view and estimate the semantic maps from monocular images. Recent studies have encountered difficulties in view transformation due to the disruption of BEV-agnostic features in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel FocusBEV framework consisting of $(i)$ a self-calibrated cross view transformation module to suppress the BEV-agnostic image areas and focus on the BEV-relevant areas in the view transformation stage, $(ii)$ a plug-and-play ego-motion-based temporal fusion module to exploit the spatiotemporal structure consistency in BEV space with a memory bank, and $(iii)$ an occupancy-agnostic IoU loss to mitigate both semantic and positional uncertainties. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art on two popular benchmarks,\ie, 29.2\% mIoU on nuScenes and 35.2\% mIoU on Argoverse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Song, Weidong Yang, Zhijun Li, Wen-Ming Chen, Ben Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of point cloud upsampling (PCU) is to generate dense and uniform point clouds from sparse input captured by 3D sensors like LiDAR, holding potential applications in real yet is still a challenging task. Existing deep learning-based methods have shown significant achievements in this field. However, they still face limitations in effectively handling long sequences and addressing the issue of shrinkage artifacts around the surface of the point cloud. Inspired by the newly proposed Mamba, in this paper, we introduce a network named MBPU built on top of the Mamba architecture, which performs well in long sequence modeling, especially for large-scale point cloud upsampling, and achieves fast convergence speed. Moreover, MBPU is an arbitrary-scale upsampling framework as the predictor of point distance in the point refinement phase. At the same time, we simultaneously predict the 3D position shift and 1D point-to-point distance as regression quantities to constrain the global features while ensuring the accuracy of local details. We also introduce a fast differentiable renderer to further enhance the fidelity of the upsampled point cloud and reduce artifacts. It is noted that, by the merits of our fast point rendering, MBPU yields high-quality upsampled point clouds by effectively eliminating surface noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our MBPU outperforms other off-the-shelf methods in terms of point cloud upsampling, especially for large-scale point clouds.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15957">CamI2V: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Diffusion Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangcong Zheng, Teng Li, Rui Jiang, Yehao Lu, Tao Wu, Xi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, camera pose, as a user-friendly and physics-related condition, has been introduced into text-to-video diffusion model for camera control. However, existing methods simply inject camera conditions through a side input. These approaches neglect the inherent physical knowledge of camera pose, resulting in imprecise camera control, inconsistencies, and also poor interpretability. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of integrating explicit physical constraints into model design. Epipolar attention is proposed for modeling all cross-frame relationships from a novel perspective of noised condition. This ensures that features are aggregated from corresponding epipolar lines in all noised frames, overcoming the limitations of current attention mechanisms in tracking displaced features across frames, especially when features move significantly with the camera and become obscured by noise. Additionally, we introduce register tokens to handle cases without intersections between frames, commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions. To support image-to-video, we propose the multiple guidance scale to allow for precise control for image, text, and camera, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to solve the inaccuracy and instability of existing camera control measurement. We achieve a 25.5\% improvement in camera controllability on RealEstate10K while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain images. Only 24GB and 12GB are required for training and inference, respectively. We plan to release checkpoints, along with training and evaluation codes.

<p>Abstract: Efficient vectorization of hand-drawn cadastral maps, such as Mouza maps in Bangladesh, poses a significant challenge due to their complex structures. Current manual digitization methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our study proposes a semi-automated approach to streamline the digitization process, saving both time and human resources. Our methodology focuses on separating the plot boundaries and plot identifiers and applying our digitization methodology to convert both of them into vectorized format. To accomplish full vectorization, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are utilized for pre-processing and plot number detection along with our smoothing algorithms based on the diversity of vector maps. The CNN models are trained with our own labeled dataset, generated from the maps, and smoothing algorithms are introduced from the various observations of the map's vector formats. Further human intervention remains essential for precision. We have evaluated our methods on several maps and provided both quantitative and qualitative results with user study. The result demonstrates that our methodology outperforms the existing map digitization processes significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsheng Zhou, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language and vision models have been leading a revolution in visual computing. By greatly scaling up sizes of data and model parameters, the large models learn deep priors which lead to remarkable performance in various tasks. In this work, we present deep prior assembly, a novel framework that assembles diverse deep priors from large models for scene reconstruction from single images in a zero-shot manner. We show that this challenging task can be done without extra knowledge but just simply generalizing one deep prior in one sub-task. To this end, we introduce novel methods related to poses, scales, and occlusion parsing which are keys to enable deep priors to work together in a robust way. Deep prior assembly does not require any 3D or 2D data-driven training in the task and demonstrates superior performance in generalizing priors to open-world scenes. We conduct evaluations on various datasets, and report analysis, numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods to show our superiority.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhen Zhao, Xin Wen, Jiahui Liu, Chuofan Ma, Chunfeng Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing training on long-tail data distributions remains a long-standing challenge in deep learning. While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling help alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to hinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations, particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a novel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets with finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative studies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of learned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation. Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similar to existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head and tail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To automate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve relevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of auxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing loss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the target dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary categories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming strong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongkuan Zhou, Lavdim Halilaj, Sebastian Monka, Stefan Schmid, Yuqicheng Zhu, Bo Xiong, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision, they fail to remain high-performing when facing distribution shifts between training and testing data. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided Visual representation learning (KGV), a distribution-based learning approach leveraging multi-modal prior knowledge, to improve generalization under distribution shift. We use prior knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a knowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2) generated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the KG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a common latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images as well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via a novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation embeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations respectively. We claim that incorporating multi-model prior knowledge enables more regularized learning of image representations. Thus, the models are able to better generalize across different data distributions. We evaluate KGV on different image classification tasks with major or minor distribution shifts, namely road sign classification across datasets from Germany, China, and Russia, image classification with the mini-ImageNet dataset and its variants, as well as the DVM-CAR dataset. The results demonstrate that KGV consistently exhibits higher accuracy and data efficiency than the baselines across all experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometry and texture estimation from a single face image is an ill-posed problem since there is very little information to work with. The problem further escalates when the face is rotated at a different angle. This paper tries to tackle this problem by introducing a novel method for texture estimation from a single image by first using StyleGAN and 3D Morphable Models. The method begins by generating multi-view faces using the latent space of GAN. Then 3DDFA trained on 3DMM estimates a 3D face mesh as well as a high-resolution texture map that is consistent with the estimated face shape. The result shows that the generated mesh is of high quality with near to accurate texture representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art RGB texture synthesis algorithms rely on style distances that are computed through statistics of deep features. These deep features are extracted by classification neural networks that have been trained on large datasets of RGB images. Extending such synthesis methods to multispectral images is not straightforward, since the pre-trained networks are designed for and have been trained on RGB images. In this work, we propose two solutions to extend these methods to multispectral imaging. Neither of them require additional training of the neural network from which the second order neural statistics are extracted. The first one consists in optimizing over batches of random triplets of spectral bands throughout training. The second one projects multispectral pixels onto a 3 dimensional space. We further explore the benefit of a color transfer operation upstream of the projection to avoid the potentially abnormal color distributions induced by the projection. Our experiments compare the performances of the various methods through different metrics. We demonstrate that they can be used to perform exemplar-based texture synthesis, achieve good visual quality and comes close to state-of-the art methods on RGB bands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity.

On the other hand, open-vocabulary object detection models bring closer visual and textual concepts in the same latent space, allowing zero-shot detection via prompting at small computational cost. We propose a lightweight method to turn the latter into a one-shot or few-shot object recognition models without requiring textual descriptions. Our experiments on the TEgO dataset using the YOLO-World model as a base show that performance increases with the model size, the number of examples and the use of image augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Cao, Lingqi Wang, Kexin Zhang, Yuting Yang, Licheng Jiao, Yuwei Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Road++ Track3 proposes a multi-label atomic activity recognition task in traffic scenarios, which can be standardized as a 64-class multi-label video action recognition task. In the multi-label atomic activity recognition task, the robustness of visual feature extraction remains a key challenge, which directly affects the model performance and generalization ability. To cope with these issues, our team optimized three aspects: data processing, model and post-processing. Firstly, the appropriate resolution and video sampling strategy are selected, and a fixed sampling strategy is set on the validation and test sets. Secondly, in terms of model training, the team selects a variety of visual backbone networks for feature extraction, and then introduces the action-slot model, which is trained on the training and validation sets, and reasoned on the test set. Finally, for post-processing, the team combined the strengths and weaknesses of different models for weighted fusion, and the final mAP on the test set was 58%, which is 4% higher than the challenge baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeaung Lee, Jeewoo Lim, Keunho Byeon, Jin Tae Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently emerged and demonstrated enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Wei Shen, Qingli Li, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of medical image segmentation usually requires a large number of high-quality labels. But since the labeling process is usually affected by the raters' varying skill levels and characteristics, the estimated masks provided by different raters usually suffer from high inter-rater variability. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Label Filling framework, termed as LF-Net, predicting the groundtruth segmentation label given only noisy annotations during training. The fundamental idea of label filling is to supervise the segmentation model by a subset of pixels with trustworthy labels, meanwhile filling labels of other pixels by mixed supervision. More concretely, we propose a qualified majority voting strategy, i.e., a threshold voting scheme is designed to model agreement among raters and the majority-voted labels of the selected subset of pixels are regarded as supervision. To fill labels of other pixels, two types of mixed auxiliary supervision are proposed: a soft label learned from intrinsic structures of noisy annotations, and raters' characteristics labels which propagate individual rater's characteristics information. LF-Net has two main advantages. 1) Training with trustworthy pixels incorporates training with confident supervision, guiding the direction of groundtruth label learning. 2) Two types of mixed supervision prevent over-fitting issues when the network is supervised by a subset of pixels, and guarantee high fidelity with the true label. Results on five datasets of diverse imaging modalities show that our LF-Net boosts segmentation accuracy in all datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods, with even a 7% improvement in DSC for MS lesion segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruting Chi, Zhiyi Huang, Yuexing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Small sample instance segmentation is a very challenging task, and many existing methods follow the training strategy of meta-learning which pre-train models on support set and fine-tune on query set. The pre-training phase, which is highly task related, requires a significant amount of additional training time and the selection of datasets with close proximity to ensure effectiveness. The article proposes a novel small sample instance segmentation solution from the perspective of maximizing the utilization of existing information without increasing annotation burden and training costs. The proposed method designs two modules to address the problems encountered in small sample instance segmentation. First, it helps the model fully utilize unlabeled data by learning to generate pseudo labels, increasing the number of available samples. Second, by integrating the features of text and image, more accurate classification results can be obtained. These two modules are suitable for box-free and box-dependent frameworks. In the way, the proposed method not only improves the performance of small sample instance segmentation, but also greatly reduce reliance on pre-training. We have conducted experiments in three datasets from different scenes: on land, underwater and under microscope. As evidenced by our experiments, integrated image-text corrects the confidence of classification, and pseudo labels help the model obtain preciser masks. All the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikun Zhang, Hao Yang, Yan Yang, Ying Fu, Liyuan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Image dehazing has drawn a significant attention in recent years. Learning-based methods usually require paired hazy and corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images for training. However, it is difficult to collect real-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods. Although several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic datasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and scene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of these methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen haze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality real-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and haze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing the size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times. Meanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose a mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which dynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity. Moreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model (LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed images. Experiments demonstrate that LMHaze dataset improves the dehazing performance in real scenarios and our dehazing method provides better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidan Boyd, Mohamed Trabelsi, Huseyin Uzunalioglu, Dan Kushnir</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding specifically where a model focuses on within an image is critical for human interpretability of the decision-making process. Deep learning-based solutions are prone to learning coincidental correlations in training datasets, causing over-fitting and reducing the explainability. Recent advances have shown that guiding models to human-defined regions of saliency within individual images significantly increases performance and interpretability. Human-guided models also exhibit greater generalization capabilities, as coincidental dataset features are avoided. Results show that models trained with saliency incorporation display an increase in interpretability of up to 30% over models trained without saliency information. The collection of this saliency information, however, can be costly, laborious and in some cases infeasible. To address this limitation, we propose a combination strategy of saliency incorporation and active learning to reduce the human annotation data required by 80% while maintaining the interpretability and performance increase from human saliency. Extensive experimentation outlines the effectiveness of the proposed approach across five public datasets and six active learning criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giannis Daras, Weili Nie, Karsten Kreis, Alex Dimakis, Morteza Mardani, Nikola Borislavov Kovachki, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162">Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Composite Spatial Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Ao Qu, Zhaokai Wang, Dingyi Zhuang, Zhaofeng Wu, Wei Ma, Shenhao Wang, Yunhan Zheng, Zhan Zhao, Jinhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much of the spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks (e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem). These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Zhan, Hongyin Zhao, Yousong Zhu, Fan Yang, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs in various vision-language and vision-centric tasks based on auto-regressive modeling. However, these models typically focus on either vision-centric tasks, such as visual grounding and region description, or vision-language tasks, like image caption and multi-scenario VQAs. None of the LMMs have yet comprehensively unified both types of tasks within a single model, as seen in Large Language Models in the natural language processing field. Furthermore, even with abundant multi-task instruction-following data, directly stacking these data for universal capabilities extension remains challenging. To address these issues, we introduce a novel multi-dimension curated and consolidated multimodal dataset, named CCMD-8M, which overcomes the data barriers of unifying vision-centric and vision-language tasks through multi-level data curation and multi-task consolidation. More importantly, we present Griffon-G, a general large multimodal model that addresses both vision-centric and vision-language tasks within a single end-to-end paradigm. Griffon-G resolves the training collapse issue encountered during the joint optimization of these tasks, achieving better training efficiency. Evaluations across multimodal benchmarks, general Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, scene text-centric VQA tasks, document-related VQA tasks, Referring Expression Comprehension, and object detection demonstrate that Griffon-G surpasses the advanced LMMs and achieves expert-level performance in complicated vision-centric tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16166">Beyond Filtering: Adaptive Image-Text Quality Enhancement for MLLM Pretraining</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Huang, Yuqi Huo, Zijia Zhao, Haoyu Lu, Shu Wu, Bingning Wang, Qiang Liu, Weipeng Chen, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by integrating visual and textual modalities. A critical factor in training MLLMs is the quality of image-text pairs within multimodal pretraining datasets. However, $\textit {de facto}$ filter-based data quality enhancement paradigms often discard a substantial portion of high-quality image data due to inadequate semantic alignment between images and texts, leading to inefficiencies in data utilization and scalability. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Image-Text Quality Enhancer (AITQE), a model that dynamically assesses and enhances the quality of image-text pairs. AITQE employs a text rewriting mechanism for low-quality pairs and incorporates a negative sample learning strategy to improve evaluative capabilities by integrating deliberately selected low-quality samples during training. Unlike prior approaches that significantly alter text distributions, our method minimally adjusts text to preserve data volume while enhancing quality. Experimental results demonstrate that AITQE surpasses existing methods on various benchmark, effectively leveraging raw data and scaling efficiently with increasing data volumes. We hope our work will inspire future works. The code and model are available at: https://github.com/hanhuang22/AITQE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16177">A Framework for Evaluating Predictive Models Using Synthetic Image Covariates and Longitudinal Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Deltadahl, Andreu Vall, Vijay Ivaturi, Niklas Korsbo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for synthesizing patient data with complex covariates (e.g., eye scans) paired with longitudinal observations (e.g., visual acuity over time), addressing privacy concerns in healthcare research. Our approach introduces controlled association in latent spaces generating each data modality, enabling the creation of complex covariate-longitudinal observation pairs. This framework facilitates the development of predictive models and provides openly available benchmarking datasets for healthcare research. We demonstrate our framework using optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, though it is applicable across domains. Using 109,309 2D OCT scan slices, we trained an image generative model combining a variational autoencoder and a diffusion model. Longitudinal observations were simulated using a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) model from a low-dimensional space of random effects. We generated 1.1M OCT scan slices paired with five sets of longitudinal observations at controlled association levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5.26%, and 2% of between-subject variability). To assess the framework, we modeled synthetic longitudinal observations with another NLME model, computed empirical Bayes estimates of random effects, and trained a ResNet to predict these estimates from synthetic OCT scans. We then incorporated ResNet predictions into the NLME model for patient-individualized predictions. Prediction accuracy on withheld data declined as intended with reduced association between images and longitudinal measurements. Notably, in all but the 2% case, we achieved within 50% of the theoretical best possible prediction on withheld data, demonstrating our ability to detect even weak signals. This confirms the effectiveness of our framework in generating synthetic data with controlled levels of association, providing a valuable tool for healthcare research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidan Boyd, Patrick Tinsley, Kevin W. Bowyer, Adam Czajka</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores how human judgement about salient regions of an image can be introduced into deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) training. Traditionally, training of DCNNs is purely data-driven. This often results in learning features of the data that are only coincidentally correlated with class labels. Human saliency can guide network training using our proposed new component of the loss function that ConveYs Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG) and penalizes the model for using non-salient regions. This mechanism produces DCNNs achieving higher accuracy and generalization compared to using the same training data without human salience. Experimental results demonstrate that CYBORG applies across multiple network architectures and problem domains (detection of synthetic faces, iris presentation attacks and anomalies in chest X-rays), while requiring significantly less data than training without human saliency guidance. Visualizations show that CYBORG-trained models' saliency is more consistent across independent training runs than traditionally-trained models, and also in better agreement with humans. To lower the cost of collecting human annotations, we also explore using deep learning to provide automated annotations. CYBORG training of CNNs addresses important issues such as reducing the appetite for large training sets, increasing interpretability, and reducing fragility by generalizing better to new types of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Cai, Jiangning Zhang, Haoyang He, Xinwei He, Ao Tong, Zhenye Gan, Chengjie Wang, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16255">Revisiting Deep Feature Reconstruction for Logical and Structural Industrial Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukanya Patra, Souhaib Ben Taieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is crucial for quality control and predictive maintenance, but it presents challenges due to limited training data, diverse anomaly types, and external factors that alter object appearances. Existing methods commonly detect structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, by leveraging multi-scale features from image patches extracted through deep pre-trained networks. However, significant memory and computational demands often limit their practical application. Additionally, detecting logical anomalies-such as images with missing or excess elements-requires an understanding of spatial relationships that traditional patch-based methods fail to capture. In this work, we address these limitations by focusing on Deep Feature Reconstruction (DFR), a memory- and compute-efficient approach for detecting structural anomalies. We further enhance DFR into a unified framework, called ULSAD, which is capable of detecting both structural and logical anomalies. Specifically, we refine the DFR training objective to improve performance in structural anomaly detection, while introducing an attention-based loss mechanism using a global autoencoder-like network to handle logical anomaly detection. Our empirical evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates the performance of ULSAD in detecting and localizing both structural and logical anomalies, outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods. An extensive ablation study further highlights the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement.

<p>Abstract: The success of autoregressive (AR) language models in text generation has inspired the computer vision community to adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) for image generation. However, considering the essential differences between text and image modalities, the design space of language models for image generation remains underexplored. We observe that image tokens exhibit greater randomness compared to text tokens, which presents challenges when training with token prediction. Nevertheless, AR models demonstrate their potential by effectively learning patterns even from a seemingly suboptimal optimization problem. Our analysis also reveals that while all models successfully grasp the importance of local information in image generation, smaller models struggle to capture the global context. In contrast, larger models showcase improved capabilities in this area, helping to explain the performance gains achieved when scaling up model size. We further elucidate the design space of language models for vision generation, including tokenizer choice, model choice, model scalability, vocabulary design, and sampling strategy through extensive comparative experiments. Our work is the first to analyze the optimization behavior of language models in vision generation, and we believe it can inspire more effective designs when applying LMs to other domains. Finally, our elucidated language model for image generation, termed as ELM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 256*256 benchmark.

<p>Abstract: We present Agent-to-Sim (ATS), a framework for learning interactive behavior models of 3D agents from casual longitudinal video collections. Different from prior works that rely on marker-based tracking and multiview cameras, ATS learns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively through video observations recorded over a long time-span (e.g., a month) in a single environment. Modeling 3D behavior of an agent requires persistent 3D tracking (e.g., knowing which point corresponds to which) over a long time period. To obtain such data, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration method that tracks the agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in a complete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. We then train a generative model of agent behaviors using paired data of perception and motion of an agent queried from the 4D reconstruction. ATS enables real-to-sim transfer from video recordings of an agent to an interactive behavior simulator. We demonstrate results on pets (e.g., cat, dog, bunny) and human given monocular RGBD videos captured by a smartphone.</p>

In this work, we introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1B to 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters. This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our models more accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios. To further promote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation framework for Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperform specialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medical images, and remote sensing. We believe that our study can provide valuable insights and resources to advance the development of efficient and effective MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Liu, Chaoyi Zhou, Siyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis aims to generate novel views of a scene from multiple input images or videos, and recent advancements like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) have achieved notable success in producing photorealistic renderings with efficient pipelines. However, generating high-quality novel views under challenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to insufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing the representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video diffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem, reformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generation process. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal decoder. The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, significantly improving its rendering performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of unbounded scenes demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yields superior reconstruction performance and high-fidelity rendering results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael S. Ryoo, Honglu Zhou, Shrikant Kendre, Can Qin, Le Xue, Manli Shu, Silvio Savarese, Ran Xu, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles</p>
<p>Abstract: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangrui Ding, Rui Qian, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Yuwei Guo, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chin-Yang Lin, Chung-Ho Wu, Chang-Han Yeh, Shih-Han Yen, Cheng Sun, Yu-Lun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in few-shot scenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times for high-fidelity rendering. Existing methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors, enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghua Chen, Yushi Lan, Yongwei Chen, Yifan Zhou, Xingang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Drag-based editing has become popular in 2D content creation, driven by the capabilities of image generative models. However, extending this technique to 3D remains a challenge. Existing 3D drag-based editing methods, whether employing explicit spatial transformations or relying on implicit latent optimization within limited-capacity 3D generative models, fall short in handling significant topology changes or generating new textures across diverse object categories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MVDrag3D, a novel framework for more flexible and creative drag-based 3D editing that leverages multi-view generation and reconstruction priors. At the core of our approach is the usage of a multi-view diffusion model as a strong generative prior to perform consistent drag editing over multiple rendered views, which is followed by a reconstruction model that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of the edited object. While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment between different views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks that adjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned. In addition, we propose a multi-view score function that distills generative priors from multiple views to further enhance the view consistency and visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVDrag3D provides a precise, generative, and flexible solution for 3D drag-based editing, supporting more versatile editing effects across various object categories and 3D representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwon Youn, Dong Woo Kang, Hyun Kook Lim, Mansu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory and cognitive decline, affecting millions worldwide. Diagnosing AD is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and variable progression. This study introduces a novel brain-aware readout layer (BA readout layer) for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), designed to improve interpretability and predictive accuracy in neuroimaging for early AD diagnosis. By clustering brain regions based on functional connectivity and node embedding, this layer improves the GNN's capability to capture complex brain network characteristics. We analyzed neuroimaging data from 383 participants, including both cognitively normal and preclinical AD individuals, using T1-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI, and FBB-PET to construct brain graphs. Our results show that GNNs with the BA readout layer significantly outperform traditional models in predicting the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) score, demonstrating higher robustness and stability. The adaptive BA readout layer also offers enhanced interpretability by highlighting task-specific brain regions critical to cognitive functions impacted by AD. These findings suggest that our approach provides a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and analysis of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now increasingly being merged with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable new capabilities, particularly in terms of improved interactivity and open-ended responsiveness. While these are remarkable capabilities, the contribution of LLMs to enhancing the longstanding key problem of classifying an image among a set of choices remains unclear. Through extensive experiments involving seven models, ten visual understanding datasets, and multiple prompt variations per dataset, we find that, for object and scene recognition, VLMs that do not leverage LLMs can achieve better performance than VLMs that do. Yet at the same time, leveraging LLMs can improve performance on tasks requiring reasoning and outside knowledge. In response to these challenges, we propose a pragmatic solution: a lightweight fix involving a relatively small LLM that efficiently routes visual tasks to the most suitable model for the task. The LLM router undergoes training using a dataset constructed from more than 2.5 million examples of pairs of visual task and model accuracy. Our results reveal that this lightweight fix surpasses or matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art alternatives, including GPT-4V and HuggingGPT, while improving cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Li, Yao Lu, Zeyu Dong, Chuanguang Yang, Yihao Chen, Jianping Gou</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based networks on resource-constrained devices remains a significant challenge due to their high computational and parameter requirements. To solve this problem, layer pruning has emerged as a potent approach to reduce network size and improve computational efficiency. However, existing layer pruning methods mostly overlook the intrinsic connections and inter-dependencies between different layers within complicated deep neural networks. This oversight can result in pruned models that do not preserve the essential characteristics of the pre-trained network as effectively as desired. To address this limitations, we propose a Similarity Guided fast Layer Partition pruning for compressing large deep models (SGLP), which focuses on pruning layers from network segments partitioned via representation similarity. Specifically, our presented method first leverages Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to indicate the internal representations among the layers of the pre-trained network, which provides us with a potent basis for layer pruning. Based on similarity matrix derived from CKA, we employ Fisher Optimal Segmentation to partition the network into multiple segments, which provides a basis for removing the layers in a segment-wise manner. In addition, our method innovatively adopts GradNorm for segment-wise layer importance evaluation, eliminating the need for extensive fine-tuning, and finally prunes the unimportant layers to obtain a compact network. Experimental results in image classification and for large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that our proposed SGLP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, presenting a more effective solution for deploying DNNs on resource-limited platforms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munsif Ali, Leonardo Rossi, Massimo Bertozzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot and continual learning face two well-known challenges in GANs: overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Learning new tasks results in catastrophic forgetting in deep learning models. In the case of a few-shot setting, the model learns from a very limited number of samples (e.g. 10 samples), which can lead to overfitting and mode collapse. So, this paper proposes a Continual Few-shot Teacher-Student technique for the generative adversarial network (CFTS-GAN) that considers both challenges together. Our CFTS-GAN uses an adapter module as a student to learn a new task without affecting the previous knowledge. To make the student model efficient in learning new tasks, the knowledge from a teacher model is distilled to the student. In addition, the Cross-Domain Correspondence (CDC) loss is used by both teacher and student to promote diversity and to avoid mode collapse. Moreover, an effective strategy of freezing the discriminator is also utilized for enhancing performance. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate more diverse image synthesis and produce qualitative samples comparatively good to very stronger state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making early diagnosis critical for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient prognosis. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, which analyze CT images, have proven effective in detecting and classifying pulmonary nodules, significantly enhancing the detection rate of early-stage lung cancer. Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as SVM and KNN, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The integration of ensemble models and novel techniques is also discussed, emphasizing the latest developments in lung cancer diagnosis. Deep learning algorithms, combined with various analytical techniques, have markedly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule analysis, surpassing traditional methods, particularly in nodule classification. Although challenges remain, continuous technological advancements are expected to further strengthen the role of deep learning in medical diagnostics, especially for early lung cancer detection and diagnosis.

<p>Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is today considered a vital tool in the field of biological image categorization, segmentation, and other related tasks. The current breakthrough in computer vision algorithms and deep learning approaches has substantially enhanced the effectiveness and precision of apps built to recognize and locate regions of interest inside medical photographs. Among the different disciplines of medical image analysis, bone fracture detection, and classification have exhibited exceptional potential. Although numerous imaging modalities are applied in medical diagnostics, X-rays are particularly significant in this sector due to their broad availability, ease of use, and extensive information extraction capabilities. This research studies bone fracture categorization using the FracAtlas dataset, which comprises 4,083 musculoskeletal radiography pictures. Given the transformational development in transfer learning, particularly its efficacy in medical image processing, we deploy an attention-based transfer learning model to detect bone fractures in X-ray scans. Though the popular InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 deep learning models have been widely used, they still have the potential to be employed in crucial jobs. In this research, alongside transfer learning, a separate attention mechanism is also applied to boost the capabilities of transfer learning techniques. Through rigorous optimization, our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of more than 90\% in fracture classification. This work contributes to the expanding corpus of research focused on the application of transfer learning to medical imaging, notably in the context of X-ray processing, and emphasizes the promise for additional exploration in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyun Lee, Yilun Xu, Tomas Geffner, Giulia Fanti, Karsten Kreis, Arash Vahdat, Weili Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from diffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the probability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times64$ datasets show that our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\times$ smaller networks.

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the application of an artificial neural network framework for analysing water pollution caused by solids. Water pollution by suspended solids poses significant environmental and health risks. Traditional methods for assessing and predicting pollution levels are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address these challenges, we developed a model that leverages a comprehensive dataset of water quality from total suspended solids. A convolutional neural network was trained under a transfer learning approach using data corresponding to different total suspended solids concentrations, with the goal of accurately predicting low, medium and high pollution levels based on various input variables. Our model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, outperforming conventional statistical methods in terms of both speed and reliability. The results suggest that the artificial neural network framework can serve as an effective tool for real-time monitoring and management of water pollution, facilitating proactive decision-making and policy formulation. This approach not only enhances our understanding of pollution dynamics but also underscores the potential of machine learning techniques in environmental science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, yet they face challenges in the medical domain due to limited specialized knowledge. While recent medical MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in lab settings, they often struggle in real-world applications, highlighting a substantial gap between research and practice. In this paper, we seek to address this gap at various stages of the end-to-end learning pipeline, including data collection, model fine-tuning, and evaluation. At the data collection stage, we introduce SemiHVision, a dataset that combines human annotations with automated augmentation techniques to improve both medical knowledge representation and diagnostic reasoning. For model fine-tuning, we trained PMC-Cambrian-8B-AN over 2400 H100 GPU hours, resulting in performance that surpasses public medical models like HuatuoGPT-Vision-34B (79.0% vs. 66.7%) and private general models like Claude3-Opus (55.7%) on traditional benchmarks such as SLAKE and VQA-RAD. In the evaluation phase, we observed that traditional benchmarks cannot accurately reflect realistic clinical task capabilities. To overcome this limitation and provide more targeted guidance for model evaluation, we introduce the JAMA Clinical Challenge, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate diagnostic reasoning. On this benchmark, PMC-Cambrian-AN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a GPT-4 score of 1.29, significantly outperforming HuatuoGPT-Vision-34B (1.13) and Claude3-Opus (1.17), demonstrating its superior diagnostic reasoning abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqiu Wang, Zhaohu Xing, Weitong Wu, Yijun Yang, Qingqing Tang, Meixia Zhang, Yanwu Xu, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fundus imaging is a pivotal tool in ophthalmology, and different imaging modalities are characterized by their specific advantages. For example, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) uniquely provides detailed insights into retinal vascular dynamics and pathology, surpassing Color Fundus Photographs (CFP) in detecting microvascular abnormalities and perfusion status. However, the conventional invasive FFA involves discomfort and risks due to fluorescein dye injection, and it is meaningful but challenging to synthesize FFA images from non-invasive CFP. Previous studies primarily focused on FFA synthesis in a single disease category. In this work, we explore FFA synthesis in multiple diseases by devising a Diffusion-guided generative adversarial network, which introduces an adaptive and dynamic diffusion forward process into the discriminator and adds a category-aware representation enhancer. Moreover, to facilitate this research, we collect the first multi-disease CFP and FFA paired dataset, named the Multi-disease Paired Ocular Synthesis (MPOS) dataset, with four different fundus diseases. Experimental results show that our FFA synthesis network can generate better FFA images compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a paired-modal diagnostic network to validate the effectiveness of synthetic FFA images in the diagnosis of multiple fundus diseases, and the results show that our synthesized FFA images with the real CFP images have higher diagnosis accuracy than that of the compared FFA synthesizing methods. Our research bridges the gap between non-invasive imaging and FFA, thereby offering promising prospects to enhance ophthalmic diagnosis and patient care, with a focus on reducing harm to patients through non-invasive procedures. Our dataset and code will be released to support further research in this field (https://github.com/whq-xxh/FFA-Synthesis).</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of single-photon image sensors has opened the door to a plethora of high-speed and low-light imaging applications. However, data collected by these sensors are often 1-bit or few-bit, and corrupted by noise and strong motion. Conventional video restoration methods are not designed to handle this situation, while specialized quanta burst algorithms have limited performance when the number of input frames is low. In this paper, we introduce Quanta Video Restoration (QUIVER), an end-to-end trainable network built on the core ideas of classical quanta restoration methods, i.e., pre-filtering, flow estimation, fusion, and refinement. We also collect and publish I2-2000FPS, a high-speed video dataset with the highest temporal resolution of 2000 frames-per-second, for training and testing. On simulated and real data, QUIVER outperforms existing quanta restoration methods by a significant margin.

<p>Abstract: The aggressiveness of prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men worldwide, is primarily assessed based on histopathological data using the Gleason scoring system. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in accurately predicting Gleason scores, these predictions often lack inherent explainability, potentially leading to distrust in human-machine interactions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset of 1,015 tissue microarray core images, annotated by an international group of 54 pathologists. The annotations provide detailed localized pattern descriptions for Gleason grading in line with international guidelines. Utilizing this dataset, we develop an inherently explainable AI system based on a U-Net architecture that provides predictions leveraging pathologists' terminology. This approach circumvents post-hoc explainability methods while maintaining or exceeding the performance of methods trained directly for Gleason pattern segmentation (Dice score: 0.713 $\pm$ 0.003 trained on explanations vs. 0.691 $\pm$ 0.010 trained on Gleason patterns). By employing soft labels during training, we capture the intrinsic uncertainty in the data, yielding strong results in Gleason pattern segmentation even in the context of high interobserver variability. With the release of this dataset, we aim to encourage further research into segmentation in medical tasks with high levels of subjectivity and to advance the understanding of pathologists' reasoning processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li, Wenhui Zhu, Xuanzhao Dong, Oana M. Dumitrascu, Yalin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, CNN-based U-shaped networks have succeeded in medical image segmentation and are widely applied for various tasks. However, their limitations in capturing global features hinder their performance in complex segmentation tasks. The rise of Vision Transformer (ViT) has effectively compensated for this deficiency of CNNs and promoted the application of ViT-based U-networks in medical image segmentation. However, the high computational demands of ViT make it unsuitable for many medical devices and mobile platforms with limited resources, restricting its deployment on resource-constrained and edge devices. To address this, we propose EViT-UNet, an efficient ViT-based segmentation network that reduces computational complexity while maintaining accuracy, making it ideal for resource-constrained medical devices. EViT-UNet is built on a U-shaped architecture, comprising an encoder, decoder, bottleneck layer, and skip connections, combining convolutional operations with self-attention mechanisms to optimize efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that EViT-UNet achieves high accuracy in medical image segmentation while significantly reducing computational complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyuk Seo, Hyunseo Koh, Jonghyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of online continual learning (CL) advocates single-epoch training and imposes restrictions on the size of replay memory. However, single-epoch training would incur a different amount of computations per CL algorithm, and the additional storage cost to store logit or model in addition to replay memory is largely ignored in calculating the storage budget. Arguing different computational and storage budgets hinder fair comparison among CL algorithms in practice, we propose to use floating point operations (FLOPs) and total memory size in Byte as a metric for computational and memory budgets, respectively, to compare and develop CL algorithms in the same 'total resource budget.' To improve a CL method in a limited total budget, we propose adaptive layer freezing that does not update the layers for less informative batches to reduce computational costs with a negligible loss of accuracy. In addition, we propose a memory retrieval method that allows the model to learn the same amount of knowledge as using random retrieval in fewer iterations. Empirical validations on the CIFAR-10/100, CLEAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods within the same total budget</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prajol Shrestha, Mikhail Kulyabin, Aline Sindel, Hilde R. Pedersen, Stuart Gilson, Rigmor Baraas, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cone cells in the retina are essential for diagnosing and managing retinal diseases. In this study, we used advanced imaging techniques, including confocal and non-confocal split detector images from adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO), to analyze photoreceptors for improved accuracy. Precise segmentation is crucial for understanding each cone cell's shape, area, and distribution. It helps to estimate the surrounding areas occupied by rods, which allows the calculation of the density of cone photoreceptors in the area of interest. In turn, density is critical for evaluating overall retinal health and functionality. We explored two U-Net-based segmentation models: StarDist for confocal and Cellpose for calculated modalities. Analyzing cone cells in images from two modalities and achieving consistent results demonstrates the study's reliability and potential for clinical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. P. Rad\"unz, L. Portella, R. S. Oliveira, F. M. Bayer, R. J. Cintra</p>
<p>Abstract: The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a central tool for image and video coding because it can be related to the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT), which is the optimal transform in terms of retained transform coefficients and data decorrelation. In this paper, we introduce 16-, 32-, and 64-point low-complexity DCT approximations by minimizing individually the angle between the rows of the exact DCT matrix and the matrix induced by the approximate transforms. According to some classical figures of merit, the proposed transforms outperformed the approximations for the DCT already known in the literature. Fast algorithms were also developed for the low-complexity transforms, asserting a good balance between the performance and its computational cost. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the transforms in this context. In fact, the experiments showed that the proposed transforms had better results than the known approximations in the literature for the cases of 16, 32, and 64 blocklength.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniya Najiha Abdul Kareem, Mustansar Fiaz, Noa Novershtern, Jacob Hanna, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation is a fundamental problem in medical image analysis where the objective is to accurately classify a given 3D volumetric medical image with voxel-level precision. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical encoder-decoder-based framework that strives to explicitly capture the local and global dependencies for volumetric 3D medical image segmentation. The proposed framework exploits local volume-based self-attention to encode the local dependencies at high resolution and introduces a novel volumetric MLP-mixer to capture the global dependencies at low-resolution feature representations, respectively. The proposed volumetric MLP-mixer learns better associations among volumetric feature representations. These explicit local and global feature representations contribute to better learning of the shape-boundary characteristics of the organs. Extensive experiments on three different datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On the challenging Synapse Multi-organ dataset, the proposed method achieves an absolute 3.82\% gain over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of HD95 evaluation metrics {while a similar improvement pattern is exhibited in MSD Liver and Pancreas tumor datasets}. We also provide a detailed comparison between recent architectural design choices in the 2D computer vision literature by adapting them for the problem of 3D medical image segmentation. Finally, our experiments on the ZebraFish 3D cell membrane dataset having limited training data demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of the proposed vMixer model on the challenging 3D cell instance segmentation task, where accurate boundary prediction plays a vital role in distinguishing individual cell instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungwon Song, Hyungtae Lim, Alex Junho Lee, Hyun Myung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive research in robust visual-inertial navigation systems~(VINS) in dynamic environments, many approaches remain vulnerable to objects that suddenly start moving, which are referred to as \textit{abruptly dynamic objects}. In addition, most approaches have considered the effect of dynamic objects only at the feature association level. In this study, we observed that the state estimation diverges when errors from false correspondences owing to moving objects incorrectly propagate into the IMU bias terms. To overcome these problems, we propose a robust VINS framework called \mbox{\textit{DynaVINS++}}, which employs a) adaptive truncated least square method that adaptively adjusts the truncation range using both feature association and IMU preintegration to effectively minimize the effect of the dynamic objects while reducing the computational cost, and b)~stable state recovery with bias consistency check to correct misestimated IMU bias and to prevent the divergence caused by abruptly dynamic objects. As verified in both public and real-world datasets, our approach shows promising performance in dynamic environments, including scenes with abruptly dynamic objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Mohammad Ahmadi, Koorosh Aslansefat, Ruben Valcarce-Dineiro, Joshua Barnfather</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world, the significance of explainable AI (XAI) is growing in robotics and point cloud applications, as the lack of transparency in decision-making can pose considerable safety risks, particularly in autonomous systems. As these technologies are integrated into real-world environments, ensuring that model decisions are interpretable and trustworthy is vital for operational reliability and safety assurance. This study explores the implementation of SMILE, a novel explainability method originally designed for deep neural networks, on point cloud-based models. SMILE builds on LIME by incorporating Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) statistical distances, offering enhanced robustness and interpretability, particularly when the Anderson-Darling distance is used. The approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of fidelity loss, R2 scores, and robustness across various kernel widths, perturbation numbers, and clustering configurations. Moreover, this study introduces a stability analysis for point cloud data using the Jaccard index, establishing a new benchmark and baseline for model stability in this field. The study further identifies dataset biases in the classification of the 'person' category, emphasizing the necessity for more comprehensive datasets in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics. The results underscore the potential of advanced explainability models and highlight areas for future research, including the application of alternative surrogate models and explainability techniques in point cloud data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjun Du, Wenfang Sun, Cees G. M. Snoek</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenelle Feather, David Lipshutz, Sarah E. Harvey, Alex H. Williams, Eero P. Simoncelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Image representations (artificial or biological) are often compared in terms of their global geometry; however, representations with similar global structure can have strikingly different local geometries. Here, we propose a framework for comparing a set of image representations in terms of their local geometries. We quantify the local geometry of a representation using the Fisher information matrix, a standard statistical tool for characterizing the sensitivity to local stimulus distortions, and use this as a substrate for a metric on the local geometry in the vicinity of a base image. This metric may then be used to optimally differentiate a set of models, by finding a pair of "principal distortions" that maximize the variance of the models under this metric. We use this framework to compare a set of simple models of the early visual system, identifying a novel set of image distortions that allow immediate comparison of the models by visual inspection. In a second example, we apply our method to a set of deep neural network models and reveal differences in the local geometry that arise due to architecture and training types. These examples highlight how our framework can be used to probe for informative differences in local sensitivities between complex computational models, and suggest how it could be used to compare model representations with human perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Hesham Khater, Abdullahi Sani Shuaib, Sami Ul Haq, Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-rays (X-ray images) have been proven to be effective for the diagnosis of chest diseases, including Pneumonia, Lung Opacity, and COVID-19. However, relying on traditional medical methods for diagnosis from X-ray images is prone to delays and inaccuracies because the medical personnel who evaluate the X-ray images may have preconceived biases. For this reason, researchers have proposed the use of deep learning-based techniques to facilitate the diagnosis process. The preeminent method is the use of sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a novel detection model named \textbf{AttCDCNet} for the task of X-ray image diagnosis, enhancing the popular DenseNet121 model by adding an attention block to help the model focus on the most relevant regions, using focal loss as a loss function to overcome the imbalance of the dataset problem, and utilizing depth-wise convolution to reduce the parameters to make the model lighter. Through extensive experimental evaluations, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance, showing better results than the original DenseNet121. The proposed model achieved an accuracy, precision and recall of 94.94%, 95.14% and 94.53%, respectively, on the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Vision and Language models (VLMs) become accessible across the globe, it is important that they demonstrate cultural knowledge. In this paper, we introduce CROPE, a visual question answering benchmark designed to probe the knowledge of culture-specific concepts and evaluate the capacity for cultural adaptation through contextual information. This allows us to distinguish between parametric knowledge acquired during training and contextual knowledge provided during inference via visual and textual descriptions. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art open VLMs shows large performance disparities between culture-specific and common concepts in the parametric setting. Moreover, experiments with contextual knowledge indicate that models struggle to effectively utilize multimodal information and bind culture-specific concepts to their depictions. Our findings reveal limitations in the cultural understanding and adaptability of current VLMs that need to be addressed toward more culturally inclusive models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Renal tumors, especially renal cell carcinoma (RCC), show significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for diagnosis using radiology images such as MRI, echocardiograms, and CT scans. U-Net based deep learning techniques are emerging as a promising approach for automated medical image segmentation for minimally invasive diagnosis of renal tumors. However, current techniques need further improvements in accuracy to become clinically useful to radiologists. In this study, we present an improved U-Net based model for end-to-end automated semantic segmentation of CT scan images to identify renal tumors. The model uses residual connections across convolution layers, integrates a multi-layer feature fusion (MFF) and cross-channel attention (CCA) within encoder blocks, and incorporates skip connections augmented with additional information derived using MFF and CCA. We evaluated our model on the KiTS19 dataset, which contains data from 210 patients. For kidney segmentation, our model achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.97 and a Jaccard index (JI) of 0.95. For renal tumor segmentation, our model achieves a DSC of 0.96 and a JI of 0.91. Based on a comparison of available DSC scores, our model outperforms the current leading models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Saha, Abrar Fahim, Alona Fyshe, Alex Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: For specialized domains, there is often not a wealth of data with which to train large machine learning models. In such limited data / compute settings, various methods exist aiming to $\textit{do more with less}$, such as finetuning from a pretrained model, modulating difficulty levels as data are presented to a model (curriculum learning), and considering the role of model type / size. Approaches to efficient $\textit{machine}$ learning also take inspiration from $\textit{human}$ learning by considering use cases where machine learning systems have access to approximately the same number of words experienced by a 13 year old child (100M words). We investigate the role of 3 primary variables in a limited data regime as part of the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge. We contrast: (i) curriculum learning, (ii), pretraining (with text-only data), (iii) model type. We modulate these variables and assess them on two types of tasks: (a) multimodal (text+image), and (b) unimodal (text-only) tasks. We find that curriculum learning benefits multimodal evaluations over non-curriclum learning models, particularly when combining text-only pretraining. On text-only tasks, curriculum learning appears to help models with smaller trainable parameter counts. We suggest possible reasons based on architectural differences and training designs as to why one might observe such results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce an all-optical system, termed the "lying mirror", to hide input information by transforming it into misleading, ordinary-looking patterns that effectively camouflage the underlying image data and deceive the observers. This misleading transformation is achieved through passive light-matter interactions of the incident light with an optimized structured diffractive surface, enabling the optical concealment of any form of secret input data without any digital computing. These lying mirror designs were shown to camouflage different types of input image data, exhibiting robustness against a range of adversarial manipulations, including random image noise as well as unknown, random rotations, shifts, and scaling of the object features. The feasibility of the lying mirror concept was also validated experimentally using a structured micro-mirror array along with multi-wavelength illumination at 480, 550 and 600 nm, covering the blue, green and red image channels. This framework showcases the power of structured diffractive surfaces for visual information processing and might find various applications in defense, security and entertainment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are receiving increasing attention for their ability to enable robots to perform complex tasks by integrating visual context with linguistic commands. However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory.

By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distracted driving is a critical safety issue that leads to numerous fatalities and injuries worldwide. This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and real-time machine learning models to detect distracted driving behaviors. Leveraging the Pretrained YOLOv8 (P-YOLOv8) model, a real-time object detection system is introduced, optimized for both speed and accuracy. This approach addresses the computational constraints and latency limitations commonly associated with conventional detection models. The study demonstrates P-YOLOv8 versatility in both object detection and image classification tasks using the Distracted Driver Detection dataset from State Farm, which includes 22,424 images across ten behavior categories. Our research explores the application of P-YOLOv8 for image classification, evaluating its performance compared to deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet. Some traditional models often struggle with low accuracy, while others achieve high accuracy but come with high computational costs and slow detection speeds, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. P-YOLOv8 addresses these issues by achieving competitive accuracy with significant computational cost and efficiency advantages. In particular, P-YOLOv8 generates a lightweight model with a size of only 2.84 MB and a lower number of parameters, totaling 1,451,098, due to its innovative architecture. It achieves a high accuracy of 99.46 percent with this small model size, opening new directions for deployment on inexpensive and small embedded devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). The experimental results show robust performance, making P-YOLOv8 a cost-effective solution for real-time deployment. This study provides a detailed analysis of P-YOLOv8's architecture, training, and performance benchmarks, highlighting its potential for real-time use in detecting distracted driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) vessels is critical to connecting major circulations of the brain. The topology of the vascular structure is clinical significance to evaluate the risk, severity of the neuro-vascular diseases. The CoW has two representative angiographic imaging modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). TopCow24 provided 125 paired CTA-MRA dataset for the analysis of CoW. To explore both CTA and MRA images in a unified framework to learn the inherent topology of Cow, we construct the universal dataset via independent intensity preprocess, followed by joint resampling and normarlization. Then, we utilize the topology-aware loss to enhance the topology completeness of the CoW and the discrimination between different classes. A complementary topology-aware refinement is further conducted to enhance the connectivity within the same class. Our method was evaluated on all the three tasks and two modalities, achieving competitive results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Bui, Long Vuong, Khanh Doan, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, Dinh Phung</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Ghosh, Arun Sharma, Jayant Gupta, Aneesh Subramanian, Shashi Shekhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Abdullah, Ameer Hamza, Seong Tae Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical report generation is the task of automatically writing radiology reports for chest X-ray images. Manually composing these reports is a time-consuming process that is also prone to human errors. Generating medical reports can therefore help reduce the burden on radiologists. In other words, we can promote greater clinical automation in the medical domain. In this work, we propose a new framework leveraging vision-enabled Large Language Models (LLM) for the task of medical report generation. We introduce a lightweight solution that achieves better or comparative performance as compared to previous solutions on the task of medical report generation. We conduct extensive experiments exploring different model sizes and enhancement approaches, such as prefix tuning to improve the text generation abilities of the LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a prominent large-scale radiology report dataset - MIMIC-CXR. Our results demonstrate the capability of our resource-efficient framework to generate patient-specific reports with strong medical contextual understanding and high precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daehwan Kim, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are not well-calibrated and produce over-confident predictions. The miscalibration issue primarily stems from the minimization of cross-entropy, which aims to align predicted softmax probabilities with one-hot labels. In ordinal regression tasks, this problem is compounded by an additional challenge: the expectation that softmax probabilities should exhibit unimodal distribution is not met with cross-entropy. Rather, the ordinal regression literature has focused on unimodality and overlooked calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel loss function that introduces order-aware calibration, ensuring that prediction confidence adheres to ordinal relationships between classes. It incorporates soft ordinal encoding and label-smoothing-based regularization to enforce both calibration and unimodality. Extensive experiments across three popular ordinal regression benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art calibration without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilpa Choudhary, Sandeep Kumar, Pammi Sri Siddhaarth, Guntu Charitasri</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient detection and classification of blood cells are vital for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of blood disorders. This study utilizes a YOLOv10 model trained on Roboflow data with images resized to 640x640 pixels across varying epochs. The results show that increased training epochs significantly enhance accuracy, precision, and recall, particularly in real-time blood cell detection & classification. The YOLOv10 model outperforms MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet in real-time performance, though MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 are more computationally efficient, and DarkNet excels in feature extraction for blood cell classification. This research highlights the potential of integrating deep learning models like YOLOv10, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet into clinical workflows, promising improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, a new, well-annotated blood cell dataset was created and will be open-sourced to support further advancements in automatic blood cell detection and classification. The findings demonstrate the transformative impact of these models in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and enhancing blood disorder management</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqian Cheng, Roberto Manduchi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present PALMS, an innovative indoor global localization and relocalization system for mobile smartphones that utilizes publicly available floor plans. Unlike most vision-based methods that require constant visual input, our system adopts a dynamic form of localization that considers a single instantaneous observation and odometry data. The core contribution of this work is the introduction of a particle filter initialization method that leverages the Certainly Empty Space (CES) constraint along with principal orientation matching. This approach creates a spatial probability distribution of the device's location, significantly improving localization accuracy and reducing particle filter convergence time. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that PALMS outperforms traditional methods with uniformly initialized particle filters, providing a more efficient and accessible approach to indoor wayfinding. By eliminating the need for prior environmental fingerprinting, PALMS provides a scalable and practical approach to indoor navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Sun, Huimin Wang, Jiahao Zhan, Fan Nie, Xin Wen, Leimeng Xu, Kun Zhan, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Hang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large real-world driving datasets have sparked significant research into various aspects of data-driven motion planners for autonomous driving. These include data augmentation, model architecture, reward design, training strategies, and planner pipelines. These planners promise better generalizations on complicated and few-shot cases than previous methods. However, experiment results show that many of these approaches produce limited generalization abilities in planning performance due to overly complex designs or training paradigms. In this paper, we review and benchmark previous methods focusing on generalizations. The experimental results indicate that as models are appropriately scaled, many design elements become redundant. We introduce StateTransformer-2 (STR2), a scalable, decoder-only motion planner that uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) causal Transformer architecture. The MoE backbone addresses modality collapse and reward balancing by expert routing during training. Extensive experiments on the NuPlan dataset show that our method generalizes better than previous approaches across different test sets and closed-loop simulations. Furthermore, we assess its scalability on billions of real-world urban driving scenarios, demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements as both data and model size grow.</p>

<p>Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework for safe and autonomous aerial physical interaction in industrial settings. It comprises two main components: a neural network-based target detection system enhanced with edge computing for reduced onboard computational load, and a control barrier function (CBF)-based controller for safe and precise maneuvering. The target detection system is trained on a dataset under challenging visual conditions and evaluated for accuracy across various unseen data with changing lighting conditions. Depth features are utilized for target pose estimation, with the entire detection framework offloaded into low-latency edge computing. The CBF-based controller enables the UAV to converge safely to the target for precise contact. Simulated evaluations of both the controller and target detection are presented, alongside an analysis of real-world detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadjad Rezvani, Mansoor Fateh, Yeganeh Jalali, Amirreza Fateh</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it increases the chances of successful treatment. Automatic lung image segmentation assists doctors in identifying diseases such as lung cancer, COVID-19, and respiratory disorders. However, lung segmentation is challenging due to overlapping features like vascular and bronchial structures, along with pixel-level fusion of brightness, color, and texture. New lung segmentation methods face difficulties in identifying long-range relationships between image components, reliance on convolution operations that may not capture all critical features, and the complex structures of the lungs. Furthermore, semantic gaps between feature maps can hinder the integration of relevant information, reducing model accuracy. Skip connections can also limit the decoder's access to complete information, resulting in partial information loss during encoding. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach using the FusionLungNet network, which has a multi-level structure with key components, including the ResNet-50 encoder, Channel-wise Aggregation Attention (CAA) module, Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, self refinement (SR) module, and multiple decoders. The refinement sub-network uses convolutional neural networks for image post-processing to improve quality. Our method employs a combination of loss functions, including SSIM, IOU, and focal loss, to optimize image reconstruction quality. We created and publicly released a new dataset for lung segmentation called LungSegDB, including 1800 CT images from the LIDC-IDRI dataset (dataset version 1) and 700 images from the Chest CT Cancer Images from Kaggle dataset (dataset version 2). Our method achieved an IOU score of 98.04, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. https://github.com/sadjadrz/FusionLungNet</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting the behavior of road users accurately is crucial to enable the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in urban or densely populated areas. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in time series motion prediction research, leading to significant advancements in state-of-the-art techniques in recent years. However, the potential of using LiDAR data to capture more detailed local features, such as a person's gaze or posture, remains largely unexplored. To address this, we develop a novel multimodal approach for motion prediction based on the PointNet foundation model architecture, incorporating local LiDAR features. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset shows a performance improvement of 6.20% and 1.58% in minADE and mAP respectively, when integrated and compared with the previous state-of-the-art MTR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, David G. Beiser, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for low-cost, scalable approaches to measuring contactless vital signs, either during initial triage at a healthcare facility or virtual telemedicine visits. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can accurately estimate heart rate (HR) when applied to close-up videos of healthy volunteers in well-lit laboratory settings. However, results from such highly optimized laboratory studies may not be readily translated to healthcare settings. One significant barrier to the practical application of rPPG in health care is the accurate localization of the region of interest (ROI). Clinical or telemedicine visits may involve sub-optimal lighting, movement artifacts, variable camera angle, and subject distance. This paper presents an rPPG ROI selection method based on 3D facial landmarks and patient head yaw angle. We then demonstrate the robustness of this ROI selection method when coupled to the Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) rPPG method when applied to videos of patients presenting to an Emergency Department for respiratory complaints. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of rPPG in a challenging clinical environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Hu, Hanchi Ren, Jingjing Deng, Xianghua Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly deployed in dynamic, data-rich environments for applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance. These scenarios demand efficient data processing while maintaining privacy and security, making Federated Learning (FL) a promising solution. FL allows UAVs to collaboratively train global models without sharing raw data, but challenges arise due to the non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of the data collected by UAVs. In this study, we show an integration of the state-of-the-art FL methods to UAV Swarm application and invetigate the performance of multiple aggregation methods (namely FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and MOON) with a particular focus on tackling non-IID on a variety of datasets, specifically MNIST for baseline performance, CIFAR10 for natural object classification, EuroSAT for environment monitoring, and CelebA for surveillance. These algorithms were selected to cover improved techniques on both client-side updates and global aggregation. Results show that while all algorithms perform comparably on IID data, their performance deteriorates significantly under non-IID conditions. FedProx demonstrated the most stable overall performance, emphasising the importance of regularising local updates in non-IID environments to mitigate drastic deviations in local models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present TexPro, a novel method for high-fidelity material generation for input 3D meshes given text prompts. Unlike existing text-conditioned texture generation methods that typically generate RGB textures with baked lighting, TexPro is able to produce diverse texture maps via procedural material modeling, which enables physical-based rendering, relighting, and additional benefits inherent to procedural materials. Specifically, we first generate multi-view reference images given the input textual prompt by employing the latest text-to-image model. We then derive texture maps through a rendering-based optimization with recent differentiable procedural materials. To this end, we design several techniques to handle the misalignment between the generated multi-view images and 3D meshes, and introduce a novel material agent that enhances material classification and matching by exploring both part-level understanding and object-aware material reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing SOTAs and its capability of relighting.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diagnosis of glaucoma plays a critical role in the management and treatment of this vision-threatening disease. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause blindness by damaging the optic nerve at the back of the eye. Often called "silent thief of sight", it exhibits no symptoms during the early stages. Therefore, early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL) techniques, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems have emerged as promising tools to assist clinicians in accurately diagnosing glaucoma early. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI techniques utilized in CADx systems for glaucoma diagnosis. Through a detailed analysis of current literature, we identify key gaps and challenges in these systems, emphasizing the need for improved safety, reliability, interpretability, and explainability. By identifying research gaps, we aim to advance the field of CADx systems especially for the early diagnosis of glaucoma, in order to prevent any potential loss of vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large visual-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict discretized or continuous actions by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate Diffusion Transformer Policy pretrained on diverse robot data can generalize to different embodiments, including simulation environments like Maniskill2 and Calvin, as well as the real-world Franka arm. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin novel task setting (ABC->D), improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2.

<p>Abstract: Automating the theory-experiment cycle requires effective distributed workflows that utilize a computing continuum spanning lab instruments, edge sensors, computing resources at multiple facilities, data sets distributed across multiple information sources, and potentially cloud. Unfortunately, the obvious methods for constructing continuum platforms, orchestrating workflow tasks, and curating datasets over time fail to achieve scientific requirements for performance, energy, security, and reliability. Furthermore, achieving the best use of continuum resources depends upon the efficient composition and execution of workflow tasks, i.e., combinations of numerical solvers, data analytics, and machine learning. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's LDRD "Cloud, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Edge for Science and Security" (CHESS) has developed a set of interrelated capabilities for enabling distributed scientific workflows and curating datasets.

<p>Abstract: Solar flare forecasting mainly relies on photospheric magnetograms and associated physical features to predict forthcoming flares. However, it is believed that flare initiation mechanisms often originate in the chromosphere and the lower corona. In this study, we employ deep learning as a purely data-driven approach to compare the predictive capabilities of chromospheric and coronal UV and EUV emissions across different wavelengths with those of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Our findings indicate that individual EUV wavelengths can provide discriminatory power comparable or better to that of line-of-sight magnetograms. Moreover, we identify simple multimodal neural network architectures that consistently outperform single-input models, showing complementarity between the flare precursors that can be extracted from the distinct layers of the solar atmosphere. To mitigate potential biases from known misattributions in Active Region flare catalogs, our models are trained and evaluated using full-disk images and a comprehensive flare event catalog at the full-disk level. We introduce a deep-learning architecture suited for extracting temporal features from full-disk videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Parth Shirish Bhore, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pediatric pneumonia remains a significant global threat, posing a larger mortality risk than any other communicable disease. According to UNICEF, it is a leading cause of mortality in children under five and requires prompt diagnosis. Early diagnosis using chest radiographs is the prevalent standard, but limitations include low radiation levels in unprocessed images and data imbalance issues. This necessitates the development of efficient, computer-aided diagnosis techniques. To this end, we propose a novel EXplainable Contrastive-based Dilated Convolutional Network with Transformer (XCCNet) for pediatric pneumonia detection. XCCNet harnesses the spatial power of dilated convolutions and the global insights from contrastive-based transformers for effective feature refinement. A robust chest X-ray processing module tackles low-intensity radiographs, while adversarial-based data augmentation mitigates the skewed distribution of chest X-rays in the dataset. Furthermore, we actively integrate an explainability approach through feature visualization, directly aligning it with the attention region that pinpoints the presence of pneumonia or normality in radiographs. The efficacy of XCCNet is comprehensively assessed on four publicly available datasets. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of XCCNet compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin He, Jingyu Hu, Qinliang Lin, Cheng Luo, Weicheng Xie, Siyang Song, Muhammad Haris Khan, Linlin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization methods aim to learn transferable knowledge from source domains that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Recent studies show that neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learning behavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely as frequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poor generalization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniques successfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply more frequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalization improvement. In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior of applying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given the theoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on different spatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequency properties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency components could be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in the Fourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominant and highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbating the over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application of frequency shortcuts. To this end, we propose two effective data augmentation modules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequency characteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learning behavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcut learning.

This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Sapkota</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks of varying architectures are generally paired with affine transformation at the core. However, we find dot product neurons with global influence less interpretable as compared to local influence of euclidean distance (as used in Radial Basis Function Network). In this work, we explore the generalization of dot product neurons to $l^p$-norm, metrics, and beyond. We find that metrics as transform performs similarly to affine transform when used in MultiLayer Perceptron or Convolutional Neural Network. Moreover, we explore various properties of Metrics, compare it with Affine, and present multiple cases where metrics seem to provide better interpretability. We develop an interpretable local dictionary based Neural Networks and use it to understand and reject adversarial examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruohong Zhang, Bowen Zhang, Yanghao Li, Haotian Zhang, Zhiqing Sun, Zhe Gan, Yinfei Yang, Ruoming Pang, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) is crucial for improving interpretability and trustworthiness. However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, we propose a two-fold approach. First, we distill rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, we construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating detailed rationales in training and leveraging reinforcement learning to strengthen the reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prevailing wisdom asserts that one cannot rely on the cloud for critical real-time control systems like self-driving cars. We argue that we can, and must. Following the trends of increasing model sizes, improvements in hardware, and evolving mobile networks, we identify an opportunity to offload parts of time-sensitive and latency-critical compute to the cloud. Doing so requires carefully allocating bandwidth to meet strict latency SLOs, while maximizing benefit to the car.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a deep radiomics model for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa, grade group >= 2) detection and compare its performance to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) assessment in a multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed biparametric (T2W and DW) prostate MRI sequences of 615 patients (mean age, 63.1 +/- 7 years) from four datasets acquired between 2010 and 2020: PROSTATEx challenge, Prostate158 challenge, PCaMAP trial, and an in-house (NTNU/St. Olavs Hospital) dataset. With expert annotations as ground truth, a deep radiomics model was trained, including nnU-Net segmentation of the prostate gland, voxel-wise radiomic feature extraction, extreme gradient boost classification, and post-processing of tumor probability maps into csPCa detection maps. Training involved 5-fold cross-validation using the PROSTATEx (n=199), Prostate158 (n=138), and PCaMAP (n=78) datasets, and testing on the in-house (n=200) dataset. Patient- and lesion-level performance were compared to PI-RADS using area under ROC curve (AUROC [95% CI]), sensitivity, and specificity analysis. Results: On the test data, the radiologist achieved a patient-level AUROC of 0.94 [0.91-0.98] with 94% (75/80) sensitivity and 77% (92/120) specificity at PI-RADS >= 3. The deep radiomics model at a tumor probability cut-off >= 0.76 achieved 0.91 [0.86-0.95] AUROC with 90% (72/80) sensitivity and 73% (87/120) specificity, not significantly different (p = 0.068) from PI-RADS. On the lesion level, PI-RADS cut-off >= 3 had 84% (91/108) sensitivity at 0.2 (40/200) false positives per patient, while deep radiomics attained 68% (73/108) sensitivity at the same false positive rate. Conclusion: Deep radiomics machine learning model achieved comparable performance to PI-RADS assessment in csPCa detection at the patient-level but not at the lesion-level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samrajya Thapa, Koushik Howlader, Subhankar Bhattacharjee, Wei le</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Modal Contrastive Pre-training Framework that synergistically combines X-rays, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and radiology/cardiology reports. Our approach leverages transformers to encode these diverse modalities into a unified representation space, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate comprehensive patient assessments. We utilize LoRA-Peft to significantly reduce trainable parameters in the LLM and incorporate recent linear attention dropping strategy in the Vision Transformer(ViT) for smoother attention. Furthermore, we provide novel multimodal attention explanations and retrieval for our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an integrated model that combines X-ray, ECG, and Radiology/Cardiology Report with this approach. By utilizing contrastive loss, MoRE effectively aligns modality-specific features into a coherent embedding, which supports various downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification and multimodal retrieval. Employing our proposed methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Mimic-IV, CheXpert, Edema Severity, and PtbXl downstream datasets, surpassing existing multimodal approaches. Our proposed framework shows significant improvements in capturing intricate inter-modal relationships and its robustness in medical diagnosis that establishes a framework for future research in multimodal learning in the healthcare sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olcay Kursun, Ahmad Patooghy, Peyman Poursani, Oleg V. Favorov</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextually Guided Convolutional Neural Networks (CG-CNNs) employ self-supervision and contextual information to develop transferable features across diverse domains, including visual, tactile, temporal, and textual data. This work showcases the adaptability of CG-CNNs through applications to various datasets such as Caltech and Brodatz textures, the VibTac-12 tactile dataset, hyperspectral images, and challenges like the XOR problem and text analysis. In text analysis, CG-CNN employs an innovative embedding strategy that utilizes the context of neighboring words for classification, while in visual and signal data, it enhances feature extraction by exploiting spatial information. CG-CNN mimics the context-guided unsupervised learning mechanisms of biological neural networks and it can be trained to learn its features on limited-size datasets. Our experimental results on natural images reveal that CG-CNN outperforms comparable first-layer features of well-known deep networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet in terms of transferability and classification accuracy. In text analysis, CG-CNN learns word embeddings that outperform traditional models like Word2Vec in tasks such as the 20 Newsgroups text classification. Furthermore, ongoing development involves training CG-CNN on outputs from another CG-CNN to explore multi-layered architectures, aiming to construct more complex and descriptive features. This scalability and adaptability to various data types underscore the potential of CG-CNN to handle a wide range of applications, making it a promising architecture for tackling diverse data representation challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep generative vision models are now able to synthesize realistic-looking satellite imagery. But, the possibility of hallucinations prevents their adoption for risk-sensitive applications, such as generating materials for communicating climate change. To demonstrate this issue, we train a generative adversarial network (pix2pixHD) to create synthetic satellite imagery of future flooding and reforestation events. We find that a pure deep learning-based model can generate photorealistic flood visualizations but hallucinates floods at locations that were not susceptible to flooding. To address this issue, we propose to condition and evaluate generative vision models on segmentation maps of physics-based flood models. We show that our physics-conditioned model outperforms the pure deep learning-based model and a handcrafted baseline. We evaluate the generalization capability of our method to different remote sensing data and different climate-related events (reforestation). We publish our code and dataset which includes the data for a third case study of melting Arctic sea ice and $>$30,000 labeled HD image triplets -- or the equivalent of 5.5 million images at 128x128 pixels -- for segmentation guided image-to-image translation in Earth observation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guozheng Ma, Zhen Wang, Zhecheng Yuan, Xueqian Wang, Bo Yuan, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL), which makes decisions directly from high-dimensional visual inputs, has demonstrated significant potential in various domains. However, deploying visual RL techniques in the real world remains challenging due to their low sample efficiency and large generalization gaps. To tackle these obstacles, data augmentation (DA) has become a widely used technique in visual RL for acquiring sample-efficient and generalizable policies by diversifying the training data. This survey aims to provide a timely and essential review of DA techniques in visual RL in recognition of the thriving development in this field. In particular, we propose a unified framework for analyzing visual RL and understanding the role of DA in it. We then present a principled taxonomy of the existing augmentation techniques used in visual RL and conduct an in-depth discussion on how to better leverage augmented data in different scenarios. Moreover, we report a systematic empirical evaluation of DA-based techniques in visual RL and conclude by highlighting the directions for future research. As the first comprehensive survey of DA in visual RL, this work is expected to offer valuable guidance to this emerging field.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11571">SLLEN: Semantic-aware Low-light Image Enhancement Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingye Ju, Chuheng Chen, Charles A. Guo, Jinshan Pan, Jinhui Tang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: How to effectively explore semantic feature is vital for low-light image enhancement (LLE). Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agniva Sengupta, Adrien Bartoli</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensible objects form a challenging case for NRSfM, owing to the lack of a sufficiently constrained extensible model of the point-cloud. We tackle the challenge by proposing 1) convex relaxations of the isometric model up to quasi-isometry, and 2) convex relaxations involving the equiareal deformation model, which preserves local area and has not been used in NRSfM. The equiareal model is appealing because it is physically plausible and widely applicable. However, it has two main difficulties: first, when used on its own, it is ambiguous, and second, it involves quartic, hence highly nonconvex, constraints. Our approach handles the first difficulty by mixing the equiareal with the isometric model and the second difficulty by new convex relaxations. We validate our methods on multiple real and synthetic data, including well-known benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep networks have achieved impressive results on a range of well-curated benchmark datasets. Surprisingly, their performance remains sensitive to perturbations that have little effect on human performance. In this work, we propose a novel extension of Mixup called Robustmix that regularizes networks to classify based on lower-frequency spatial features. We show that this type of regularization improves robustness on a range of benchmarks such as Imagenet-C and Stylized Imagenet. It adds little computational overhead and, furthermore, does not require a priori knowledge of a large set of image transformations. We find that this approach further complements recent advances in model architecture and data augmentation, attaining a state-of-the-art mCE of 44.8 with an EfficientNet-B8 model and RandAugment, which is a reduction of 16 mCE compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Wei, Rujiao Yan, Matthias Schreier</p>
<p>Abstract: To implement autonomous driving, one essential step is to model the vehicle environment based on the sensor inputs. Radars, with their well-known advantages, became a popular option to infer the occupancy state of grid cells surrounding the vehicle. To tackle data sparsity and noise of radar detections, we propose a deep learning-based Inverse Sensor Model (ISM) to learn the mapping from sparse radar detections to polar measurement grids. Improved lidar-based measurement grids are used as reference. The learned radar measurement grids, combined with radar Doppler velocity measurements, are further used to generate a Dynamic Grid Map (DGM). Experiments in real-world highway scenarios show that our approach outperforms the hand-crafted geometric ISMs. In comparison to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, our approach is the first one to learn a single-frame measurement grid in the polar scheme from radars with a limited Field Of View (FOV). The learning framework makes the learned ISM independent of the radar mounting. This enables us to flexibly use one or more radar sensors without network retraining and without requirements on 360{\deg} sensor coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Przewi\k{e}\'zlikowski, Mateusz Pyla, Bartosz Zieli\'nski, Bart{\l}omiej Twardowski, Jacek Tabor, Marek \'Smieja</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful technique for learning from unlabeled data. By learning to remain invariant to applied data augmentations, methods such as SimCLR and MoCo can reach quality on par with supervised approaches. However, this invariance may be detrimental for solving downstream tasks that depend on traits affected by augmentations used during pretraining, such as color. In this paper, we propose to foster sensitivity to such characteristics in the representation space by modifying the projector network, a common component of self-supervised architectures. Specifically, we supplement the projector with information about augmentations applied to images. For the projector to take advantage of this auxiliary conditioning when solving the SSL task, the feature extractor learns to preserve the augmentation information in its representations. Our approach, coined Conditional Augmentation-aware Self-supervised Learning (CASSLE), is directly applicable to typical joint-embedding SSL methods regardless of their objective functions. Moreover, it does not require major changes in the network architecture or prior knowledge of downstream tasks. In addition to an analysis of sensitivity towards different data augmentations, we conduct a series of experiments, which show that CASSLE improves over various SSL methods, reaching state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently attracted the interest of many researchers, and inverting the diffusion process can play an important role in better understanding the generative process and how to engineer prompts in order to obtain the desired images. To this end, we study the task of predicting the prompt embedding given an image generated by a generative diffusion model. We consider a series of white-box and black-box models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned). We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. In addition, we make an interesting discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts, when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.

SignDiff has a novel Frame Reinforcement Network called FR-Net, similar to dense human pose estimation work, which enhances the correspondence between text lexical symbols and sign language dense pose frames, reduces the occurrence of multiple fingers in the diffusion model. In addition, we propose a new method for American Sign Language Production (ASLP), which can generate ASL skeletal pose videos from text input, integrating two new improved modules and a new loss function to improve the accuracy and quality of sign language skeletal posture and enhance the ability of the model to train on large-scale data. We propose the first baseline for ASL production and report the scores of 17.19 and 12.85 on BLEU-4 on the How2Sign dev/test sets. We evaluated our model on the previous mainstream dataset PHOENIX14T, and our method achieved the SOTA results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanmin Yang, Hui Guo, Shu Hu, Bin Zhu, Ying Fu, Siwei Lyu, Xi Wu, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake technology poses a significant threat to security and social trust. Although existing detection methods have shown high performance in identifying forgeries within datasets that use the same deepfake techniques for both training and testing, they suffer from sharp performance degradation when faced with cross-dataset scenarios where unseen deepfake techniques are tested. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Information Decomposition (DID) framework to enhance the performance of Cross-dataset Deepfake Detection (CrossDF). Unlike most existing deepfake detection methods, our framework prioritizes high-level semantic features over specific visual artifacts. Specifically, it adaptively decomposes facial features into deepfake-related and irrelevant information, only using the intrinsic deepfake-related information for real/fake discrimination. Moreover, it optimizes these two kinds of information to be independent with a de-correlation learning module, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against various irrelevant information changes and generalization ability to unseen forgery methods. Our extensive experimental evaluation and comparison with existing state-of-the-art detection methods validate the effectiveness and superiority of the DID framework on cross-dataset deepfake detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved substantial progress in multimodal perception and reasoning. When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyasi Pathak, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Jeroen Geerdink, Jeroen Veltman, Maurice van Keulen, Nicola Strisciuglio, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer prediction models for mammography assume that annotations are available for individual images or regions of interest (ROIs), and that there is a fixed number of images per patient. These assumptions do not hold in real hospital settings, where clinicians provide only a final diagnosis for the entire mammography exam (case). Since data in real hospital settings scales with continuous patient intake, while manual annotation efforts do not, we develop a framework for case-level breast cancer prediction that does not require any manual annotation and can be trained with case labels readily available at the hospital. Specifically, we propose a two-level multi-instance learning (MIL) approach at patch and image level for case-level breast cancer prediction and evaluate it on two public and one private dataset. We propose a novel domain-specific MIL pooling observing that breast cancer may or may not occur in both sides, while images of both breasts are taken as a precaution during mammography. We propose a dynamic training procedure for training our MIL framework on a variable number of images per case. We show that our two-level MIL model can be applied in real hospital settings where only case labels, and a variable number of images per case are available, without any loss in performance compared to models trained on image labels. Only trained with weak (case-level) labels, it has the capability to point out in which breast side, mammography view and view region the abnormality lies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jon Alvarez Justo, Alexandru Ghita, Daniel Kovac, Joseph L. Garrett, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Jesus Gonzalez-Llorente, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Tor Arne Johansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellites are increasingly adopting on-board AI to optimize operations and increase autonomy through in-orbit inference. The use of Deep Learning (DL) models for segmentation in hyperspectral imagery offers advantages for remote sensing applications. In this work, we train and test 20 models for multi-class segmentation in hyperspectral imagery, selected for their potential in future space deployment. These models include 1D and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the latest vision transformers (ViTs). We propose a lightweight 1D-CNN model, 1D-Justo-LiuNet, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in the hypespectral domain. 1D-Justo-LiuNet exceeds the performance of 2D-CNN UNets and outperforms Apple's lightweight vision transformers designed for mobile inference. 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy (0.93) with the smallest model size (4,563 parameters) among all tested models, while maintaining fast inference. Unlike 2D-CNNs and ViTs, which encode both spectral and spatial information, 1D-Justo-LiuNet focuses solely on the rich spectral features in hyperspectral data, benefitting from the high-dimensional feature space. Our findings are validated across various satellite datasets, with the HYPSO-1 mission serving as the primary case study for sea, land, and cloud segmentation. We further confirm our conclusions through generalization tests on other hyperspectral missions, such as NASA's EO-1. Based on its superior performance and compact size, we conclude that 1D-Justo-LiuNet is highly suitable for in-orbit deployment, providing an effective solution for optimizing and automating satellite operations at edge.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study performs comprehensive evaluation of four neural network architectures (UNet, SegResNet, DynUNet, and SwinUNETR) for lymphoma lesion segmentation from PET/CT images. These networks were trained, validated, and tested on a diverse, multi-institutional dataset of 611 cases. Internal testing (88 cases; total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) range [0.52, 2300] ml) showed SegResNet as the top performer with a median Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 and median false positive volume (FPV) of 4.55 ml; all networks had a median false negative volume (FNV) of 0 ml. On the unseen external test set (145 cases with TMTV range: [0.10, 2480] ml), SegResNet achieved the best median DSC of 0.68 and FPV of 21.46 ml, while UNet had the best FNV of 0.41 ml. We assessed reproducibility of six lesion measures, calculated their prediction errors, and examined DSC performance in relation to these lesion measures, offering insights into segmentation accuracy and clinical relevance. Additionally, we introduced three lesion detection criteria, addressing the clinical need for identifying lesions, counting them, and segmenting based on metabolic characteristics. We also performed expert intra-observer variability analysis revealing the challenges in segmenting ``easy'' vs. ``hard'' cases, to assist in the development of more resilient segmentation algorithms. Finally, we performed inter-observer agreement assessment underscoring the importance of a standardized ground truth segmentation protocol involving multiple expert annotators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Guo, Tao Dai, Yuanchao Bai, Bin Chen, Xudong Ren, Zexuan Zhu, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Wu, Junjun Jiang, Junpeng Jiang, Xianming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in single-image super-resolution (SISR) has achieved remarkable performance, yet the computational costs of these methods remain a challenge for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In particular, transformer-based methods, which leverage self-attention mechanisms, have led to significant breakthroughs but also introduce substantial computational costs. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Convolutional Transformer layer (ConvFormer) and propose a ConvFormer-based Super-Resolution network (CFSR), offering an effective and efficient solution for lightweight image super-resolution. The proposed method inherits the advantages of both convolution-based and transformer-based approaches. Specifically, CFSR utilizes large kernel convolutions as a feature mixer to replace the self-attention module, efficiently modeling long-range dependencies and extensive receptive fields with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose an edge-preserving feed-forward network (EFN) designed to achieve local feature aggregation while effectively preserving high-frequency information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFSR strikes an optimal balance between computational cost and performance compared to existing lightweight SR methods. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods such as ShuffleMixer, the proposed CFSR achieves a gain of 0.39 dB on the Urban100 dataset for the x2 super-resolution task while requiring 26\% and 31\% fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Gong, Zhun Zhong, Yansong Qu, Zhiming Luo, Rongrong Ji, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on three widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB, SYSU, and LLCM. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our method but also provide insights for future improvements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue-Jiang Dong, Fang-Lue Zhang, Song-Hai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth perception is crucial for a wide range of robotic applications. Multi-frame self-supervised depth estimation methods have gained research interest due to their ability to leverage large-scale, unlabeled real-world data. However, the self-supervised methods often rely on the assumption of a static scene and their performance tends to degrade in dynamic environments. To address this issue, we present Motion-Aware Loss, which leverages the temporal relation among consecutive input frames and a novel distillation scheme between the teacher and student networks in the multi-frame self-supervised depth estimation methods. Specifically, we associate the spatial locations of moving objects with the temporal order of input frames to eliminate errors induced by object motion. Meanwhile, we enhance the original distillation scheme in multi-frame methods to better exploit the knowledge from a teacher network. MAL is a novel, plug-and-play module designed for seamless integration into multi-frame self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods. Adding MAL into previous state-of-the-art methods leads to a reduction in depth estimation errors by up to 4.2% and 10.8% on KITTI and CityScapes benchmarks, respectively.</p>

Each cost volume is processed separately, and a coupling module is proposed to fuse the geometry information extracted from the upper and lower cost volumes. DCVSMNet is a fast stereo matching network with a 67 ms inference time and strong generalization ability which can produce competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results on several bench mark datasets show that DCVSMNet achieves better accuracy than methods such as CGI-Stereo and BGNet at the cost of greater inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunwei Bai, Ying Kiat Tan, Shiming Chen, Yao Shu, Tsuhan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot-learning (FSL) commonly requires a model to identify images (queries) that belong to classes unseen during training, based on a few labeled samples of the new classes (support set) as reference. So far, plenty of algorithms involve training data augmentation to improve the generalization capability of FSL models, but outlier queries or support images during inference can still pose great generalization challenges. In this work, to reduce the bias caused by the outlier samples, we generate additional test-class samples by combining original samples with suitable train-class samples via a generative image combiner. Then, we obtain averaged features via an augmentor, which leads to more typical representations through the averaging. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., obtaining a test accuracy improvement proportion of around 10% (e.g., from 46.86% to 53.28%) for trained FSL models. Importantly, given pretrained image combiner, our method is training-free for off-the-shelf FSL models, whose performance can be improved without extra datasets nor further training of the models themselves.</p>

However, the process by which the encoder produces the text representation is unknown. We propose the Diffusion Lens, a method for analyzing the text encoder of T2I models by generating images from its intermediate representations. Using the Diffusion Lens, we perform an extensive analysis of two recent T2I models. Exploring compound prompts, we find that complex scenes describing multiple objects are composed progressively and more slowly compared to simple scenes; Exploring knowledge retrieval, we find that representation of uncommon concepts requires further computation compared to common concepts, and that knowledge retrieval is gradual across layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the text encoder component in T2I pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Zhengkai Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Qiang Nie, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent success of vision foundation models have shown promising performance for the 2D perception tasks. However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to enhance the model robustness against domain shifts without accessing target domains. A prevalent category of methods for DG is data augmentation, which focuses on generating virtual samples to simulate domain shifts. However, existing augmentation techniques in DG are mainly tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with limited exploration in token-based architectures, i.e., vision transformer (ViT) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) models. In this paper, we study the impact of prior CNN-based augmentation methods on token-based models, revealing their performance is suboptimal due to the lack of incentivizing the model to learn holistic shape information. To tackle the issue, we propose the SEmantic-aware Token Augmentation (SETA) method. SETA transforms token features by perturbing local edge cues while preserving global shape features, thereby enhancing the model learning of shape information. To further enhance the generalization ability of the model, we introduce two stylized variants of our method combined with two state-of-the-art style augmentation methods in DG. We provide a theoretical insight into our method, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the generalization risk bound. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks prove that our method achieves SOTA performances across various ViT and MLP architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Luo, Xiaolong Chen, Xinghua Qu, Tianyang Hu, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, some works have tried to combine diffusion and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to alleviate the computational cost of the iterative denoising inference in Diffusion Models (DMs). However, existing works in this line suffer from either training instability and mode collapse or subpar one-step generation learning efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce YOSO, a novel generative model designed for rapid, scalable, and high-fidelity one-step image synthesis with high training stability and mode coverage. Specifically, we smooth the adversarial divergence by the denoising generator itself, performing self-cooperative learning. We show that our method can serve as a one-step generation model training from scratch with competitive performance. Moreover, we extend our YOSO to one-step text-to-image generation based on pre-trained models by several effective training techniques (i.e., latent perceptual loss and latent discriminator for efficient training along with the latent DMs; the informative prior initialization (IPI), and the quick adaption stage for fixing the flawed noise scheduler). Experimental results show that YOSO achieves the state-of-the-art one-step generation performance even with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. In particular, we show that the YOSO-PixArt-$\alpha$ can generate images in one step trained on 512 resolution, with the capability of adapting to 1024 resolution without extra explicit training, requiring only ~10 A800 days for fine-tuning.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in 3D modeling of articulated objects, with a specific focus on the task of articulated part perception and articulated object creation (reconstruction and generation). We systematically review and discuss the relevant literature from two perspectives: geometry modeling (i.e., structure and shape of articulated parts) and articulation modeling (i.e., dynamics and motion of parts). Through this survey, we highlight the substantial progress made in these areas, outline the ongoing challenges, and identify gaps for future research.

We introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection (UADA3D). UADA3D does not depend on pre-trained source models or teacher-student architectures. Instead, it uses an adversarial approach to directly learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate its efficacy in various adaptation scenarios, showing significant improvements in both self-driving car and mobile robot domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyi Shang, Amos You, Sanjay Subramanian, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in video question-answering (VideoQA) using a frame-wise approach by leveraging large-scale pretraining in a zero-shot manner. Nevertheless, these models need to be capable of finding relevant information, extracting it, and answering the question simultaneously. Currently, existing methods perform all of these steps in a single pass without being able to adapt if insufficient or incorrect information is collected. To overcome this, we introduce a modular multi-LMM agent framework based on several agents with different roles, instructed by a Planner agent that updates its instructions using shared feedback from the other agents. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a method that can create a plan to "Traverse" through the video, ask questions about individual frames to "Locate" and store key information, and then "Evaluate" if there is enough information to answer the question. Finally, if there is not enough information, our method is able to "Replan" based on its collected knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed TraveLER approach improves performance on several VideoQA benchmarks without the need to fine-tune on specific datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Nguyen H. Tran, Viet Dung Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond class frequency, we recognize the impact of class-wise relationships among various class-specific predictions and the imbalance in label masks on long-tailed segmentation learning. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Pixel-wise Adaptive Training (PAT) technique tailored for long-tailed segmentation. PAT has two key features: 1) class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization, and 2) pixel-wise class-specific loss adaptation (PCLA). First, the class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization helps alleviate the imbalance among label masks by ensuring equal consideration of the class-wise impact on model updates. Second, PCLA tackles the detrimental impact of both rare classes within the long-tailed distribution and inaccurate predictions from previous training stages by encouraging learning classes with low prediction confidence and guarding against forgetting classes with high confidence. This combined approach fosters robust learning while preventing the model from forgetting previously learned knowledge. PAT exhibits significant performance improvements, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 2.2% in the NyU dataset. Moreover, it enhances overall pixel-wise accuracy by 2.85% and intersection over union value by 2.07%, with a particularly notable declination of 0.39% in detecting rare classes compared to Balance Logits Variation, as demonstrated on the three popular datasets, i.e., OxfordPetIII, CityScape, and NYU.</p>

However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Ma, Min Hu, Pinghui Wang, Wangchun Sun, Lingyun Song, Hongbin Pei, Jun Liu, Youtian Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a complex multi-modal reasoning task, demanding intelligent systems to accurately respond to natural language queries based on audio-video input pairs. Nevertheless, prevalent AVQA approaches are prone to overlearning dataset biases, resulting in poor robustness. Furthermore, current datasets may not provide a precise diagnostic for these methods. To tackle these challenges, firstly, we propose a novel dataset, MUSIC-AVQA-R, crafted in two steps: rephrasing questions within the test split of a public dataset (MUSIC-AVQA) and subsequently introducing distribution shifts to split questions. The former leads to a large, diverse test space, while the latter results in a comprehensive robustness evaluation on rare, frequent, and overall questions. Secondly, we propose a robust architecture that utilizes a multifaceted cycle collaborative debiasing strategy to overcome bias learning. Experimental results show that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on MUSIC-AVQA-R, notably obtaining a significant improvement of 9.32%. Extensive ablation experiments are conducted on the two datasets mentioned to analyze the component effectiveness within the debiasing strategy. Additionally, we highlight the limited robustness of existing multi-modal QA methods through the evaluation on our dataset. We also conduct experiments combining various baselines with our proposed strategy on two datasets to verify its plug-and-play capability. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/reml-group/MUSIC-AVQA-R.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu Li, Xiangyong Cao, Yupeng Deng, Jiayi Song, Junmin Liu, Deyu Meng, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Change Detection (CD) aims to identify pixels with semantic changes between images. However, annotating massive numbers of pixel-level images is labor-intensive and costly, especially for multi-temporal images, which require pixel-wise comparisons by human experts. Considering the excellent performance of visual language models (VLMs) for zero-shot, open-vocabulary, etc. with prompt-based reasoning, it is promising to utilize VLMs to make better CD under limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a VLM guidance-based semi-supervised CD method, namely SemiCD-VL. The insight of SemiCD-VL is to synthesize free change labels using VLMs to provide additional supervision signals for unlabeled data. However, almost all current VLMs are designed for single-temporal images and cannot be directly applied to bi- or multi-temporal images. Motivated by this, we first propose a VLM-based mixed change event generation (CEG) strategy to yield pseudo labels for unlabeled CD data. Since the additional supervised signals provided by these VLM-driven pseudo labels may conflict with the pseudo labels from the consistency regularization paradigm (e.g. FixMatch), we propose the dual projection head for de-entangling different signal sources. Further, we explicitly decouple the bi-temporal images semantic representation through two auxiliary segmentation decoders, which are also guided by VLM. Finally, to make the model more adequately capture change representations, we introduce metric-aware supervision by feature-level contrastive loss in auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments show the advantage of SemiCD-VL. For instance, SemiCD-VL improves the FixMatch baseline by +5.3 IoU on WHU-CD and by +2.4 IoU on LEVIR-CD with 5% labels. In addition, our CEG strategy, in an un-supervised manner, can achieve performance far superior to state-of-the-art un-supervised CD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current datasets for long-form video understanding often fall short of providing genuine long-form comprehension challenges, as many tasks derived from these datasets can be successfully tackled by analyzing just one or a few random frames from a video. To address this issue, we present a novel dataset and benchmark, CinePile, specifically designed for authentic long-form video understanding. This paper details our innovative approach for creating a question-answer dataset, utilizing advanced LLMs with human-in-the-loop and building upon human-generated raw data. Our comprehensive dataset comprises 305,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), covering various visual and multimodal aspects, including temporal comprehension, understanding human-object interactions, and reasoning about events or actions within a scene. Additionally, we fine-tuned open-source Video-LLMs on the training split and evaluated both open-source and proprietary video-centric LLMs on the test split of our dataset. The findings indicate that although current models underperform compared to humans, fine-tuning these models can lead to significant improvements in their performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Pan, Muyuan Ma, Qing Ma, Cong Bai, Shengyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image-text retrieval constitutes a foundational aspect of remote sensing interpretation tasks, facilitating the alignment of vision and language representations. This paper introduces a prior instruction representation (PIR) learning paradigm that draws on prior knowledge to instruct adaptive learning of vision and text representations. Based on PIR, a domain-adapted remote sensing image-text retrieval framework PIR-ITR is designed to address semantic noise issues in vision-language understanding tasks. However, with massive additional data for pre-training the vision-language foundation model, remote sensing image-text retrieval is further developed into an open-domain retrieval task. Continuing with the above, we propose PIR-CLIP, a domain-specific CLIP-based framework for remote sensing image-text retrieval, to address semantic noise in remote sensing vision-language representations and further improve open-domain retrieval performance. In vision representation, we utilize the prior-guided knowledge of the remote sensing scene recognition by building a belief matrix to select key features for reducing the impact of semantic noise. In text representation, we use the previous time step to cyclically activate the current time step to enhance text representation capability. A cluster-wise Affiliation Loss (AL) is proposed to constrain the inter-classes and to reduce the semantic confusion zones in the common subspace. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PIR could enhance vision and text representations and outperform the state-of-the-art methods of closed-domain and open-domain retrieval on two benchmark datasets, RSICD and RSITMD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sami Arja, Alexandre Marcireau, Saeed Afshar, Bharath Ramesh, Gregory Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial surveillance demands rapid and precise detection of moving objects in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which draw inspiration from biological vision systems, present a promising alternative to frame-based sensors due to their exceptional temporal resolution, superior dynamic range, and minimal power requirements. Unlike traditional frame-based sensors that capture redundant information at fixed intervals, event cameras asynchronously record pixel-level brightness changes, providing a continuous and efficient data stream ideal for fast motion segmentation. While these sensors are ideal for fast motion segmentation, existing event-based motion segmentation methods often suffer from limitations such as the need for per-scene parameter tuning or reliance on manual labelling, hindering their scalability and practical deployment. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel motion segmentation method that leverages self-supervised vision transformers on both event data and optical flow information. Our approach eliminates the need for human annotations and reduces dependency on scene-specific parameters. In this paper, we used the EVK4-HD Prophesee event camera onboard a highly dynamic aerial platform in urban settings. We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework across multiple datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing benchmarks. Our method can effectively handle various types of motion and an arbitrary number of moving objects. Code and dataset are available at: \url{https://samiarja.github.io/evairborne/}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Luo, Austin Peng, Adithya Vasudev, Rishabh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Video is an increasingly prominent and information-dense medium, yet it poses substantial challenges for language models. A typical video consists of a sequence of shorter segments, or shots, that collectively form a coherent narrative. Each shot is analogous to a word in a sentence where multiple data streams of information (such as visual and auditory data) must be processed simultaneously. Comprehension of the entire video requires not only understanding the visual-audio information of each shot but also requires that the model links the ideas between each shot to generate a larger, all-encompassing story. Despite significant progress in the field, current works often overlook videos' more granular shot-by-shot semantic information. In this project, we propose a family of efficient large language vision models (LLVMs) to boost video summarization and captioning called Shotluck Holmes. By leveraging better pretraining and data collection strategies, we extend the abilities of existing small LLVMs from being able to understand a picture to being able to understand a sequence of frames. Specifically, we show that Shotluck Holmes achieves better performance than state-of-the-art results on the Shot2Story video captioning and summary task with significantly smaller and more computationally efficient models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Balasubramanian, Samyadeep Basu, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has explored how individual components of the CLIP-ViT model contribute to the final representation by leveraging the shared image-text representation space of CLIP. These components, such as attention heads and MLPs, have been shown to capture distinct image features like shape, color or texture. However, understanding the role of these components in arbitrary vision transformers (ViTs) is challenging. To this end, we introduce a general framework which can identify the roles of various components in ViTs beyond CLIP. Specifically, we (a) automate the decomposition of the final representation into contributions from different model components, and (b) linearly map these contributions to CLIP space to interpret them via text. Additionally, we introduce a novel scoring function to rank components by their importance with respect to specific features. Applying our framework to various ViT variants (e.g. DeiT, DINO, DINOv2, Swin, MaxViT), we gain insights into the roles of different components concerning particular image features. These insights facilitate applications such as image retrieval using text descriptions or reference images, visualizing token importance heatmaps, and mitigating spurious correlations. We release our code to reproduce the experiments at https://github.com/SriramB-98/vit-decompose</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an emerging technique with remarkable potential in 3D representation and image rendering. However, the substantial storage overhead of 3DGS significantly impedes its practical applications. In this work, we formulate the compact 3D Gaussian learning as an end-to-end Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) problem and propose RDO-Gaussian that can achieve flexible and continuous rate control. RDO-Gaussian addresses two main issues that exist in current schemes: 1) Different from prior endeavors that minimize the rate under the fixed distortion, we introduce dynamic pruning and entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) that optimize the rate and distortion at the same time. 2) Previous works treat the colors of each Gaussian equally, while we model the colors of different regions and materials with learnable numbers of parameters. We verify our method on both real and synthetic scenes, showcasing that RDO-Gaussian greatly reduces the size of 3D Gaussian over 40x, and surpasses existing methods in rate-distortion performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Peng, Wenbo Li, Renjing Pei, Jingjing Ren, Yang Wang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing image super-resolution (SR) techniques often fail to generalize effectively in complex real-world settings due to the significant divergence between training data and practical scenarios. To address this challenge, previous efforts have either manually simulated intricate physical-based degradations or utilized learning-based techniques, yet these approaches remain inadequate for producing large-scale, realistic, and diverse data simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel Realistic Decoupled Data Generator (RealDGen), an unsupervised learning data generation framework designed for real-world super-resolution. We meticulously develop content and degradation extraction strategies, which are integrated into a novel content-degradation decoupled diffusion model to create realistic low-resolution images from unpaired real LR and HR images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDGen excels in generating large-scale, high-quality paired data that mirrors real-world degradations, significantly advancing the performance of popular SR models on various real-world benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1, this version produces much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1) replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models built on Stable Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10x faster) and more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise annotations and diverse scenes to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix O'Mahony, Yulong Yang, Christine Allen-Blanchette</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce group convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) equivariant to color variation. GCNNs have been designed for a variety of geometric transformations from 2D and 3D rotation groups, to semi-groups such as scale. Despite the improved interpretability, accuracy and generalizability of these architectures, GCNNs have seen limited application in the context of perceptual quantities. Notably, the recent CEConv network uses a GCNN to achieve equivariance to hue transformations by convolving input images with a hue rotated RGB filter. However, this approach leads to invalid RGB values which break equivariance and degrade performance. We resolve these issues with a lifting layer that transforms the input image directly, thereby circumventing the issue of invalid RGB values and improving equivariance error by over three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we extend the notion of color equivariance to include equivariance to saturation shift. Our hue-, saturation-, and color-equivariant networks achieve strong generalization to out-of-distribution perceptual variations and improved sample efficiency over conventional architectures. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on synthetic and real world datasets where we consistently outperform competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aiwen Jiang, Zhi Wei, Long Peng, Feiqiang Liu, Wenbo Li, Mingwen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Trinh, Markus Heinonen, Luigi Acerbi, Samuel Kaski</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Wang, Jingyu Lin, Yifei Qian, Yi Huang, Shicen Tian, Bosong Chai, Juncan Deng, Qu Yang, Lan Du, Cunjian Chen, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in language-driven and layout-driven image generation. However, most diffusion models are limited to visible RGB image generation. In fact, human perception of the world is enriched by diverse viewpoints, such as chromatic contrast, thermal illumination, and depth information. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model for general layout-guided cross-modal generation, called DiffX. Notably, our DiffX presents a compact and effective cross-modal generative modeling pipeline, which conducts diffusion and denoising processes in the modality-shared latent space. Moreover, we introduce the Joint-Modality Embedder (JME) to enhance the interaction between layout and text conditions by incorporating a gated attention mechanism. To facilitate the user-instructed training, we construct the cross-modal image datasets with detailed text captions by the Large-Multimodal Model (LMM) and our human-in-the-loop refinement. Through extensive experiments, our DiffX demonstrates robustness in cross-modal ''RGB+X'' image generation on FLIR, MFNet, and COME15K datasets, guided by various layout conditions. Meanwhile, it shows the strong potential for the adaptive generation of ``RGB+X+Y(+Z)'' images or more diverse modalities on FLIR, MFNet, COME15K, and MCXFace datasets. To our knowledge, DiffX is the first model for layout-guided cross-modal image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan, Samuele Papa, Karl Henrik Johansson, Stefan Bauer, Andrea Dittadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric (OC) representations, which represent the state of a visual scene by modeling it as a composition of objects, have the potential to be used in various downstream tasks to achieve systematic compositional generalization and facilitate reasoning. However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models, especially for long video understanding. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models \qinghao{by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, {\em i.e.}, long context extension and long video supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 2048, improving the long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (out of 5), achieving 99.8% accuracy in 6,000-frame (more than 1 million tokens) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-7B demonstrates strong accuracy on the VideoMME benchmark, i.e., 61.8% with subtitle. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring style sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with a hybrid context and tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Han, Junyao Chen, Zhengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With diet and nutrition apps reaching 1.4 billion users in 2022 [1], it's not surprise that popular health apps, MyFitnessPal, Noom, and Calorie Counter, are surging in popularity. However, one major setback [2] of nearly all nutrition applications is that users must enter food data manually, which is time-consuming and tedious. Thus, there has been an increasing demand for applications that can accurately identify food items, analyze their nutritional content, and offer dietary recommendations in real-time. This paper introduces a comprehensive system that combines advanced computer vision techniques with nutritional analysis, implemented in a versatile mobile and web application. The system is divided into three key concepts: 1) food detection using the YOLOv8 model, 2) nutrient analysis via the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API, and 3) personalized meal recommendations using the Edamam Meal Planning and Recipe Search APIs. Preliminary results showcase the system's effectiveness by providing immediate, accurate dietary insights, with a demonstrated food recognition accuracy of nearly 80%, making it a valuable tool for users to make informed dietary decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enze Zhu, Zhan Chen, Dingkai Wang, Hanru Shi, Xiaoxuan Liu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images is vital in downstream applications such as land-cover mapping, urban planning and disaster assessment.Existing Transformer-based methods suffer from the constraint between accuracy and efficiency, while the recently proposed Mamba is renowned for being efficient. Therefore, to overcome the dilemma, we propose UNetMamba, a UNet-like semantic segmentation model based on Mamba. It incorporates a mamba segmentation decoder (MSD) that can efficiently decode the complex information within high-resolution images, and a local supervision module (LSM), which is train-only but can significantly enhance the perception of local contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNetMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with mIoU increased by 0.87% on LoveDA and 0.39% on ISPRS Vaihingen, while achieving high efficiency through the lightweight design, less memory footprint and reduced computational cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel E. Lima, Rayson Laroca, Eduardo Santos, Eduil Nascimento Jr., David Menotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle information recognition is crucial in various practical domains, particularly in criminal investigations. Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has garnered significant research interest because color is a visually distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors, and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR. Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of fine-grained vehicle classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Meier, Luca Scalerandi, Oussema Dhaouadi, Jacques Kaiser, Nikita Araslanov, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing techniques for monocular 3D detection have a serious restriction. They tend to perform well only on a limited set of benchmarks, faring well either on ego-centric car views or on traffic camera views, but rarely on both. To encourage progress, this work advocates for an extended evaluation of 3D detection frameworks across different camera perspectives. We make two key contributions. First, we introduce the CARLA Drone dataset, CDrone. Simulating drone views, it substantially expands the diversity of camera perspectives in existing benchmarks. Despite its synthetic nature, CDrone represents a real-world challenge. To show this, we confirm that previous techniques struggle to perform well both on CDrone and a real-world 3D drone dataset. Second, we develop an effective data augmentation pipeline called GroundMix. Its distinguishing element is the use of the ground for creating 3D-consistent augmentation of a training image. GroundMix significantly boosts the detection accuracy of a lightweight one-stage detector. In our expanded evaluation, we achieve the average precision on par with or substantially higher than the previous state of the art across all tested datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lintong Zhang, Yifu Tao, Jiarong Lin, Fu Zhang, Maurice Fallon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in mapping techniques have enabled the creation of highly accurate dense 3D maps during robotic missions, such as point clouds, meshes, or NeRF-based representations. These developments present new opportunities for reusing these maps for localization. However, there remains a lack of a unified approach that can operate seamlessly across different map representations. This paper presents and evaluates a global visual localization system capable of localizing a single camera image across various 3D map representations built using both visual and lidar sensing. Our system generates a database by synthesizing novel views of the scene, creating RGB and depth image pairs. Leveraging the precise 3D geometric map, our method automatically defines rendering poses, reducing the number of database images while preserving retrieval performance. To bridge the domain gap between real query camera images and synthetic database images, our approach utilizes learning-based descriptors and feature detectors. We evaluate the system's performance through extensive real-world experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings, assessing the effectiveness of each map representation and demonstrating its advantages over traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) localization approaches. The results show that all three map representations can achieve consistent localization success rates of 55% and higher across various environments. NeRF synthesized images show superior performance, localizing query images at an average success rate of 72%. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advantage over SfM-based approaches that our synthesized database enables localization in the reverse travel direction which is unseen during the mapping process. Our system, operating in real-time on a mobile laptop equipped with a GPU, achieves a processing rate of 1Hz.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valfride Nascimento, Rayson Laroca, Rafael O. Ribeiro, William Robson Schwartz, David Menotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in License Plate Recognition (LPR) through deep learning, most improvements rely on high-resolution images with clear characters. This scenario does not reflect real-world conditions where traffic surveillance often captures low-resolution and blurry images. Under these conditions, characters tend to blend with the background or neighboring characters, making accurate LPR challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a novel loss function, Layout and Character Oriented Focal Loss (LCOFL), which considers factors such as resolution, texture, and structural details, as well as the performance of the LPR task itself. We enhance character feature learning using deformable convolutions and shared weights in an attention module and employ a GAN-based training approach with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model as the discriminator to guide the super-resolution process. Our experimental results show significant improvements in character reconstruction quality, outperforming two state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcelo dos Santos, Rayson Laroca, Rafael O. Ribeiro, Jo\~ao C. Neves, David Menotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution algorithms often struggle with images from surveillance environments due to adverse conditions such as unknown degradation, variations in pose, irregular illumination, and occlusions. However, acquiring multiple images, even of low quality, is possible with surveillance cameras. In this work, we develop an algorithm based on diffusion models that utilize a low-resolution image combined with features extracted from multiple low-quality images to generate a super-resolved image while minimizing distortions in the individual's identity. Unlike other algorithms, our approach recovers facial features without explicitly providing attribute information or without the need to calculate a gradient of a function during the reconstruction process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time multi-features combined with low-resolution images are used as conditioners to generate more reliable super-resolution images using stochastic differential equations. The FFHQ dataset was employed for training, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in facial recognition and verification metrics when evaluated on the CelebA and Quis-Campi datasets.

<p>Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) relies on accurate depth estimation for 3D reconstruction and visualization. While foundation models like Depth Anything Models (DAM) show promise, directly applying them to surgery often yields suboptimal results. Fully fine-tuning on limited surgical data can cause overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, compromising model robustness and generalization. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses some adaptation issues, its uniform parameter distribution neglects the inherent feature hierarchy, where earlier layers, learning more general features, require more parameters than later ones. To tackle this issue, we introduce Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery (DARES), a novel approach that employs a new adaptation technique, Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (Vector-LoRA) on the DAM V2 to perform self-supervised monocular depth estimation in RAS scenes. To enhance learning efficiency, we introduce Vector-LoRA by integrating more parameters in earlier layers and gradually decreasing parameters in later layers. We also design a reprojection loss based on the multi-scale SSIM error to enhance depth perception by better tailoring the foundation model to the specific requirements of the surgical environment. The proposed method is validated on the SCARED dataset and demonstrates superior performance over recent state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation techniques, achieving an improvement of 13.3% in the absolute relative error metric.

<p>Abstract: Deep visual odometry, despite extensive research, still faces limitations in accuracy and generalizability that prevent its broader application. To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through the attention weights. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scene recognition, particularly for aerial and underwater images, often suffers from various types of degradation, such as blurring or overexposure. Previous works that focus on convolutional neural networks have been shown to be able to extract panoramic semantic features and perform well on scene recognition tasks. However, low-quality images still impede model performance due to the inappropriate use of high-level semantic features. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive selection mechanism to identify the most important and robust regions with high-level features. Thus, the model can perform learning via these regions to avoid interference. implement a learnable mask in the neural network, which can filter high-level features by assigning weights to different regions of the feature matrix. We also introduce a regularization term to further enhance the significance of key high-level feature regions. Different from previous methods, our learnable matrix pays extra attention to regions that are important to multiple categories but may cause misclassification and sets constraints to reduce the influence of such regions.This is a plug-and-play architecture that can be easily extended to other methods. Additionally, we construct an Underwater Geological Scene Classification dataset to assess the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed method over state-of-the-art techniques on two datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Guiding users through complex procedural plans is an inherently multimodal task in which having visually illustrated plan steps is crucial to deliver an effective plan guidance. However, existing works on plan-following language models (LMs) often are not capable of multimodal input and output. In this work, we present MM-PlanLLM, the first multimodal LLM designed to assist users in executing instructional tasks by leveraging both textual plans and visual information. Specifically, we bring cross-modality through two key tasks: Conversational Video Moment Retrieval, where the model retrieves relevant step-video segments based on user queries, and Visually-Informed Step Generation, where the model generates the next step in a plan, conditioned on an image of the user's current progress. MM-PlanLLM is trained using a novel multitask-multistage approach, designed to gradually expose the model to multimodal instructional-plans semantic layers, achieving strong performance on both multimodal and textual dialogue in a plan-grounded setting. Furthermore, we show that the model delivers cross-modal temporal and plan-structure representations aligned between textual plan steps and instructional video moments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We developed a robust solution for real-time 6D object detection in industrial applications by integrating FoundationPose, SAM2, and LightGlue, eliminating the need for retraining. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the requirement for an initial object mask in the first frame in FoundationPose and issues with tracking loss and automatic rotation for symmetric objects. The algorithm requires only a CAD model of the target object, with the user clicking on its location in the live feed during the initial setup. Once set, the algorithm automatically saves a reference image of the object and, in subsequent runs, employs LightGlue for feature matching between the object and the real-time scene, providing an initial prompt for detection. Tested on the YCB dataset and industrial components such as bleach cleanser and gears, the algorithm demonstrated reliable 6D detection and tracking. By integrating SAM2 and FoundationPose, we effectively mitigated common limitations such as the problem of tracking loss, ensuring continuous and accurate tracking under challenging conditions like occlusion or rapid movement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyue Qin, Yu Yin, Dylan Campbell, Xuansheng Wu, Ke Zou, Yih-Chung Tham, Ninghao Liu, Xiuzhen Zhang, Qingyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of vision-threatening eye diseases is a significant global burden, with many cases remaining undiagnosed or diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report presents PixelBytes, an approach for unified multimodal representation learning. Drawing inspiration from sequence models like Image Transformers, PixelCNN, and Mamba-Bytes, we explore integrating text, audio, action-state, and pixelated images (sprites) into a cohesive representation. We conducted experiments on a PixelBytes Pokemon dataset and an Optimal-Control dataset. Our investigation covered various model architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), State Space Models (SSMs), and Attention-based models, with a focus on bidirectional processing and our PxBy embedding technique. We evaluated models based on data reduction strategies and autoregressive learning, specifically examining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in predictive and autoregressive modes. Our results indicate that autoregressive models perform better than predictive models in this context. Additionally, we found that diffusion models can be applied to control problems and parallelized generation. PixelBytes aims to contribute to the development of foundation models for multimodal data processing and generation. The project's code, models, and datasets are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Cui, Weicai Ye, Yifan Wang, Guofeng Zhang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing urban street scenes is crucial due to its vital role in applications such as autonomous driving and urban planning. These scenes are characterized by long and narrow camera trajectories, occlusion, complex object relationships, and data sparsity across multiple scales. Despite recent advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction. StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and ensure scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy that leverages adjacent and long-term information. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of StreetSurfGS in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wu, Kecheng Zheng, Shuailei Ma, Fan Lu, Yuxin Guo, Yifei Zhang, Wei Chen, Qingpei Guo, Yujun Shen, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models. In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%). We will release the code, the model, and the new dataset to facilitate the reproducibility and further research. The project page is available at https://wuw2019.github.io/lot-lip.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianke Zhang, Yanjiang Guo, Xiaoyu Chen, Yen-Jen Wang, Yucheng Hu, Chengming Shi, Jianyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyu Hu, Tongkai Shi, Wei Feng, Fanhua Shang, Liang Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models have shown excellent performance over a series of tasks powered by the large corpus of paired multimodal training data. Generally, they are always assumed to receive modality-complete inputs. However, this simple assumption may not always hold in the real world due to privacy constraints or collection difficulty, where models pretrained on modality-complete data easily demonstrate degraded performance on missing-modality cases. To handle this issue, we refer to prompt learning to adapt large pretrained multimodal models to handle missing-modality scenarios by regarding different missing cases as different types of input. Instead of only prepending independent prompts to the intermediate layers, we present to leverage the correlations between prompts and input features and excavate the relationships between different layers of prompts to carefully design the instructions. We also incorporate the complementary semantics of different modalities to guide the prompting design for each modality. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the previous approaches upon different missing scenarios. Plentiful ablations are further given to show the generalizability and reliability of our method upon different modality-missing ratios and types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Long, Honglei Su, Qi Liu, Hui Yuan, Wei Gao, Jiarun Song, Zhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: No-reference bitstream-layer point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) can be deployed without full decoding at any network node to achieve real-time quality monitoring. In this work, we develop the first PCQA model dedicated to Trisoup-Lifting encoded 3D point clouds by analyzing bitstreams without full decoding. Specifically, we investigate the relationship among texture bitrate per point (TBPP), texture complexity (TC) and texture quantization parameter (TQP) while geometry encoding is lossless. Subsequently, we estimate TC by utilizing TQP and TBPP. Then, we establish a texture distortion evaluation model based on TC, TBPP and TQP. Ultimately, by integrating this texture distortion model with a geometry attenuation factor, a function of trisoupNodeSizeLog2 (tNSL), we acquire a comprehensive NR bitstream-layer PCQA model named streamPCQ-TL. In addition, this work establishes a database named WPC6.0, the first and largest PCQA database dedicated to Trisoup-Lifting encoding mode, encompassing 400 distorted point clouds with both 4 geometric multiplied by 5 texture distortion levels. Experiment results on M-PCCD, ICIP2020 and the proposed WPC6.0 database suggest that the proposed streamPCQ-TL model exhibits robust and notable performance in contrast to existing advanced PCQA metrics, particularly in terms of computational cost.

<p>Abstract: The on-board 3D object detection technology has received extensive attention as a critical technology for autonomous driving, while few studies have focused on applying roadside sensors in 3D traffic object detection. Existing studies achieve the projection of 2D image features to 3D features through height estimation based on the frustum. However, they did not consider the height alignment and the extraction efficiency of bird's-eye-view features. We propose a novel 3D object detection framework integrating Spatial Former and Voxel Pooling Former to enhance 2D-to-3D projection based on height estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted using the Rope3D and DAIR-V2X-I dataset, and the results demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed algorithm in the detection of both vehicles and cyclists. These results indicate that the algorithm is robust and generalized under various detection scenarios. Improving the accuracy of 3D object detection on the roadside is conducive to building a safe and trustworthy intelligent transportation system of vehicle-road coordination and promoting the large-scale application of autonomous driving.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijay Ghildyal, Yuanhan Chen, Saman Zadtootaghaj, Nabajeet Barman, Alan C. Bovik</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of AI has influenced many aspects of human life, from self-driving cars and intelligent chatbots to text-based image and video generation models capable of creating realistic images and videos based on user prompts (text-to-image, image-to-image, and image-to-video). AI-based methods for image and video super resolution, video frame interpolation, denoising, and compression have already gathered significant attention and interest in the industry and some solutions are already being implemented in real-world products and services. However, to achieve widespread integration and acceptance, AI-generated and enhanced content must be visually accurate, adhere to intended use, and maintain high visual quality to avoid degrading the end user's quality of experience (QoE).
  One way to monitor and control the visual "quality" of AI-generated and -enhanced content is by deploying Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models. However, most existing IQA and VQA models measure visual fidelity in terms of "reconstruction" quality against a pristine reference content and were not designed to assess the quality of "generative" artifacts. To address this, newer metrics and models have recently been proposed, but their performance evaluation and overall efficacy have been limited by datasets that were too small or otherwise lack representative content and/or distortion capacity; and by performance measures that can accurately report the success of an IQA/VQA model for "GenAI". This paper examines the current shortcomings and possibilities presented by AI-generated and enhanced image and video content, with a particular focus on end-user perceived quality. Finally, we discuss open questions and make recommendations for future work on the "GenAI" quality assessment problems, towards further progressing on this interesting and relevant field of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Arnav Sharma, Shubhi Bansal, Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Swift and accurate blood smear analysis is an effective diagnostic method for leukemia and other hematological malignancies. However, manual leukocyte count and morphological evaluation using a microscope is time-consuming and prone to errors. Conventional image processing methods also exhibit limitations in differentiating cells due to the visual similarity between malignant and benign cell morphology. This limitation is further compounded by the skewed training data that hinders the extraction of reliable and pertinent features. In response to these challenges, we propose an optimized Coupled Transformer Convolutional Network (CoTCoNet) framework for the classification of leukemia, which employs a well-designed transformer integrated with a deep convolutional network to effectively capture comprehensive global features and scalable spatial patterns, enabling the identification of complex and large-scale hematological features. Further, the framework incorporates a graph-based feature reconstruction module to reveal the hidden or unobserved hard-to-see biological features of leukocyte cells and employs a Population-based Meta-Heuristic Algorithm for feature selection and optimization. To mitigate data imbalance issues, we employ a synthetic leukocyte generator. In the evaluation phase, we initially assess CoTCoNet on a dataset containing 16,982 annotated cells, and it achieves remarkable accuracy and F1-Score rates of 0.9894 and 0.9893, respectively. To broaden the generalizability of our model, we evaluate it across four publicly available diverse datasets, which include the aforementioned dataset. This evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. We also incorporate an explainability approach in the form of feature visualization closely aligned with cell annotations to provide a deeper understanding of the framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaidong Li, Tianxiao Zhang, Cuncong Zhong, Ziming Zhang, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D point cloud classification requires distinct models from 2D image classification due to the divergent characteristics of the respective input data. While 3D point clouds are unstructured and sparse, 2D images are structured and dense. Bridging the domain gap between these two data types is a non-trivial challenge to enable model interchangeability. Recent research using Lattice Point Classifier (LPC) highlights the feasibility of cross-domain applicability. However, the lattice projection operation in LPC generates 2D images with disconnected projected pixels. In this paper, we explore three distinct algorithms for mapping 3D point clouds into 2D images. Through extensive experiments, we thoroughly examine and analyze their performance and defense mechanisms. Leveraging current large foundation models, we scrutinize the feature disparities between regular 2D images and projected 2D images. The proposed approaches demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. The generative model-based mapping algorithms yield regular 2D images, further minimizing the domain gap from regular 2D classification tasks.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated an impressive ability to produce high-quality outputs. However, they often struggle to accurately follow fine-grained spatial information in an input text. To this end, we propose a compositional approach for text-to-image generation based on two stages. In the first stage, we design a diffusion-based generative model to produce one or more aligned intermediate representations (such as depth or segmentation maps) conditioned on text. In the second stage, we map these representations, together with the text, to the final output image using a separate diffusion-based generative model. Our findings indicate that such compositional approach can improve image generation, resulting in a notable improvement in FID score and a comparable CLIP score, when compared to the standard non-compositional baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Sana, a text-to-image framework that can efficiently generate images up to 4096$\times$4096 resolution. Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include: (1) Deep compression autoencoder: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8$\times$, we trained an AE that can compress images 32$\times$, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens. (2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence. As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024$\times$1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Wei, Hsien Xin Peng, Elaine Xu, Bryan Zhao, Lei Ding, Diji Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Video-Language models (VLMs), grow in size, their deployment in real-world applications becomes increasingly challenging due to hardware limitations and computational costs. To address this, we design a hybrid edge-cloud solution that leverages the efficiency of smaller models for local processing while deferring to larger, more accurate cloud-based models when necessary. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised data generation method, Dual-Model Distillation (DMD), to train a lightweight switcher model that can predict when the edge model's output is uncertain and selectively offload inference to the large model in the cloud. Experimental results on the action classification task show that our framework not only requires less computational overhead, but also improves accuracy compared to using a large model alone. Our framework provides a scalable and adaptable solution for action classification in resource-constrained environments, with potential applications beyond healthcare. Noteworthy, while DMD-generated data is used for optimizing performance and resource usage in our pipeline, we expect the concept of DMD to further support future research on knowledge alignment across multiple models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongduan Tian, Feng Liu, Zhanke Zhou, Tongliang Liu, Chengqi Zhang, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: In cross-domain few-shot classification (CFC), recent works mainly focus on adapting a simple transformation head on top of a frozen pre-trained backbone with few labeled data to project embeddings into a task-specific metric space where classification can be performed by measuring similarities between image instance and prototype representations. Technically, an assumption implicitly adopted in such a framework is that the prototype and image instance embeddings share the same representation transformation. However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representations and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, contrastive prototype-image adaptation (CoPA), to adapt different transformations respectively for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts. Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate that CoPA achieves the state-of-the-art performance more efficiently. Meanwhile, further analyses also indicate that CoPA can learn better representation clusters, enlarge the gap, and achieve minimal validation loss at the enlarged gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) performs zero-shot image classification by mapping images and textual class representation into a shared embedding space, then retrieving the class closest to the image. This work provides a new approach for interpreting CLIP models for image classification from the lens of mutual knowledge between the two modalities. Specifically, we ask: what concepts do both vision and language CLIP encoders learn in common that influence the joint embedding space, causing points to be closer or further apart? We answer this question via an approach of textual concept-based explanations, showing their effectiveness, and perform an analysis encompassing a pool of 13 CLIP models varying in architecture, size and pretraining datasets. We explore those different aspects in relation to mutual knowledge, and analyze zero-shot predictions. Our approach demonstrates an effective and human-friendly way of understanding zero-shot classification decisions with CLIP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Closed-loop simulation is essential for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Contemporary sensor simulation methods, such as NeRF and 3DGS, rely predominantly on conditions closely aligned with training data distributions, which are largely confined to forward-driving scenarios. Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers (e.g., lane change, acceleration, deceleration). Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments. In this paper, we introduce DriveDreamer4D, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos based on real-world driving data. Notably, we explicitly leverage structured conditions to control the spatial-temporal consistency of foreground and background elements, thus the generated data adheres closely to traffic constraints. To our knowledge, DriveDreamer4D is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios. Experimental results reveal that DriveDreamer4D significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID by 24.5%, 39.0%, and 10.5% compared to PVG, S3Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, DriveDreamer4D markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 20.3%, 42.0%, and 13.7% in the NTA-IoU metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonhyeon Song, Seohwan Yun, Seongho Yoon, Joohyeok Kim, Sangmin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists. However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still struggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emerged yet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt the SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach transfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, thereby generating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU memory during training.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have yielded significant progress in vision-language understanding. Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation. In this work, we propose PUMA, emPowering Unified MLLM with Multi-grAnular visual generation. PUMA unifies multi-granular visual features as both inputs and outputs of MLLMs, elegantly addressing the different granularity requirements of various image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework. Following multimodal pretraining and task-specific instruction tuning, PUMA demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of multimodal tasks. This work represents a significant step towards a truly unified MLLM capable of adapting to the granularity demands of various visual tasks. The code and model will be released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/PUMA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangtao Kong, Kexin Huang, Ping Li, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangming Meng, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models and flow-based generative models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse problems, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc, with generative models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and colorization. In all these tasks, our method (namely DMPS) demonstrates highly competitive or even better reconstruction performances while being significantly faster than all the baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Hagemann, Sophie Mildenberger, Lars Ruthotto, Gabriele Steidl, Nicole Tianjiao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDM) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for image generation. Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of finite size. This paper develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is, we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain. In addition to the quest for generating images at ever-higher resolutions, our primary motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem that we can discretize consistently on multiple resolution levels. We thereby intend to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process using trace class operators to ensure that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive the reverse processes for finite-dimensional approximations. Second, we illustrate that approximating the score function with an operator network is beneficial for multilevel training. After deriving the convergence of the discretization and the approximation of multilevel training, we demonstrate some practical benefits of our infinite-dimensional SBDM approach on a synthetic Gaussian mixture example, the MNIST dataset, and a dataset generated from a nonlinear 2D reaction-diffusion equation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyuhak Kim, Changnan Xiao, Tatsuya Konishi, Zixuan Ke, Bing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI agents are increasingly used in the real open world with unknowns or novelties, they need the ability to (1) recognize objects that (a) they have learned before and (b) detect items that they have never seen or learned, and (2) learn the new items incrementally to become more and more knowledgeable and powerful. (1) is called novelty detection or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and (2) is called class incremental learning (CIL), which is a setting of continual learning (CL). In existing research, OOD detection and CIL are regarded as two completely different problems. This paper first provides a theoretical proof that good OOD detection for each task within the set of learned tasks (called closed-world OOD detection) is necessary for successful CIL. We show this by decomposing CIL into two sub-problems: within-task prediction (WP) and task-id prediction (TP), and proving that TP is correlated with closed-world OOD detection. The key theoretical result is that regardless of whether WP and OOD detection (or TP) are defined explicitly or implicitly by a CIL algorithm, good WP and good closed-world OOD detection are necessary and sufficient conditions for good CIL, which unifies novelty or OOD detection and continual learning (CIL, in particular). We call this traditional CIL the closed-world CIL as it does not detect future OOD data in the open world. The paper then proves that the theory can be generalized or extended to open-world CIL, which is the proposed open-world continual learning, that can perform CIL in the open world and detect future or open-world OOD data. Based on the theoretical results, new CIL methods are also designed, which outperform strong baselines in CIL accuracy and in continual OOD detection by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florentin Guth, Brice M\'enard, Gaspar Rochette, St\'ephane Mallat</p>
<p>Abstract: A central question in deep learning is to understand the functions learned by deep networks. What is their approximation class? Do the learned weights and representations depend on initialization? Previous empirical work has evidenced that kernels defined by network activations are similar across initializations. For shallow networks, this has been theoretically studied with random feature models, but an extension to deep networks has remained elusive. Here, we provide a deep extension of such random feature models, which we call the rainbow model. We prove that rainbow networks define deterministic (hierarchical) kernels in the infinite-width limit. The resulting functions thus belong to a data-dependent RKHS which does not depend on the weight randomness. We also verify numerically our modeling assumptions on deep CNNs trained on image classification tasks, and show that the trained networks approximately satisfy the rainbow hypothesis. In particular, rainbow networks sampled from the corresponding random feature model achieve similar performance as the trained networks. Our results highlight the central role played by the covariances of network weights at each layer, which are observed to be low-rank as a result of feature learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ludovica Schaerf, Pepe Ballesteros, Valentine Bernasconi, Iacopo Neri, Dario Negueruela del Castillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Art curatorial practice is characterized by the presentation of an art collection in a knowledgeable way. Machine processes are characterized by their capacity to manage and analyze large amounts of data. This paper envisages AI curation and audience interaction to explore the implications of contemporary machine learning models for the curatorial world. This project was developed for the occasion of the 2023 Helsinki Art Biennial, entitled New Directions May Emerge. We use the Helsinki Art Museum (HAM) collection to re-imagine the city of Helsinki through the lens of machine perception. We use visual-textual models to place indoor artworks in public spaces, assigning fictional coordinates based on similarity scores. We transform the space that each artwork inhabits in the city by generating synthetic 360 art panoramas. We guide the generation estimating depth values from 360 panoramas at each artwork location, and machine-generated prompts of the artworks. The result of this project is an AI curation that places the artworks in their imagined physical space, blurring the lines of artwork, context, and machine perception. The work is virtually presented as a web-based installation on this link http://newlyformedcity.net/, where users can navigate an alternative version of the city while exploring and interacting with its cultural heritage at scale.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07996">Reset It and Forget It: Relearning Last-Layer Weights Improves Continual and Transfer Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lapo Frati, Neil Traft, Jeff Clune, Nick Cheney</p>
<p>Abstract: This work identifies a simple pre-training mechanism that leads to representations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This mechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we nickname "zapping" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning procedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond both meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to transfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few shots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy and/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual learning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally efficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art meta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a combination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for the effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained with repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to newly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a computationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly adaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the usefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites further investigation of this mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanting Yang, Yiren Zhang, Zongyu Li, Jeffery Siyuan Tian, Matthieu Dagommer, Jia Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep complex-valued neural networks provide a powerful way to leverage complex number operations and representations and have succeeded in several phase-based applications. However, most previously published networks have not fully explored the impact of complex-valued networks in the frequency domain. Here, we introduce a unified complex-valued deep learning framework-Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFTNet)-which combines domain-manifold learning and complex-valued neural networks. AFTNet can be readily used to solve image inverse problems in domain transformation, especially for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction and other applications. While conventional methods only accept magnitude images, the proposed method takes raw k-space data in the frequency domain as input, allowing a mapping between the k-space and image domains to be determined through cross-domain learning. We show that AFTNet achieves superior accelerated MRI reconstruction compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to various tasks, such as denoised magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction and datasets with various contrasts. The AFTNet presented here is a valuable preprocessing component for different preclinical studies and provides an innovative alternative for solving inverse problems in imaging and spectroscopy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mareike Thies, Fabian Wagner, Noah Maul, Haijun Yu, Manuela Goldmann, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Mingxuan Gu, Siyuan Mei, Lukas Folle, Alexander Preuhs, Michael Manhart, Andreas Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, with their flexibility, present a promising avenue for direct point-of-care medical imaging, particularly in critical scenarios such as acute stroke assessment. However, the integration of CBCT into clinical workflows faces challenges, primarily linked to long scan duration resulting in patient motion during scanning and leading to image quality degradation in the reconstructed volumes. This paper introduces a novel approach to CBCT motion estimation using a gradient-based optimization algorithm, which leverages generalized derivatives of the backprojection operator for cone-beam CT geometries. Building on that, a fully differentiable target function is formulated which grades the quality of the current motion estimate in reconstruction space. We drastically accelerate motion estimation yielding a 19-fold speed-up compared to existing methods. Additionally, we investigate the architecture of networks used for quality metric regression and propose predicting voxel-wise quality maps, favoring autoencoder-like architectures over contracting ones. This modification improves gradient flow, leading to more accurate motion estimation. The presented method is evaluated through realistic experiments on head anatomy. It achieves a reduction in reprojection error from an initial average of 3mm to 0.61mm after motion compensation and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. The analytic Jacobian for the backprojection operation, which is at the core of the proposed method, is made publicly available. In summary, this paper contributes to the advancement of CBCT integration into clinical workflows by proposing a robust motion estimation approach that enhances efficiency and accuracy, addressing critical challenges in time-sensitive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanghao Su, Jie Zhang, Ting Xu, Tianwei Zhang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant security vulnerability for deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling them to operate normally on clean inputs but manipulate predictions when specific trigger patterns occur. Currently, post-training backdoor detection approaches often operate under the assumption that the defender has knowledge of the attack information, logit output from the model, and knowledge of the model parameters. In contrast, our approach functions as a lightweight diagnostic scanning tool offering interpretability and visualization. By accessing the model to obtain hard labels, we construct decision boundaries within the convex combination of three samples. We present an intriguing observation of two phenomena in backdoored models: a noticeable shrinking of areas dominated by clean samples and a significant increase in the surrounding areas dominated by target labels. Leveraging this observation, we propose Model X-ray, a novel backdoor detection approach based on the analysis of illustrated two-dimensional (2D) decision boundaries. Our approach includes two strategies focused on the decision areas dominated by clean samples and the concentration of label distribution, and it can not only identify whether the target model is infected but also determine the target attacked label under the all-to-one attack strategy. Importantly, it accomplishes this solely by the predicted hard labels of clean inputs, regardless of any assumptions about attacks and prior knowledge of the training details of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrated that Model X-ray has outstanding effectiveness and efficiency across diverse backdoor attacks, datasets, and architectures. Besides, ablation studies on hyperparameters and more attack strategies and discussions are also provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aozhong Zhang, Zi Yang, Naigang Wang, Yingyong Qi, Jack Xin, Xin Li, Penghang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a practical approach to compress large neural networks, making them highly efficient for deployment. However, effectively reducing these models to their low-bit counterparts without compromising the original accuracy remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative PTQ algorithm termed COMQ, which sequentially conducts coordinate-wise minimization of the layer-wise reconstruction errors. We consider the widely used integer quantization, where every quantized weight can be decomposed into a shared floating-point scalar and an integer bit-code. Within a fixed layer, COMQ treats all the scaling factor(s) and bit-codes as the variables of the reconstruction error. Every iteration improves this error along a single coordinate while keeping all other variables constant. COMQ is easy to use and requires no hyper-parameter tuning. It instead involves only dot products and rounding operations. We update these variables in a carefully designed greedy order, significantly enhancing the accuracy. COMQ achieves remarkable results in quantizing 4-bit Vision Transformers, with a negligible loss of less than 1% in Top-1 accuracy. In 4-bit INT quantization of convolutional neural networks, COMQ maintains near-lossless accuracy with a minimal drop of merely 0.3% in Top-1 accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Requiring extensive human supervision is often impractical for continual learning due to its cost, leading to the emergence of 'name-only continual learning' that only provides the name of new concepts (e.g., classes) without providing supervised samples. To address the task, recent approach uses web-scraped data but results in issues such as data imbalance, copyright, and privacy concerns. To overcome the limitations of both human supervision and webly supervision, we propose Generative name only Continual Learning (GenCL) using generative models for the name only continual learning. But na\"ive application of generative models results in limited diversity of generated data. So, we specifically propose a diverse prompt generation method, HIerarchical Recurrent Prompt Generation (HIRPG) as well as COmplexity-NAvigating eNsembler (CONAN) that selects samples with minimal overlap from multiple generative models. We empirically validate that the proposed GenCL outperforms prior arts, even a model trained with fully supervised data, in various tasks including image recognition and multi-modal visual reasoning.

<p>Abstract: In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to argue that choosing appropriate class pruning ratios, coupled with random pruning within classes has potential to improve worst-class performance. We thus propose DRoP, a distributionally robust approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving distributional robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Z. Xiao, Robert Bamler, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Weiyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the progress made by large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML). In contrast to conventional machine learning (ML) models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language. Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical ML problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer. The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why an update is performed. We empirically verify the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Echocardiography is the only technique capable of real-time imaging of the heart and is vital for diagnosing the majority of cardiac diseases. However, there is a severe shortage of experienced cardiac sonographers, due to the heart's complex structure and significant operational challenges. To mitigate this situation, we present a Cardiac Copilot system capable of providing real-time probe movement guidance to assist less experienced sonographers in conducting freehand echocardiography. This system can enable non-experts, especially in primary departments and medically underserved areas, to perform cardiac ultrasound examinations, potentially improving global healthcare delivery. The core innovation lies in proposing a data-driven world model, named Cardiac Dreamer, for representing cardiac spatial structures. This world model can provide structure features of any cardiac planes around the current probe position in the latent space, serving as an precise navigation map for autonomous plane localization. We train our model with real-world ultrasound data and corresponding probe motion from 110 routine clinical scans with 151K sample pairs by three certified sonographers. Evaluations on three standard planes with 37K sample pairs demonstrate that the world model can reduce navigation errors by up to 33\% and exhibit more stable performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance.
  In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models.
  We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengcheng Luo, Quanquan Peng, Jun Lv, Kaiwen Hong, Katherine Rose Driggs-Campbell, Cewu Lu, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers the potential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However, teleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via a teleoperation system presents inherent challenges due to the task's high dimensionality, complexity of motion, and differences between physiological structures. In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning between human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share control of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies the data collection process, and facilitates simultaneous human demonstration collection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistive agent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are required, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It also allows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-off between manual and automated control. We conducted experiments in both simulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studies and quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system could enhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptation while ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstream tasks. \textit{For more details, please refer to our webpage https://norweig1an.github.io/HAJL.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremias Traub, Till J. Bungert, Carsten T. L\"uth, Michael Baumgartner, Klaus H. Maier-Hein, Lena Maier-Hein, Paul F Jaeger</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective Classification, wherein models can reject low-confidence predictions, promises reliable translation of machine-learning based classification systems to real-world scenarios such as clinical diagnostics. While current evaluation of these systems typically assumes fixed working points based on pre-defined rejection thresholds, methodological progress requires benchmarking the general performance of systems akin to the $\mathrm{AUROC}$ in standard classification. In this work, we define 5 requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification regarding task alignment, interpretability, and flexibility, and show how current approaches fail to meet them. We propose the Area under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve ($\mathrm{AUGRC}$), which meets all requirements and can be directly interpreted as the average risk of undetected failures. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of $\mathrm{AUGRC}$ on a comprehensive benchmark spanning 6 data sets and 13 confidence scoring functions. We find that the proposed metric substantially changes metric rankings on 5 out of the 6 data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fred Grabovski, Lior Yasur, Guy Amit, Yisroel Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in generative models has made it easier for a wide audience to edit and create image content, raising concerns about the proliferation of deepfakes, especially in healthcare. Despite the availability of numerous techniques for detecting manipulated images captured by conventional cameras, their applicability to medical images is limited. This limitation stems from the distinctive forensic characteristics of medical images, a result of their imaging process.
  In this work we propose a novel anomaly detector for medical imagery based on diffusion models. Normally, diffusion models are used to generate images. However, we show how a similar process can be used to detect synthetic content by making a model reverse the diffusion on a suspected image. We evaluate our method on the task of detecting fake tumors injected and removed from CT and MRI scans. Our method significantly outperforms other state of the art unsupervised detectors with an increased AUC of 0.9 from 0.79 for injection and of 0.96 from 0.91 for removal on average. We also explore our hypothesis using AI explainability tools and publish our code and new medical deepfake datasets to encourage further research into this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Nengmin Yi, Shengbo Tan, Ying Cai, Yi Yang, Lei Xu, Qingtai Li, Zhang Yi, Daji Ergu, Yang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cervical disc herniation (CDH) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that significantly impacts health and requires labor-intensive analysis from experts. Despite advancements in automated detection of medical imaging, two significant challenges hinder the real-world application of these methods. First, the computational complexity and resource demands present a significant gap for real-time application. Second, noise in MRI reduces the effectiveness of existing methods by distorting feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose three key contributions: Firstly, we introduced MedDet, which leverages the multi-teacher single-student knowledge distillation for model compression and efficiency, meanwhile integrating generative adversarial training to enhance performance. Additionally, we customize the second-order nmODE to improve the model's resistance to noise in MRI. Lastly, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the CDH-1848 dataset, achieving up to a 5% improvement in mAP compared to previous methods. Our approach also delivers over 5 times faster inference speed, with approximately 67.8% reduction in parameters and 36.9% reduction in FLOPs compared to the teacher model. These advancements significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of automated CDH detection, demonstrating promising potential for future application in clinical practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Luo, Dario Sesia, Fanwen Wang, Yinzhe Wu, Wenhao Ding, Jiahao Huang, Fadong Shi, Anoop Shah, Amit Kaural, Jamil Mayet, Guang Yang, ChoonHwai Yap</p>
<p>Abstract: Mesh reconstruction of the cardiac anatomy from medical images is useful for shape and motion measurements and biophysics simulations to facilitate the assessment of cardiac function and health. However, 3D medical images are often acquired as 2D slices that are sparsely sampled and noisy, and mesh reconstruction on such data is a challenging task. Traditional voxel-based approaches rely on pre- and post-processing that compromises image fidelity, while mesh-level deep learning approaches require mesh annotations that are difficult to get. Therefore, direct cross-domain supervision from 2D images to meshes is a key technique for advancing 3D learning in medical imaging, but it has not been well-developed. While there have been attempts to approximate the optimized meshes' slicing, few existing methods directly use 2D slices to supervise mesh reconstruction in a differentiable manner. Here, we propose a novel explicit differentiable voxelization and slicing (DVS) algorithm that allows gradient backpropagation to a mesh from its slices, facilitating refined mesh optimization directly supervised by the losses defined on 2D images. Further, we propose an innovative framework for extracting patient-specific left ventricle (LV) meshes from medical images by coupling DVS with a graph harmonic deformation (GHD) mesh morphing descriptor of cardiac shape that naturally preserves mesh quality and smoothness during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cardiac mesh reconstruction tasks from CT and MRI, with an overall Dice score of 90% on multi-datasets, outperforming existing approaches. The proposed method can further quantify clinically useful parameters such as ejection fraction and global myocardial strains, closely matching the ground truth and surpassing the traditional voxel-based approach in sparse images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Rokuss, Balint Kovacs, Yannick Kirchhoff, Shuhan Xiao, Constantin Ulrich, Klaus H. Maier-Hein, Fabian Isensee</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated lesion segmentation in PET/CT scans is crucial for improving clinical workflows and advancing cancer diagnostics. However, the task is challenging due to physiological variability, different tracers used in PET imaging, and diverse imaging protocols across medical centers. To address this, the autoPET series was created to challenge researchers to develop algorithms that generalize across diverse PET/CT environments. This paper presents our solution for the autoPET III challenge, targeting multitracer, multicenter generalization using the nnU-Net framework with the ResEncL architecture. Key techniques include misalignment data augmentation and multi-modal pretraining across CT, MR, and PET datasets to provide an initial anatomical understanding. We incorporate organ supervision as a multitask approach, enabling the model to distinguish between physiological uptake and tracer-specific patterns, which is particularly beneficial in cases where no lesions are present. Compared to the default nnU-Net, which achieved a Dice score of 57.61, or the larger ResEncL (65.31) our model significantly improved performance with a Dice score of 68.40, alongside a reduction in false positive (FPvol: 7.82) and false negative (FNvol: 10.35) volumes. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining advanced network design, augmentation, pretraining, and multitask learning for PET/CT lesion segmentation. After evaluation on the test set, our approach was awarded the first place in the model-centric category (Team LesionTracer).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Lin, Hezheng Lin, Shuchang Liu, Cangguang Ruan, LingJing Xu, Dezhao Yang, Chuyuan Wang, Yongqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of online micro-video platforms has underscored the necessity for advanced recommender systems to mitigate information overload and deliver tailored content. Despite advancements, accurately and promptly capturing dynamic user interests remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that different data modalities converge towards a shared statistical model of reality, we introduce DreamUMM (Dreaming User Multi-Modal Representation), a novel approach leveraging user historical behaviors to create real-time user representation in a multimoda space. DreamUMM employs a closed-form solution correlating user video preferences with multimodal similarity, hypothesizing that user interests can be effectively represented in a unified multimodal space. Additionally, we propose Candidate-DreamUMM for scenarios lacking recent user behavior data, inferring interests from candidate videos alone. Extensive online A/B tests demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement metrics, including active days and play count. The successful deployment of DreamUMM in two micro-video platforms with hundreds of millions of daily active users, illustrates its practical efficacy and scalability in personalized micro-video content delivery. Our work contributes to the ongoing exploration of representational convergence by providing empirical evidence supporting the potential for user interest representations to reside in a multimodal space.</p>

The method consists of three sequential modules that estimate camera poses in a coarse-to-fine manner. Unlike mainstream approaches relying on detailed 3D representations, LiteVLoc reduces storage overhead by leveraging learning-based feature matching and geometric solvers for metric pose estimation. A novel dataset for the map-free relocalization task is also introduced.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chen, Qian Chen, Jian Lou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Kai Wu, Zilong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is becoming a promising paradigm to achieve the "right to be forgotten", where the training trace of any chosen data points could be eliminated, while maintaining the model utility on general testing samples after unlearning. With the advancement of forgetting research, many fundamental open questions remain unanswered: do different samples exhibit varying levels of difficulty in being forgotten? Further, does the sequence in which samples are forgotten, determined by their respective difficulty levels, influence the performance of forgetting algorithms? In this paper, we identify key factor affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms. We find that samples with higher privacy risks are more likely to be unlearning, indicating that the unlearning difficulty varies among different samples which motives a more precise unlearning mode. Built upon this insight, we propose a general unlearning framework, dubbed RSU, which consists of Ranking module and SeqUnlearn module.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10929">ASTM :Autonomous Smart Traffic Management System Using Artificial Intelligence CNN and LSTM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christofel Rio Goenawan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^2$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^2$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^2$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.95% and 20.76% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.</p>
