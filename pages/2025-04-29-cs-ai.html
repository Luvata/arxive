<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Quiser Ahmed, Bharathi Vokkaliga Ganesh, Jagadish Babu P, Karthick Selvaraj, ReddySiva Naga Parvathi Devi, Sravya Kappala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their decision-making processes often lack transparency. This opaqueness raises significant concerns regarding trust, bias, and model performance. To address these issues, understanding and evaluating the interpretability of LLMs is crucial. This paper introduces a standardised benchmarking technique, Benchmarking the Explainability of Large Language Models, designed to evaluate the explainability of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saizhuo Wang, Hao Kong, Jiadong Guo, Fengrui Hua, Yiyan Qi, Wanyun Zhou, Jiahao Zheng, Xinyu Wang, Lionel M. Ni, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) in quantitative investment has seen significant advancements, yet it lacks a standardized benchmark aligned with industry practices. This gap hinders research progress and limits the practical application of academic innovations. We present QuantBench, an industrial-grade benchmark platform designed to address this critical need. QuantBench offers three key strengths: (1) standardization that aligns with quantitative investment industry practices, (2) flexibility to integrate various AI algorithms, and (3) full-pipeline coverage of the entire quantitative investment process. Our empirical studies using QuantBench reveal some critical research directions, including the need for continual learning to address distribution shifts, improved methods for modeling relational financial data, and more robust approaches to mitigate overfitting in low signal-to-noise environments. By providing a common ground for evaluation and fostering collaboration between researchers and practitioners, QuantBench aims to accelerate progress in AI for quantitative investment, similar to the impact of benchmark platforms in computer vision and natural language processing.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18604">A Cognitive-Mechanistic Human Reliability Analysis Framework: A Nuclear Power Plant Case Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Xiao, Peng Chen, Jiejuan Tong, Shunshun Liu, Hongru Zhao, Jun Zhao, Qianqian Jia, Jingang Liang, Haitao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA, rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingxin Lu, Shurui Wu, Xinyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the timely formation of personalized intervention plans based on high-dimensional heterogeneous time series information becoming an important challenge in the medical field today, electronic medical records, wearables, and other multi-source medical data are increasingly generated and diversified. In this work, we develop a system to generate personalized medical intervention strategies based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Time-Series Data Fusion. First, by incorporating relative policy constraints among the groups during policy gradient updates, we adaptively balance individual and group gains. To improve the robustness and interpretability of decision-making, a multi-layer neural network structure is employed to group-code patient characteristics. Second, for the rapid multi-modal fusion of multi-source heterogeneous time series, a multi-channel neural network combined with a self-attention mechanism is used for dynamic feature extraction. Key feature screening and aggregation are achieved through a differentiable gating network. Finally, a collaborative search process combining a genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search is proposed to find the ideal intervention strategy, achieving global optimization. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, coverage, and decision-making benefits compared with existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Managing scientific names in ontologies that represent species taxonomies is challenging due to the ever-evolving nature of these taxonomies. Manually maintaining these names becomes increasingly difficult when dealing with thousands of scientific names. To address this issue, this paper investigates the use of ChatGPT-4 to automate the development of the :Organism module in the Agricultural Product Types Ontology (APTO) for species classification. Our methodology involved leveraging ChatGPT-4 to extract data from the GBIF Backbone API and generate OWL files for further integration in APTO. Two alternative approaches were explored: (1) issuing a series of prompts for ChatGPT-4 to execute tasks via the BrowserOP plugin and (2) directing ChatGPT-4 to design a Python algorithm to perform analogous tasks. Both approaches rely on a prompting method where we provide instructions, context, input data, and an output indicator. The first approach showed scalability limitations, while the second approach used the Python algorithm to overcome these challenges, but it struggled with typographical errors in data handling. This study highlights the potential of Large language models like ChatGPT-4 to streamline the management of species names in ontologies. Despite certain limitations, these tools offer promising advancements in automating taxonomy-related tasks and improving the efficiency of ontology development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) detection presents significant challenges due to the subtle and often ambiguous presentation of symptoms in medical imaging, making accurate diagnosis a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI prediction tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creative processes are typically divided into three types: combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational. Here, we provide a graphical theory of transformational scientific creativity, synthesizing Boden's insight that transformational creativity arises from changes in the "enabling constraints" of a conceptual space and Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions as resulting from paradigm shifts. We prove that modifications made to axioms of our graphical model have the most transformative potential and then illustrate how several historical instances of transformational creativity can be captured by our framework.</p>

This process typically requires a deep human involvement because of the need for interpretation and decision-making when translating complex features. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an alternative to conducting map digitization with the help of machine learning techniques. Deepness, or Deep Neural Remote Sensing, is an advanced AI-driven tool designed and integrated as a plugin in QGIS application. This research focuses on assessing the effectiveness of Deepness in automated digitization.

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is hypothesized to be able to take advantage of the inherent hierarchy in robot learning tasks with sparse reward schemes, in contrast to more traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. In this research, hierarchical reinforcement learning is evaluated and contrasted with standard reinforcement learning in complex navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including their ability to create sub-goals and the termination function. We constructed experiments to test the differences between PPO and HRL, different ways of creating sub-goals, manual vs automatic sub-goal creation, and the effects of the frequency of termination on performance. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL and how it achieves these advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) builds upon Generative AI (GenAI). It constitutes the next major step in the evolution of AI with much stronger reasoning and interaction capabilities that enable more autonomous behavior to tackle complex tasks. Since the initial release of ChatGPT (3.5), Generative AI has seen widespread adoption, giving users firsthand experience. However, the distinction between Agentic AI and GenAI remains less well understood. To address this gap, our survey is structured in two parts. In the first part, we compare GenAI and Agentic AI using existing literature, discussing their key characteristics, how Agentic AI remedies limitations of GenAI, and the major steps in GenAI's evolution toward Agentic AI. This section is intended for a broad audience, including academics in both social sciences and engineering, as well as industry professionals. It provides the necessary insights to comprehend novel applications that are possible with Agentic AI but not with GenAI. In the second part, we deep dive into novel aspects of Agentic AI, including recent developments and practical concerns such as defining agents. Finally, we discuss several challenges that could serve as a future research agenda, while cautioning against risks that can emerge when exceeding human intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF synthesis of all researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devesh Pant, Dibyendu Talukder, Deepak Kumar, Rachit Pandey, Aaditeshwar Seth, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of development programmes can involve field-based data collection about project activities. This data collection through digital devices may not always be feasible though, for reasons such as unaffordability of smartphones and tablets by field-based cadre, or shortfalls in their training and capacity building. Paper-based data collection has been argued to be more appropriate in several contexts, with automated digitization of the paper forms through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) techniques. We contribute with providing a large dataset of handwritten digits, and deep learning based models and methods built using this data, that are effective in real-world environments. We demonstrate the deployment of these tools in the context of a maternal and child health and nutrition awareness project, which uses IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems to provide awareness information to rural women SHG (Self Help Group) members in north India. Paper forms were used to collect phone numbers of the SHG members at scale, which were digitized using the OCR tools developed by us, and used to push almost 4 million phone calls. The data, model, and code have been released in the open-source domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin M\"ucke, Ansgar Scherp</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic reasoning aims to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge, with OWL ontologies serving as a standardized framework for organizing information. A key challenge in semantic reasoning is verifying ontology consistency. However, state-of-the-art reasoners are computationally expensive, and their efficiency decreases as ontology sizes grow. While classical machine learning models have been explored for consistency checking, they struggle to capture complex relationships within ontologies. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for simple reasoning tasks but perform poorly on structured reasoning. The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers a way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper proposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that transforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM architecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model input. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving $95\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volkan Bakir, Polat Goktas, Sureyya Akyuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work will explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowei Wang, Jiaran Gao, Yelai Feng, Renzhi Chen, Shanshan Li, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for Domain-Specific Architecture (DSA) has driven the development of Agile Hardware Development Methodology (AHDM). Hardware Construction Language (HCL) like Chisel offers high-level abstraction features, making it an ideal language for HCL-Based AHDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation tasks, they still face challenges with Chisel generation, particularly regarding syntax correctness and design variability. Recent reasoning models have significantly enhanced code generation capabilities through test-time scaling techniques. However, we found that reasoning models without domain adaptation cannot bring substantial benefits to Chisel code generation tasks. This paper presents ChiseLLM, a solution comprising data processing and transformation, prompt-guided reasoning trace synthesis, and domain-adapted model training. We constructed high-quality datasets from public RTL code resources and guided the model to adopt structured thinking patterns through prompt enhancement methods. Experiments demonstrate that our ChiseLLM-7B and ChiseLLM-32B models improved syntax correctness by 18.85% and 26.32% respectively over base models, while increasing variability design ability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning models. Our datasets and models are publicly available, providing high-performance, cost-effective models for HCL-Based AHDM, and offering an effective baseline for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Liu, Jing Ma, Edmund M-K Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an Adaptive Dynamic Attribute and Rule (ADAR) framework designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in neuro-fuzzy inference systems. By integrating dual weighting mechanisms-assigning adaptive importance to both attributes and rules-together with automated growth and pruning strategies, ADAR adaptively streamlines complex fuzzy models without sacrificing performance or interpretability. Experimental evaluations on four diverse datasets - Auto MPG (7 variables), Beijing PM2.5 (10 variables), Boston Housing (13 variables), and Appliances Energy Consumption (27 variables) show that ADAR-based models achieve consistently lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On the Beijing PM2.5 dataset, for instance, ADAR-SOFENN attained an RMSE of 56.87 with nine rules, surpassing traditional ANFIS [12] and SOFENN [16] models. Similarly, on the high-dimensional Appliances Energy dataset, ADAR-ANFIS reached an RMSE of 83.25 with nine rules, outperforming established fuzzy logic approaches and interpretability-focused methods such as APLR. Ablation studies further reveal that combining rule-level and attribute-level weight assignment significantly reduces model overlap while preserving essential features, thereby enhancing explainability. These results highlight ADAR's effectiveness in dynamically balancing rule complexity and feature importance, paving the way for scalable, high-accuracy, and transparent neuro-fuzzy systems applicable to a range of real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro A. Moreno-S\'anchez, Javier Del Ser, Mark van Gils, Jussi Hernesniemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and patient care. The increasing availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of trust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes (e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in practice. To ground the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, a field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chad Coleman, W. Russell Neuman, Ali Dasdan, Safinah Ali, Manan Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions. Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1) produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishan Kavathekar, Raghav Donakanti, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Karthik Vaidhyanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Function calling is a complex task with widespread applications in domains such as information retrieval, software engineering and automation. For example, a query to book the shortest flight from New York to London on January 15 requires identifying the correct parameters to generate accurate function calls. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process but are computationally expensive and impractical in resource-constrained settings. In contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) can operate efficiently, offering faster response times, and lower computational demands, making them potential candidates for function calling on edge devices. In this exploratory empirical study, we evaluate the efficacy of SLMs in generating function calls across diverse domains using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches, both with and without prompt injection, while also providing the finetuned models to facilitate future applications. Furthermore, we analyze the model responses across a range of metrics, capturing various aspects of function call generation. Additionally, we perform experiments on an edge device to evaluate their performance in terms of latency and memory usage, providing useful insights into their practical applicability. Our findings show that while SLMs improve from zero-shot to few-shot and perform best with fine-tuning, they struggle significantly with adhering to the given output format. Prompt injection experiments further indicate that the models are generally robust and exhibit only a slight decline in performance. While SLMs demonstrate potential for the function call generation task, our results also highlight areas that need further refinement for real-time functioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ralph Wojtowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper seeks to apply categorical logic to the design of artificial intelligent agents that reason symbolically about objects more richly structured than sets. Using Johnstone's sequent calculus of terms- and formulae-in-context, we develop forward chaining and normal form algorithms for reasoning about objects in cartesian categories with the rules for Horn logic. We also adapt first-order unification to support multi-sorted theories, contexts, and fragments of first-order logic. The significance of these reformulations rests in the fact that they can be applied to reasoning about objects in semantic categories that do not support classical logic or even all its connectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkan Karabulut, Paul Groth, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omid Semiari, Hosein Nikopour, Shilpa Talwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaichen Zhang, Yuzhong Hong, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song, Dingqian Hong, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits their practical adoption. To address this challenge, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Sangryul Kim, James Thorne</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology: language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Qingfu Zhang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan, Kun Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly, resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks, and collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations, multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments. Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025 that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research, academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems, multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally, we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025, a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles, and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery and broader scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Lo Bianco, Willem van Jaarsveld, Jeroen Middelhuis, Luca Begnardi, Remco Dijkman</p>
<p>Abstract: The Dynamic Task Assignment Problem (DTAP) concerns matching resources to tasks in real time while minimizing some objectives, like resource costs or task cycle time. In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case, involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS. To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on different time horizons and across instances.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19968">How Group Lives Go Well</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> John Beverley, Regina Hurley</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the ontological space of group well being, proposing a framework for representing collective welfare, group functions, and long term contributions within an ontology engineering context. Traditional well being theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions, allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and group flourishing over time.</p>

These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent (PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a blind review and AI evaluations.

This systematic review sheds light on the critical importance of rigorous evaluation of synthetic health data to ensure reliability, relevance, and their appropriate use. Based on screening of 1766 papers and a detailed review of 101 papers we identified key challenges, including lack of consensus on evaluation methods, improper use of evaluation metrics, limited input from domain experts, inadequate reporting of dataset characteristics, and limited reproducibility of results. In response, we provide several guidelines on the generation and evaluation of synthetic data, to allow the community to unlock and fully harness the transformative potential of synthetic data and accelerate innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialei Song, Xingquan Zuo, Feiyang Wang, Hai Huang, Tianle Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently, methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming, while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based on sample clustering features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD attack. Our open-source code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDI-B1DA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models, especially large Transformers, carry substantial "memory" in their intermediate layers -- an \emph{internal world} that encodes a wealth of relational and contextual knowledge. This work harnesses that internal world for wildfire occurrence prediction by introducing a modular architecture built upon Gemma 3, a state-of-the-art multimodal model. Rather than relying on Gemma 3's original embedding and positional encoding stacks, we develop a custom feed-forward module that transforms tabular wildfire features into the hidden dimension required by Gemma 3's mid-layer Transformer blocks. We freeze these Gemma 3 sub-layers -- thus preserving their pretrained representation power -- while training only the smaller input and output networks. This approach minimizes the number of trainable parameters and reduces the risk of overfitting on limited wildfire data, yet retains the benefits of Gemma 3's broad knowledge. Evaluations on a Moroccan wildfire dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to standard feed-forward and convolutional baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the frozen Transformer layers consistently contribute to better representations, underscoring the feasibility of reusing large-model mid-layers as a learned internal world. Our findings suggest that strategic modular reuse of pretrained Transformers can enable more data-efficient and interpretable solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abha Jha, Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan, Matthew Salaway, Atharva Sandeep Bhide, Duygu Nur Yaldiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms, generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy. Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable, and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhe Huang, Kedong Xiu, Tianhang Zheng, Churui Zeng, Wangze Ni, Zhan Qiin, Kui Ren, Chun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has focused on exploring the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to elicit harmful and/or sensitive content from LLMs. However, due to the insufficient research on dual-jailbreaking -- attacks targeting both LLMs and Guardrails, the effectiveness of existing attacks is limited when attempting to bypass safety-aligned LLMs shielded by guardrails. Therefore, in this paper, we propose DualBreach, a target-driven framework for dual-jailbreaking. DualBreach employs a Target-driven Initialization (TDI) strategy to dynamically construct initial prompts, combined with a Multi-Target Optimization (MTO) method that utilizes approximate gradients to jointly adapt the prompts across guardrails and LLMs, which can simultaneously save the number of queries and achieve a high dual-jailbreaking success rate. For black-box guardrails, DualBreach either employs a powerful open-sourced guardrail or imitates the target black-box guardrail by training a proxy model, to incorporate guardrails into the MTO process.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of DualBreach in dual-jailbreaking scenarios through extensive evaluation on several widely-used datasets. Experimental results indicate that DualBreach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer queries, achieving significantly higher success rates across all settings. More specifically, DualBreach achieves an average dual-jailbreaking success rate of 93.67% against GPT-4 with Llama-Guard-3 protection, whereas the best success rate achieved by other methods is 88.33%. Moreover, DualBreach only uses an average of 1.77 queries per successful dual-jailbreak, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. For the purpose of defense, we propose an XGBoost-based ensemble defensive mechanism named EGuard, which integrates the strengths of multiple guardrails, demonstrating superior performance compared with Llama-Guard-3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sid Black, Asa Cooper Stickland, Jake Pencharz, Oliver Sourbut, Michael Schmatz, Jay Bailey, Ollie Matthews, Ben Millwood, Alex Remedios, Alan Cooney</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent and evolving threat to modern networked systems, capable of causing large-scale service disruptions. The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within high-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and intelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional methods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each offer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack environments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a detailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to large-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method that leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative features. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively ranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental evaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only improves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational efficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality. These results point to the potential of integrating generative learning models into cybersecurity pipelines to build more adaptive and scalable detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanchen Wu, Linzhi Zheng, Han Xie, Zhen Xiang, Jiaying Lu, Darren Liu, Delgersuren Bold, Bo Li, Xiao Hu, Carl Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The de-identification of private information in medical data is a crucial process to mitigate the risk of confidentiality breaches, particularly when patient personal details are not adequately removed before the release of medical records. Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing patient privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviv Bick, Eric Xing, Albert Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: SSMs offer efficient processing of long sequences with fixed state sizes, but struggle with algorithmic tasks like retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model types, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example, disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar G&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the significance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs manifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus, while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example, in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&A head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Evtimov, Arman Zharmagambetov, Aaron Grattafiori, Chuan Guo, Kamalika Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Web navigation AI agents use language-and-vision foundation models to enhance productivity but these models are known to be susceptible to indirect prompt injections that get them to follow instructions different from the legitimate user's. Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the live web. As part of WASP, we also develop baseline attacks against three popular web agentic systems (VisualWebArena, Claude Computer Use, and Operator) instantiated with various state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation shows that even AI agents backed by models with advanced reasoning capabilities and by models with instruction hierarchy mitigations are susceptible to low-effort human-written prompt injections. However, the realistic objectives in WASP also allow us to observe that agents are currently not capable enough to complete the goals of attackers end-to-end. Agents begin executing the adversarial instruction between 16 and 86% of the time but only achieve the goal between 0 and 17% of the time. Based on these findings, we argue that adversarial researchers should demonstrate stronger attacks that more consistently maintain control over the agent given realistic constraints on the adversary's power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianbing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models such as OpenAI's O1 and O3, along with DeepSeek's R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capacities and problem-solving skills acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), with wide applications in mathematics, coding, science, intelligent agents, and virtual assistants. In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover, models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic quality of service (QoS) data exhibit rich temporal patterns in user-service interactions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and service conditions in Web service. As the number of users and services increases, there is a large amount of unobserved QoS data, which significantly affects users'choice of services. To predict unobserved QoS data, we propose a Non-negative Snowflake Factorization of tensors model. This method designs a snowflake core tensor to enhance the model's learning capability. Additionally, it employs a single latent factor-based, nonnegative multiplication update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) for parameter learning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately learns dynamic user-service interaction patterns, thereby yielding improved predictions for missing QoS data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Catalani, Michael Bauerheim, Fr\'ed\'eric Tost, Xavier Bertrand, Joseph Morlier</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful, discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries. Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art graph based, operator learning, and neural field methods. Notably, our method supports real time inference and zero-shot super-resolution, enabling efficient training on low-resolution meshes while maintaining high accuracy on full-scale discretizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant global health burden, where precise severity assessment is particularly critical for effective clinical management in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. This study introduces an innovative machine learning framework for COPD severity classification utilizing the MIMIC-III critical care database, thereby expanding the applications of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine. Our research developed a robust classification model incorporating key ICU parameters such as blood gas measurements and vital signs, while implementing semi-supervised learning techniques to effectively utilize unlabeled data and enhance model performance. The random forest classifier emerged as particularly effective, demonstrating exceptional discriminative capability with 92.51% accuracy and 0.98 ROC AUC in differentiating between mild-to-moderate and severe COPD cases. This machine learning approach provides clinicians with a practical, accurate, and efficient tool for rapid COPD severity evaluation in ICU environments, with significant potential to improve both clinical decision-making processes and patient outcomes. Future research directions should prioritize external validation across diverse patient populations and integration with clinical decision support systems to optimize COPD management in critical care settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongrui Su, Qingbin Li, Shengyu Zhu, Wei Chen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of transfer-based black-box attack, where adversarial samples generated using a single surrogate model are directly applied to target models. Compared with untargeted attacks, existing methods still have lower Attack Success Rates (ASRs) in the targeted setting, i.e., the obtained adversarial examples often overfit the surrogate model but fail to mislead other models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the pixels or features in these adversarial examples collaborate in a highly dependent manner to maximize the success of an adversarial attack on the surrogate model, which we refer to as perturbation co-adaptation. Then, we propose to Mitigate perturbation Co-adaptation by DropConnect (MCD) to enhance transferability, by creating diverse variants of surrogate model at each optimization iteration. We conduct extensive experiments across various CNN- and Transformer-based models to demonstrate the effectiveness of MCD. In the challenging scenario of transferring from a CNN-based model to Transformer-based models, MCD achieves 13% higher average ASRs compared with state-of-the-art baselines. MCD boosts the performance of self-ensemble methods by bringing in more diversification across the variants while reserving sufficient semantic information for each variant. In addition, MCD attains the highest performance gain when scaling the compute of crafting adversarial examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Environmental biotechnologies, such as drinking water biofilters, rely on complex interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding physical-chemical environments. Predicting the performance of these systems is challenging due to high-dimensional, sparse datasets that lack diversity and fail to fully capture system behaviour. Accurate predictive models require innovative, science-guided approaches. In this study, we present the first application of Buckingham Pi theory to modelling biofilter performance. This dimensionality reduction technique identifies meaningful, dimensionless variables that enhance predictive accuracy and improve model interpretability. Using these variables, we developed the Environmental Buckingham Pi Neural Network (EnviroPiNet), a physics-guided model benchmarked against traditional data-driven methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoder neural networks. Our findings demonstrate that the EnviroPiNet model achieves an R^2 value of 0.9236 on the testing dataset, significantly outperforming PCA and autoencoder methods. The Buckingham Pi variables also provide insights into the physical and chemical relationships governing biofilter behaviour, with implications for system design and optimization. This study highlights the potential of combining physical principles with AI approaches to model complex environmental systems characterized by sparse, high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyue Wang, Qi Pang, Xixun Lin, Shuai Wang, Daoyuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have emerged as a powerful architecture for
  large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient scaling of model capacity
  while maintaining manageable computational costs. The key advantage lies in
  their ability to route different tokens to different ``expert'' networks
  within the model, enabling specialization and efficient handling of diverse
  input. However, the vulnerabilities of MoE-based LLMs still have barely been
  studied, and the potential for backdoor attacks in this context remains
  largely unexplored. This paper presents the first backdoor attack against
  MoE-based LLMs where the attackers poison ``dormant experts'' (i.e., underutilized
  experts) and activate them by optimizing routing triggers, thereby gaining
  control over the model's output. We first rigorously prove the existence of a few ``dominating
  experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the overall MoE's
  output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating experts to manipulate model predictions.
  Accordingly, our attack, namely \textsc{BadMoE}, exploits the unique
  architecture of MoE models by 1) identifying dormant experts unrelated to the target task, 2)
  constructing a routing-aware loss to optimize the activation triggers of these experts, and 3) promoting dormant experts to dominating roles via poisoned training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Koralus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of rapidly advancing AI technology, individuals will increasingly rely on AI agents to navigate life's growing complexities, raising critical concerns about maintaining both human agency and autonomy. This paper addresses a fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either becoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having autonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent of ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of choice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes, initially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to erode autonomy. To counteract this risk, the paper proposes a philosophic turn in AI design. AI should be constructed to facilitate decentralized truth-seeking and open-ended inquiry, mirroring the Socratic method of philosophical dialogue. By promoting individual and collective adaptive learning, such AI systems would empower users to maintain control over their judgments, augmenting their agency without undermining autonomy. The paper concludes by outlining essential features for autonomy-preserving AI systems, sketching a path toward AI systems that enhance human judgment rather than undermine it.</p>

This graph represents student actions, learning resources, and relationships, aiming to enable reasoning about effective learning pathways. We describe the implementation of the system, highlighting the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented, including introducing a dual-agent architecture where tasks are separated, all coordinated through a central knowledge graph that maintains system awareness, and a user-facing tag system intended to mitigate LLM hallucination and improve user control. Preliminary results illustrate the system's potential to capture rich interaction data, dynamically adapt lesson plans based on student feedback via a tag system in simulation, and facilitate context-aware tutoring through the integrated knowledge graph, though systematic evaluation is required.</p>

To address this critical gap, we propose a novel phishing URL detection system based on a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference model optimized through gradient-based techniques. Our approach intelligently combines the interpretability and human-like reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic with the precision and adaptability provided by gradient optimization methods, specifically leveraging the Adam optimizer for efficient parameter tuning. Experiments conducted using a comprehensive dataset of over 235,000 URLs demonstrate rapid convergence, exceptional predictive performance (accuracy averaging 99.95% across 5 cross-validation folds, with a perfect AUC i.e. 1.00). Furthermore, optimized fuzzy rules and membership functions improve interoperability, clearly indicating how the model makes decisions - an essential feature for cybersecurity applications. This high-performance, transparent, and interpretable phishing detection framework significantly advances current cybersecurity defenses, providing practitioners with accurate and explainable decision-making tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Singh, Mahua Singh, Abhinav Bhatele</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate the current state of collective communication on GPU-based supercomputers for large language model (LLM) training at scale. Existing libraries such as RCCL and Cray-MPICH exhibit critical limitations on systems such as Frontier -- Cray-MPICH underutilizes network and compute resources, while RCCL suffers from severe scalability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce PCCL, a communication library with highly optimized implementations of all-gather and reduce-scatter operations tailored for distributed deep learning workloads. PCCL is designed to maximally utilize all available network and compute resources and to scale efficiently to thousands of GPUs. It achieves substantial performance improvements, delivering 6-33x speedups over RCCL and 28-70x over Cray-MPICH for all-gather on 2048 GCDs of Frontier. These gains translate directly to end-to-end performance: in large-scale GPT-3-style training, PCCL provides up to 60% and 40% speedups over RCCL for 7B and 13B parameter models, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Sliwowski, Dongheui Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries, with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast, computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras. Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models. Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nader Zantout, Haochen Zhang, Pujith Kachana, Jinkai Qiu, Ji Zhang, Wenshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apoorva Beedu, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: Video summarization creates an abridged version (i.e., a summary) that provides a quick overview of the video while retaining pertinent information. In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS, Mr.HiSum, and the WikiHow test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization on the target datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background and Context. The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) in computing education presents an emerging challenge in understanding how students use LLMs and craft prompts to solve computational tasks. Prior research has used both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze prompting behavior, but these approaches lack scalability or fail to effectively capture the semantic evolution of prompts. Objective. In this paper, we investigate whether students prompts can be systematically analyzed using propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can identify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide insights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce Prompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into logical constraints. The constraints are able to represent the intent of the prompts in succinct and quantifiable ways. We used this approach to analyze a dataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming tasks. Findings. We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend to use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often modify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies midway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most helpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications. This work offers a new and scalable way to detect students who struggle in solving natural language programming tasks. This work could be extended to investigate more complex tasks and integrated into programming tools to provide real-time support.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the US tax law evolves to adapt to ever-changing politico-economic realities, tax preparation software plays a significant role in helping taxpayers navigate these complexities. The dynamic nature of tax regulations poses a significant challenge to accurately and timely maintaining tax software artifacts. The state-of-the-art in maintaining tax prep software is time-consuming and error-prone as it involves manual code analysis combined with an expert interpretation of tax law amendments. We posit that the rigor and formality of tax amendment language, as expressed in IRS publications, makes it amenable to automatic translation to executable specifications (code). Our research efforts focus on identifying, understanding, and tackling technical challenges in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Llama, to faithfully extract code differentials from IRS publications and automatically integrate them with the prior version of the code to automate tax prep software maintenance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashutosh Nema, Samaksh Gulati, Evangelos Giakoumakis, Bipana Thapaliya</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to their popularity across multiple use-cases. However, prompt engineering, the process for optimally utilizing such models, remains approximation-driven and subjective. Most of the current research on prompt engineering focuses on task-specific optimization, while neglecting the behavior of the LLM under consideration during prompt development. This paper introduces MODP -- Multi Objective Directional Prompting, a framework based on two key concepts: 1) multi-objectivity: the importance of considering an LLM's intrinsic behavior as an additional objective in prompt development, and 2) directional prompting: a metrics-driven method for prompt engineering to ensure development of robust and high-precision prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ideas on a summarization task, using a synthetically created dataset, achieving a 26% performance gain over initial prompts. Finally, we apply MODP to develop prompts for Dell's Next Best Action support tool, which is now in production and is used by more than 10,000 internal support agents and serving millions of customers worldwide.</p>

What can we do to know our food more and control it better? To give us a clue, we are trying to build a World Food Atlas (WFA) that collects all the knowledge about food in the world. In this paper, we present two of our trials. The first is the Food Knowledge Graph (FKG), which is a graphical representation of knowledge about food and ingredient relationships derived from recipes and food nutrition data. The second is the FoodLog Athl and the RecipeLog that are applications for collecting people's detailed records about food habit. We also discuss several problems that we try to solve to build the WFA by integrating these two ideas.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor. This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates, underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior. Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient model adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from severe sample inefficiency, especially during early training, requiring extensive environmental interactions to perform competently. Existing methods tend to solve this by incorporating prior knowledge, but introduce significant architectural and implementation complexity. We propose Dynamic Action Interpolation (DAI), a universal yet straightforward framework that interpolates expert and RL actions via a time-varying weight $\alpha(t)$, integrating into any Actor-Critic algorithm with just a few lines of code and without auxiliary networks or additional losses. Our theoretical analysis shows that DAI reshapes state visitation distributions to accelerate value function learning while preserving convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations across MuJoCo continuous control tasks demonstrate that DAI improves early-stage performance by over 160\% on average and final performance by more than 50\%, with the Humanoid task showing a 4$\times$ improvement early on and a 2$\times$ gain at convergence. These results challenge the assumption that complex architectural modifications are necessary for sample-efficient reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of transformer models in NLP, and image and video classification, the available tools for extracting features from captured IoT network flow packets fail to capture sequential patterns in addition to the absence of spatial patterns consequently limiting transformer model application. This work introduces a novel preprocessing method to adapt transformer models, the vision transformer (ViT) in particular, for IoT botnet attack detection using network flow packets. The approach involves feature extraction from .pcap files and transforming each instance into a 1-channel 2D image shape, enabling ViT-based classification. Also, the ViT model was enhanced to allow use any classifier besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that was deployed in the initial ViT paper. Models including the conventional feed forward Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM) demonstrated competitive performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score for multiclass-based attack detection when evaluated on two IoT attack datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Takizawa, Satoshi Kodera, Tempei Kabayama, Ryo Matsuoka, Yuta Ando, Yuto Nakamura, Haruki Settai, Norihiko Takeda</p>
<p>Abstract: Echocardiography involves recording videos of the heart using ultrasound, enabling clinicians to evaluate its condition. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered attention for automating the interpretation of echocardiographic videos. However, most existing VLMs proposed for medical interpretation thus far rely on single-frame (i.e., image) inputs. Consequently, these image-based models often exhibit lower diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable through cardiac motion. Moreover, echocardiographic videos are recorded from various views that depend on the direction of ultrasound emission, and certain views are more suitable than others for interpreting specific conditions. Incorporating multiple views could potentially yield further improvements in accuracy. In this study, we developed a video-language model that takes five different views and full video sequences as input, training it on pairs of echocardiographic videos and clinical reports from 60,747 cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this expanded approach achieves higher interpretation accuracy than models trained with only single-view videos or with still images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bug reports contain the information developers need to triage and fix software bugs. However, unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous information may lead to delays and excessive manual effort spent on bug triage and resolution. In this paper, we explore whether Instruction fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically transform casual, unstructured bug reports into high-quality, structured bug reports adhering to a standard template. We evaluate three open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (\emph{Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and Llama 3.2}) against ChatGPT-4o, measuring performance on established metrics such as CTQRS, ROUGE, METEOR, and SBERT. Our experiments show that fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 achieves a CTQRS score of \textbf{77%}, outperforming both fine-tuned Mistral (\textbf{71%}), Llama 3.2 (\textbf{63%}) and ChatGPT in 3-shot learning (\textbf{75%}). Further analysis reveals that Llama 3.2 shows higher accuracy of detecting missing fields particularly Expected Behavior and Actual Behavior, while Qwen 2.5 demonstrates superior performance in capturing Steps-to-Reproduce, with an F1 score of 76%. Additional testing of the models on other popular projects (e.g., Eclipse, GCC) demonstrates that our approach generalizes well, achieving up to \textbf{70%} CTQRS in unseen projects' bug reports. These findings highlight the potential of instruction fine-tuning in automating structured bug report generation, reducing manual effort for developers and streamlining the software maintenance process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework, grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation. Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators' quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated videos will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant challenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image. The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video generation compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelaziz Amara korba, Nour Elislem Karabadji, Yacine Ghamri-Doudane</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is transforming transportation by enhancing connectivity and enabling autonomous driving. However, this increased interconnectivity introduces new security vulnerabilities. Bot malware and cyberattacks pose significant risks to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), as demonstrated by real-world incidents involving remote vehicle system compromise. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to and from CAVs. Our detection model is based on a meta-ensemble classifier capable of recognizing known (Nday) attacks and detecting previously unseen (zero-day) attacks. The approach involves training multiple Isolation Forest (IF) models on Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with each IF specialized in identifying a specific type of botnet attack. These IFs, either trained locally or shared by other MEC nodes, are then aggregated using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based stacking strategy to construct a robust meta-classifier. The proposed IDS has been evaluated on a vehicular botnet dataset, achieving an average detection rate of 92.80% for N-day attacks and 77.32% for zero-day attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our solution in detecting both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and adaptive defense mechanism for CAVs within the IoV ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Wasswa, Aziida Nanyonga, Timothy Lynar</p>
<p>Abstract: AI models have garnered significant research attention towards predictive task automation. However, a stationary training environment is an underlying assumption for most models and such models simply do not work on non-stationary data since a stationary relationship is learned. The existing solutions propose making data stationary prior to model training and evaluation. This leads to loss of trend and seasonal patterns which are vital components for learning temporal dependencies of the system under study. This research aims to address this limitation by proposing a method for enforcing stationary behaviour within the latent space while preserving trend and seasonal information. The method deploys techniques including Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), to learn information vital for efficient approximation of trend and seasonal information which is then stored as embeddings within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The approach's ability to preserve trend and seasonal information was evaluated on two time-series non-stationary datasets. For predictive performance evaluation, four deep learning models were trained on the latent vector representations of the datasets after application of the proposed method and all models produced competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques using RMSE as the performance metric.</p>

Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Ali Ferah, Tufan Kumbasar</p>
<p>Abstract: System Identification (SysID) is crucial for modeling and understanding dynamical systems using experimental data. While traditional SysID methods emphasize linear models, their inability to fully capture nonlinear dynamics has driven the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) as a more powerful alternative. However, the lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in DL-based models poses challenges for reliability and safety, highlighting the necessity of incorporating UQ. This paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing and learning Interval Neural Networks (INNs) to perform UQ in SysID tasks. INNs are derived by transforming the learnable parameters (LPs) of pre-trained neural networks into interval-valued LPs without relying on probabilistic assumptions. By employing interval arithmetic throughout the network, INNs can generate Prediction Intervals (PIs) that capture target coverage effectively. We extend Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) into Interval LSTM (ILSTM) and Interval NODE (INODE) architectures, providing the mathematical foundations for their application in SysID. To train INNs, we propose a DL framework that integrates a UQ loss function and parameterization tricks to handle constraints arising from interval LPs. We introduce novel concept "elasticity" for underlying uncertainty causes and validate ILSTM and INODE in SysID experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hidayet Ersin Dursun, Yusuf G\"uven, Tufan Kumbasar</p>
<p>Abstract: This work focuses on the design of a deep learning-based autonomous driving system deployed and tested on the real-world MIT Racecar to assess its effectiveness in driving scenarios. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) translates raw image inputs into real-time steering commands in an end-to-end learning fashion, following the imitation learning framework. The key design challenge is to ensure that DNN predictions are accurate and fast enough, at a high sampling frequency, and result in smooth vehicle operation under different operating conditions. In this study, we design and compare various DNNs, to identify the most effective approach for real-time autonomous driving. In designing the DNNs, we adopted an incremental design approach that involved enhancing the model capacity and dataset to address the challenges of real-world driving scenarios. We designed a PD system, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-NODE, and evaluated their performance on the real-world MIT Racecar. While the PD system handled basic lane following, it struggled with sharp turns and lighting variations. The CNN improved steering but lacked temporal awareness, which the CNN-LSTM addressed as it resulted in smooth driving performance. The CNN-NODE performed similarly to the CNN-LSTM in handling driving dynamics, yet with slightly better driving performance. The findings of this research highlight the importance of iterative design processes in developing robust DNNs for autonomous driving applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Xing, Xiaodan Ren, Jie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Lu, Wanxu Zhao, Xin Zhou, Chenxin An, Chenglong Wang, Shuo Li, Yuming Yang, Jun Zhao, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to process and generate coherent context when the number of input tokens exceeds the pre-trained length. Recent advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions. Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension. We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of 128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER. When compared with commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with DPE even achieves better performance than GPT-4-128K.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18858">Why you shouldn&#x27;t fully trust ChatGPT: A synthesis of this AI tool&#x27;s error rates across disciplines and the software engineering lifecycle</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Garousi</p>
<p>Abstract: Context: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) are widely used across healthcare, business, economics, engineering, and software engineering (SE). Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
  Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).
  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions.
  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability.
  Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a temporal feature encoding architecture called Time Series Representation Model (TSRM) for multivariate time series forecasting and imputation. The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/RobertLeppich/TSRM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Ju, Reinmar J. Kobler, Antoine Collas, Motoaki Kawanabe, Cuntai Guan, Bertrand Thirion</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuroimaging provides a critical framework for characterizing brain activity by quantifying connectivity patterns and functional architecture across modalities. While modern machine learning has significantly advanced our understanding of neural processing mechanisms through these datasets, decoding task-specific signatures must contend with inherent neuroimaging constraints, for example, low signal-to-noise ratios in raw electrophysiological recordings, cross-session non-stationarity, and limited sample sizes. This review focuses on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where often symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices under full-rank conditions encode inter-channel relationships. By equipping the space of SPD matrices with Riemannian metrics (e.g., affine-invariant or log-Euclidean), their space forms a Riemannian manifold enabling geometric analysis. We unify methodologies operating on this manifold under the SPD learning framework, which systematically leverages the SPD manifold's geometry to process covariance features, thereby advancing brain imaging analytics.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions tailored to the limits and characteristics of the different application scenarios. In this study, we investigate how multiple state-of-the-art 3DFR algorithms can be used to generate a better representation of subjects, with the final goal of improving the performance of face recognition systems in challenging uncontrolled scenarios. We also explore how different parametric and non-parametric score-level fusion methods can exploit the unique strengths of multiple 3DFR algorithms to enhance biometric recognition robustness. With this goal, we propose a comprehensive analysis of several face recognition systems across diverse conditions, such as varying distances and camera setups, intra-dataset and cross-dataset, to assess the robustness of the proposed ensemble method. The results demonstrate that the distinct information provided by different 3DFR algorithms can alleviate the problem of generalizing over multiple application scenarios. In addition, the present study highlights the potential of advanced fusion strategies to enhance the reliability of 3DFR-based face recognition systems, providing the research community with key insights to exploit them in real-world applications effectively. Although the experiments are carried out in a specific face verification setup, our proposed fusion-based 3DFR methods may be applied to other tasks around face biometrics that are not strictly related to identity recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyril Shih-Huan Hsu, Anestis Dalgkitsis, Chrysa Papagianni, Paola Grosso</p>
<p>Abstract: In the forthcoming era of 6G networks, characterized by unprecedented data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive connectivity, effective management of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is essential. VNFs are software-based counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and scalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and convergence using $\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of next-generation networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarang S, Druva Dhakshinamoorthy, Aditya Shiva Sharma, Yuvraj Singh Bhadauria, Siddharth Chaitra Vivek, Arihant Bansal, Arnab K. Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called \proj, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. \proj provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that \proj achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Global healthcare providers are exploring use of large language models (LLMs) to provide medical advice to the public. LLMs now achieve nearly perfect scores on medical licensing exams, but this does not necessarily translate to accurate performance in real-world settings. We tested if LLMs can assist members of the public in identifying underlying conditions and choosing a course of action (disposition) in ten medical scenarios in a controlled study with 1,298 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive assistance from an LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) or a source of their choice (control). Tested alone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately, correctly identifying conditions in 94.9% of cases and disposition in 56.3% on average. However, participants using the same LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases and disposition in less than 44.2%, both no better than the control group. We identify user interactions as a challenge to the deployment of LLMs for medical advice. Standard benchmarks for medical knowledge and simulated patient interactions do not predict the failures we find with human participants. Moving forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate interactive capabilities prior to public deployments in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruifeng Ren, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of Transformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a criterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often remains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression and to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of the target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is typically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In this work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We find that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression: beyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning lower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the model size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly aligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its information content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical role in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational redundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within their parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through dynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers, particularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for this, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing attention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of active neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger models strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy and dynamic sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianwei Chen, Yaobang Gong, Xianfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Advanced Driving Systems (ADS) are key to improving road safety, yet most existing implementations focus primarily on the vehicle ahead, neglecting the behavior of following vehicles. This shortfall often leads to chain reaction collisions in high speed, densely spaced traffic particularly when a middle vehicle suddenly brakes and trailing vehicles cannot respond in time. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel longitudinal control and collision avoidance algorithm that integrates adaptive cruising with emergency braking. Leveraging deep reinforcement learning, our method simultaneously accounts for both leading and following vehicles. Through a data preprocessing framework that calibrates real-world sensor data, we enhance the robustness and reliability of the training process, ensuring the learned policy can handle diverse driving conditions. In simulated high risk scenarios (e.g., emergency braking in dense traffic), the algorithm effectively prevents potential pile up collisions, even in situations involving heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, in typical highway scenarios where three vehicles decelerate, the proposed DRL approach achieves a 99% success rate far surpassing the standard Federal Highway Administration speed concepts guide, which reaches only 36.77% success under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs enable chatbots to interact with individuals on a range of queries, including sensitive mental health contexts. Despite uncertainties about their effectiveness and reliability, the development of LLMs in these areas is growing, potentially leading to harms. To better identify and mitigate these harms, it is critical to understand how the values of people with lived experiences relate to the harms. In this study, we developed a technology probe, a GPT-4o based chatbot called Zenny, enabling participants to engage with depression self-management scenarios informed by previous research. We used Zenny to interview 17 individuals with lived experiences of depression. Our thematic analysis revealed key values: informational support, emotional support, personalization, privacy, and crisis management. This work explores the relationship between lived experience values, potential harms, and design recommendations for mental health AI chatbots, aiming to enhance self-management support while minimizing risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Building on these findings, we propose a set of design suggestions, rooted in empirical observations, that align AI assistance with human goals of clarity, completeness, creativity, and efficiency, through hybrid planning, adaptive execution, and decision-point support. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems.

In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of other formal methods (FM) workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahar Ramezani Jolfaei, Sepehr Khodadadi Hossein Abadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the application of the Brain Drain Optimization algorithm -- a swarm-based metaheuristic inspired by the emigration of intellectual elites -- to the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial optimization problem, serves as a challenge for applying the BRADO. A designed cost function guides the search, and the configurations are tuned using a TOPSIS-based multicriteria decision making process. BRADO consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of solution quality, achieving fewer threats and better objective function values. To assess BRADO's efficacy, it is benchmarked against several established metaheuristic algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), and basic Local Search (LS). The study highlights BRADO's potential as a general-purpose solver for combinatorial problems, opening pathways for future applications in other domains of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Mezzina, Pieter De Backer, Tom Vercauteren, Matthew Blaschko, Alexandre Mottrie, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Automated Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to segment the surgical workflow into its key events, functioning as a building block for efficient video review, surgical education as well as skill assessment. Previous research has focused on short and linear surgical procedures and has not explored if temporal context influences experts' ability to better classify surgical phases. This research addresses these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video snippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their confidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI architectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on the Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results: Video snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase classification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence in their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating phases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases. Conclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer vision, where both perform equally well when given the same context. Performance increases when temporal information is provided. Surgical tools and organs form the key landmarks for human interpretation and are expected to shape the future of automated SPR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\'ulia Vicens Figueres, Juliette Vanderhaeghen, Federica Bragone, Kateryna Morozovska, Khemraj Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Akbar-Tajari, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Mohammad Mahmoody</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with societal standards is of increasing interest, as these models are still prone to adversarial jailbreaks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Identifying these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such exploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating adversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of Thoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly effective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than state-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success rate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality, human-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's parameters, making it a black-box attack. Unlike approaches constrained by tree-based reasoning, GoAT's reasoning is based on a more intricate graph structure. By making simultaneous attack paths aware of each other's progress, this dynamic framework allows a deeper integration and refinement of reasoning paths, significantly enhancing the collaborative exploration of adversarial vulnerabilities in LLMs. At a technical level, GoAT starts with a graph structure and iteratively refines it by combining and improving thoughts, enabling synergy between different thought paths. The code for our implementation can be found at: https://github.com/GoAT-pydev/Graph_of_Attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam, G\'abor Kert\'esz</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient text classification is essential for handling the increasing volume of academic publications. This study explores the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs), including BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT, fine-tuned on the Web of Science (WoS-46985) dataset for scientific text classification. To enhance performance, we augment the dataset by executing seven targeted queries in the WoS database, retrieving 1,000 articles per category aligned with WoS-46985's main classes. PLMs predict labels for this unlabeled data, and a hard-voting strategy combines predictions for improved accuracy and confidence. Fine-tuning on the expanded dataset with dynamic learning rates and early stopping significantly boosts classification accuracy, especially in specialized domains. Domain-specific models like SciBERT and BioBERT consistently outperform general-purpose models such as BERT. These findings underscore the efficacy of dataset augmentation, inference-driven label prediction, hard-voting, and fine-tuning techniques in creating robust and scalable solutions for automated academic text classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work addresses the need for enhanced accuracy and efficiency in speech command recognition systems, a critical component for improving user interaction in various smart applications. Leveraging the robust pretrained YAMNet model and transfer learning, this study develops a method that significantly improves speech command recognition. We adapt and train a YAMNet deep learning model to effectively detect and interpret speech commands from audio signals. Using the extensively annotated Speech Commands dataset (speech_commands_v0.01), our approach demonstrates the practical application of transfer learning to accurately recognize a predefined set of speech commands. The dataset is meticulously augmented, and features are strategically extracted to boost model performance. As a result, the final model achieved a recognition accuracy of 95.28%, underscoring the impact of advanced machine learning techniques on speech command recognition. This achievement marks substantial progress in audio processing technologies and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.</p>

VISUALCENT leverages centroid based bottom up keypoint detection paradigm and uses Keypoint Heatmap incorporating Disk Representation and KeyCentroid to identify the optimal keypoint coordinates. For the unified segmentation task, an explicit keypoint is defined as a dynamic centroid called MaskCentroid to swiftly cluster pixels to specific human instance during rapid changes in human body movement or significantly occluded environment. Experimental results on COCO and OCHuman datasets demonstrate VISUALCENTs accuracy and real time performance advantages, outperforming existing methods in mAP scores and execution frame rate per second.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nandan Joshi, Erhan Guven</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes, enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular design applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) into experimental nuclear and particle physics has driven significant progress in simulation and reconstruction workflows. However, traditional simulation frameworks such as Geant4 remain computationally intensive, especially for Cherenkov detectors, where simulating optical photon transport through complex geometries and reflective surfaces introduces a major bottleneck. To address this, we present an open, standalone fast simulation tool for Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov Light (DIRC) detectors, with a focus on the High-Performance DIRC (hpDIRC) at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our framework incorporates a suite of generative models tailored to accelerate particle identification (PID) tasks by offering a scalable, GPU-accelerated alternative to full Geant4-based simulations. Designed with accessibility in mind, our simulation package enables both DL researchers and physicists to efficiently generate high-fidelity large-scale datasets on demand, without relying on complex traditional simulation stacks. This flexibility supports the development and benchmarking of novel DL-driven PID methods. Moreover, this fast simulation pipeline represents a critical step toward enabling EIC-wide PID strategies that depend on virtually unlimited simulated samples, spanning the full acceptance of the hpDIRC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Billel Essaid, Hamza Kheddar, Noureddine Batel</p>
<p>Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) play a vital role in restoring hearing for individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss by directly stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals. While traditional coding strategies, such as the advanced combination encoder (ACE), have proven effective, they are constrained by their adaptability and precision. This paper investigates the use of deep learning (DL) techniques to generate electrodograms for CIs, presenting our model as an advanced alternative. We compared the performance of our model with the ACE strategy by evaluating the intelligibility of reconstructed audio signals using the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric. The results indicate that our model achieves a STOI score of 0.6031, closely approximating the 0.6126 score of the ACE strategy, and offers potential advantages in flexibility and adaptability. This study underscores the benefits of incorporating artificial intelligent (AI) into CI technology, such as enhanced personalization and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components, involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and breadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent view of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with the knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map future research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven character-animation technologies.

<p>Abstract: Clinical summarization is crucial in healthcare as it distills complex medical data into digestible information, enhancing patient understanding and care management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts, where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from discharge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models, enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework, ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks: categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses, surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have significantly advanced deep learning by enhancing feature representation through selective focus. However, existing approaches often independently model channel importance and spatial saliency, overlooking their inherent interdependence and limiting their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose MIA-Mind, a lightweight and modular Multidimensional Interactive Attention Mechanism, built upon the MindSpore framework. MIA-Mind jointly models spatial and channel features through a unified cross-attentive fusion strategy, enabling fine-grained feature recalibration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative datasets: on CIFAR-10, MIA-Mind achieves an accuracy of 82.9\%; on ISBI2012, it achieves an accuracy of 78.7\%; and on CIC-IDS2017, it achieves an accuracy of 91.9\%. These results validate the versatility, lightweight design, and generalization ability of MIA-Mind across heterogeneous tasks. Future work will explore the extension of MIA-Mind to large-scale datasets, the development of ada,ptive attention fusion strategies, and distributed deployment to further enhance scalability and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, especially the recent advancements in reasoning, such as o1 and o3, pushing the boundaries of AI. Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and coding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic expertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously crafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14 subdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that necessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank incorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and cutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results reveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose chat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current reasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption tasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and manipulating encrypted data. Through detailed analysis and error investigations, we provide several key observations that shed light on the limitations and potential improvement areas for LLMs in cryptographic reasoning. These findings underscore the need for continuous advancements in LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging.

VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiling Zheng, Xian Zhong, Bin Liu, Yi Xiao, Bihan Wen, Xiaofeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and the underutilization of spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific) components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency, and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Qu (Cheems),  Qi (Cheems),  Wang, Yixiu Mao, Yiqin Lv, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhao Xu, Chunyu Chen, Jinglin Peng, Jiannan Wang, Jun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most large enterprises build predefined data pipelines and execute them periodically to process operational data using SQL queries for various tasks. A key issue in minimizing the overall makespan of these pipelines is the efficient scheduling of concurrent queries within the pipelines. Existing tools mainly rely on simple heuristic rules due to the difficulty of expressing the complex features and mutual influences of queries. The latest reinforcement learning (RL) based methods have the potential to capture these patterns from feedback, but it is non-trivial to apply them directly due to the large scheduling space, high sampling cost, and poor sample utilization.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose BQSched, a non-intrusive Scheduler for Batch concurrent Queries via reinforcement learning. Specifically, BQSched designs an attention-based state representation to capture the complex query patterns, and proposes IQ-PPO, an auxiliary task-enhanced proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, to fully exploit the rich signals of Individual Query completion in logs. Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further introduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune the action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large query sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our knowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL. Extensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the efficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving remarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries. For example, across all DBMSs and scales tested, BQSched reduces the overall makespan of batch queries on TPC-DS benchmark by an average of 34% and 13%, compared with the commonly used heuristic strategy and the adapted RL-based scheduler, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussein Harb, Didier Benoit, Axel Rannou, Chi-Hieu Pham, Valentin Tissot, Bahaa Nasr, Julien Bert</p>
<p>Abstract: This study enhances Monte Carlo simulation accuracy in X-ray imaging by developing an AI-driven model for the anode heel effect, achieving improved beam intensity distribution and dosimetric precision. Through dynamic adjustments to beam weights on the anode and cathode sides of the X-ray tube, our machine learning model effectively replicates the asymmetry characteristic of clinical X-ray beams. Experimental results reveal dose rate increases of up to 9.6% on the cathode side and reductions of up to 12.5% on the anode side, for energy levels between 50 and 120 kVp. These experimentally optimized beam weights were integrated into the OpenGATE and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits, significantly advancing dosimetric simulation accuracy and the image quality which closely resembles the clinical imaging. Validation with fluence and dose actors demonstrated that the AI-based model closely mirrors clinical beam behavior, providing substantial improvements in dose consistency and accuracy over conventional X-ray models. This approach provides a robust framework for improving X-ray dosimetry, with potential applications in dose optimization, imaging quality enhancement, and radiation safety in both clinical and research settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Chen, Bang Zhang, Ruotian Ma, Peisong Wang, Xiaodan Liang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming state-of-the-art process reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandipan Dhar, Nanda Dulal Jana, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) stands as a crucial research area in speech synthesis, enabling the transformation of a speaker's vocal characteristics to resemble another while preserving the linguistic content. This technology has broad applications, including automated movie dubbing, speech-to-singing conversion, and assistive devices for pathological speech rehabilitation. With the increasing demand for high-quality and natural-sounding synthetic voices, researchers have developed a wide range of VC techniques. Among these, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches have drawn considerable attention for their powerful feature-mapping capabilities and potential to produce highly realistic speech. Despite notable advancements, challenges such as ensuring training stability, maintaining linguistic consistency, and achieving perceptual naturalness continue to hinder progress in GAN-based VC systems. This systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis of the voice conversion landscape, highlighting key techniques, key challenges, and the transformative impact of GANs in the field. The survey categorizes existing methods, examines technical obstacles, and critically evaluates recent developments in GAN-based VC. By consolidating and synthesizing research findings scattered across the literature, this review provides a structured understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches. The significance of this survey lies in its ability to guide future research by identifying existing gaps, proposing potential directions, and offering insights for building more robust and efficient VC systems. Overall, this work serves as an essential resource for researchers, developers, and practitioners aiming to advance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in voice conversion technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Nguyen, Naseem Khan, Issa Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake technology, particularly in instruction-guided image editing, threatens the integrity of digital images by enabling subtle, context-aware manipulations. Generated conditionally from real images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual, textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits, CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios. This approach establishes a powerful framework for countering sophisticated image manipulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Baumann, Leonardo Ayala, Silvia Seidlitz, Jan Sellner, Alexander Studier-Fischer, Berkin \"Ozdemir, Lena Maier-Hein, Slobodan Ilic</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Bouchard, Mohit Singh Chauhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad M Maheri, Hamed Haddadi, Alex Davidson</p>
<p>Abstract: Verification of the integrity of deep learning inference is crucial for understanding whether a model is being applied correctly. However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead.
  We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range.
  TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiren Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into film production has revolutionized efficiency and creativity, yet it simultaneously raises critical ethical and practical challenges. This study explores the dual impact of AI on modern cinema through three objectives: defining the optimal human-AI relationship, balancing creativity with automation, and developing ethical guidelines. By employing a mixed-method approach combining theoretical frameworks (auteur theory, human-technology relations) and case studies (The Safe Zone, Fast & Furious 7, The Brutalist), the research reveals that positioning AI as an "embodiment tool" rather than an independent "alterity partner" preserves human authorship and artistic integrity. Key findings highlight the risks of surveillance capitalism in AI-driven markets and the ethical dilemmas of deepfake technology. The study concludes with actionable recommendations, including international regulatory frameworks and a Human Control Index (HCI) to quantify AI involvement. These insights aim to guide filmmakers, policymakers, and scholars in navigating the evolving AI-cinema landscape while safeguarding cultural diversity and ethical standards.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment performance across four main applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and 16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements, executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads. In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems. NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves 31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p>

<p>Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art (SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy guardrail models. %
On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created, our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92} points over Aegis-LlamaGuard and \textbf{21.62} over \texttt{gpt-4o}, respectively.

In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.</p>

Even with state-of-the-art robot learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions, visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales, which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and scalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multi-modal contact sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitao Du, Shuning Chang, Jiasheng Tang, Yu Rong, Fan Wang, Shengchao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative learning paradigm, K-Flow, an algorithm that flows along the $K$-amplitude. Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the $K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective, K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the resolution of image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxuan Wang, Ray Yin, Yumei Tan, Hao Chen, Haiying Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious ocular complication of diabetes, is one of the primary causes of vision loss among retinal vascular diseases. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when applied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion structures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a plug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG models. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural representations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in both single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore, visualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with the intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling insights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean-R\'emy Conti, St\'ephan Cl\'emen\c{c}on</p>
<p>Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender, ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training. In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weidi Luo, Qiming Zhang, Tianyu Lu, Xiaogeng Liu, Yue Zhao, Zhen Xiang, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing capabilities of agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, such as ChatGPT o3, have raised critical concerns regarding privacy leakage through inadvertent image geolocation. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy (within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving private imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suping Xu, Chuyi Dai, Lin Shang, Changbin Shao, Xibei Yang, Witold Pedrycz</p>
<p>Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Tauhid Ullah Shah, Mohamad Hussein, Ann Barcomb, Mohammad Moshirpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing complex and regulated software projects. Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs' performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot) annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7, while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toby Simonds</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software engineering, but their application to physical engineering domains remains underexplored. This paper evaluates LLMs' capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through RocketBench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high-fidelity rocket simulations. We test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude optimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they struggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and ultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with reinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both SoTA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuxing Lu, Xin Yuan, Shaowen Yang, Jingyu Liu, Jiawei Wang, Changyin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction is essential for autonomous robots to perform complex interactions. Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with only marginal performance degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Chhikara, Dev Khant, Saket Aryan, Taranjeet Singh, Deshraj Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Dereich, Arnulf Jentzen, Adrian Riekert</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient descent based optimization methods are the methods of choice to train deep neural networks in machine learning. Beyond the standard gradient descent method, also suitable modified variants of standard gradient descent involving acceleration techniques such as the momentum method and/or adaptivity techniques such as the RMSprop method are frequently considered optimization methods. These days the most popular of such sophisticated optimization schemes is presumably the Adam optimizer that has been proposed in 2014 by Kingma and Ba. A highly relevant topic of research is to investigate the speed of convergence of such optimization methods. In particular, in 1964 Polyak showed that the standard gradient descent method converges in a neighborhood of a strict local minimizer with rate (x - 1)(x + 1)^{-1} while momentum achieves the (optimal) strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} - 1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-1} where x \in (1,\infty) is the condition number (the ratio of the largest and the smallest eigenvalue) of the Hessian of the objective function at the local minimizer. It is the key contribution of this work to reveal that Adam also converges with the strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} - 1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-1} while RMSprop only converges with the convergence rate (x - 1)(x + 1)^{-1}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Dong, Yuzhe Sun, Tianzhu Liu, Wangmeng Zuo, Yanfeng Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite imagery and maps, as two fundamental data modalities in remote sensing, offer direct observations of the Earth's surface and human-interpretable geographic abstractions, respectively. The task of bidirectional translation between satellite images and maps (BSMT) holds significant potential for applications in urban planning and disaster response. However, this task presents two major challenges: first, the absence of precise pixel-wise alignment between the two modalities substantially complicates the translation process; second, it requires achieving both high-level abstraction of geographic features and high-quality visual synthesis, which further elevates the technical complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthMapper, a novel autoregressive framework for controllable bidirectional satellite-map translation. EarthMapper employs geographic coordinate embeddings to anchor generation, ensuring region-specific adaptability, and leverages multi-scale feature alignment within a geo-conditioned joint scale autoregression (GJSA) process to unify bidirectional translation in a single training cycle. A semantic infusion (SI) mechanism is introduced to enhance feature-level consistency, while a key point adaptive guidance (KPAG) mechanism is proposed to dynamically balance diversity and precision during inference. We further contribute CNSatMap, a large-scale dataset comprising 302,132 precisely aligned satellite-map pairs across 38 Chinese cities, enabling robust benchmarking. Extensive experiments on CNSatMap and the New York dataset demonstrate EarthMapper's superior performance, achieving significant improvements in visual realism, semantic consistency, and structural fidelity over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, EarthMapper excels in zero-shot tasks like in-painting, out-painting and coordinate-conditional generation, underscoring its versatility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a universal chronic musculoskeletal disorders worldwide, making early diagnosis crucial. Currently, the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grading system is widely used to assess KOA severity. However, its high inter-observer variability and subjectivity hinder diagnostic consistency. To address these limitations, automated diagnostic techniques using deep learning have been actively explored in recent years. In this study, we propose a CLIP-based framework (CLIP-KOA) to enhance the consistency and reliability of KOA grade prediction. To achieve this, we introduce a learning approach that integrates image and text information and incorporate Symmetry Loss and Consistency Loss to ensure prediction consistency between the original and flipped images. CLIP-KOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.86\% on KOA severity prediction task, and ablation studies show that CLIP-KOA has 2.36\% improvement in accuracy over the standard CLIP model due to our contribution. This study shows a novel direction for data-driven medical prediction not only to improve reliability of fine-grained diagnosis and but also to explore multimodal methods for medical image analysis.

However, they are prone to contextual hallucination, generating information that is either unsubstantiated or contradictory to the given context. Although many studies have investigated contextual hallucinations in LLMs, addressing them in long-context inputs remains an open problem. In this work, we take an initial step toward solving this problem by constructing a dataset specifically designed for long-context hallucination detection. Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture that enables pre-trained encoder models, such as BERT, to process long contexts and effectively detect contextual hallucinations through a decomposition and aggregation mechanism. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms previous models of similar size as well as LLM-based models across various metrics, while providing substantially faster inference.</p>

  The framework integrates computer vision and machine learning techniques to track and interpret motion, allowing users to manipulate audio elements such as tempo, pitch, effects, and playback sequence. With ongoing training, it achieves user-independent functionality, requiring as few as 50 to 80 samples to label simple gestures. This framework combines gesture training, cue mapping, and audio manipulation to create a dynamic, interactive experience. Gestures are interpreted as input signals, mapped to sound control commands, and used to naturally adjust music elements, showcasing the seamless interplay between human interaction and machine response.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixiao Wei, Peng Yi, Jinlong Lei, Yiguang Hong, Yuchuan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated excellent decision-making potential in platoon coordination problems. However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average of 10\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bertram H{\o}jer, Oliver Jarvis, Stefan Heinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rudy Morel, Jiequn Han, Edouard Oyallon</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network, which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator). Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezeng Li, Zhihui Qi, Weimin Wang, Ziliang Wang, Junyi Duan, Na Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Quad meshes are essential in geometric modeling and computational mechanics. Although learning-based methods for triangle mesh demonstrate considerable advancements, quad mesh generation remains less explored due to the challenge of ensuring coplanarity, convexity, and quad-only meshes. In this paper, we present Point2Quad, the first learning-based method for quad-only mesh generation from point clouds. The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh with fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins with a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and squareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and topological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints, especially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a designed compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a quad-specific post-processing. Extensive experiments on both clear and noise data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of Point2Quad, compared to baseline methods under comprehensive metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Xiao, Xunxin Cai, Chengrui Wang, Yuanchun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical research has underscored the limitations of existing open-source annotated scientific corpora, which are often insufficient in quantity and quality. Addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Malashin, Daniil Ilyukhin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a concept of neural network specialization via task-specific domain constraining, aimed at enhancing network performance on data subspace in which the network operates. The study presents experiments on training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input. Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of the generalist network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Alvisi, Serena Tardelli, Maurizio Tesconi</p>
<p>Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing number of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set. Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with respect to post-processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dou Quan, Rufan Zhou, Shuang Wang, Ning Huyan, Dong Zhao, Yunan Li, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing image change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a dataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant differences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the trained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on other datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter network (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains dataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the discriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter model, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data distribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the deep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this paper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which can adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of labeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch normalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution differences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve satisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental results on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization ability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and better performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning methods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve high-quality image generation without adversarial training, but they process images as a whole. Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run Luo, Renke Shan, Longze Chen, Ziqiang Liu, Lu Wang, Min Yang, Xiaobo Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities. However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort. This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM, an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.</p>

<p>Abstract: - The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded within the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation. Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653">GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Davies, Baihua Li, Mohamad Saada, Simon S{\o}lvsten, Qinggang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Davies, Baihua Li, Mohamad Saada, Simon S{\o}lvsten, Qinggang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Sabih, Abrarul Karim, Jakob Wittmann, Frank Hannig, J\"urgen Teich</p>
<p>Abstract: The customizability of RISC-V makes it an attractive choice for accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). It can be achieved through instruction set extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and person detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Banf, Johannes Kuhn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT are emerging as a revolutionary tool in education that brings both positive aspects and challenges for educators and students, reshaping how learning and teaching are approached. This study aims to identify and evaluate the key competencies students need to effectively engage with GenAI in education and to provide strategies for lecturers to integrate GenAI into teaching practices. The study applied a mixed method approach with a combination of a literature review and a quantitative survey involving 130 students from South Asia and Europe to obtain its findings. The literature review identified 14 essential student skills for GenAI engagement, with AI literacy, critical thinking, and ethical AI practices emerging as the most critical. The student survey revealed gaps in prompt engineering, bias awareness, and AI output management. In our study of lecturer strategies, we identified six key areas, with GenAI Integration and Curriculum Design being the most emphasised. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating GenAI into education. While literature prioritized ethics and policy development, students favour hands-on, project-based learning and practical AI applications. To foster inclusive and responsible GenAI adoption, institutions should ensure equitable access to GenAI tools, establish clear academic integrity policies, and advocate for global GenAI research initiatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made progress and attracted academic interest, but it remains challenging to keep pace with the rapid integration of LLMs across diverse applications. Different applications expose users to various harms, necessitating application-specific safety evaluations with tailored harms and policies. Another major gap is the lack of focus on the dynamic and conversational nature of LLM systems. Such potential oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks. This paper identifies the above as key requirements for robust LLM safety evaluation and recognizing that current evaluation methodologies do not satisfy these, we introduce the $\texttt{SAGE}$ (Safety AI Generic Evaluation) framework. $\texttt{SAGE}$ is an automated modular framework designed for customized and dynamic harm evaluations. It utilizes adversarial user models that are system-aware and have unique personalities, enabling a holistic red-teaming evaluation. We demonstrate $\texttt{SAGE}$'s effectiveness by evaluating seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm policies. Our experiments with multi-turn conversational evaluations revealed a concerning finding that harm steadily increases with conversation length. Furthermore, we observe significant disparities in model behavior when exposed to different user personalities and scenarios. Our findings also reveal that some models minimize harmful outputs by employing severe refusal tactics that can hinder their usefulness. These insights highlight the necessity of adaptive and context-specific testing to ensure better safety alignment and safer deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric variations.

Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Generative AI have achieved remarkable progress, evolving into sophisticated and versatile tools widely adopted across various domains and applications. However, the substantial memory overhead caused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational demands of the attention mechanism, poses significant challenges in achieving low latency and high throughput for LLM inference services. Recent advancements, driven by groundbreaking research, have significantly accelerated progress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of these methods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level strategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important areas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling, decoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation paradigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment, multi-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging scenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and auxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several niche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to further advance the field of LLM inference serving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Merola, Jaspinder Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a transformative approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external knowledge sources. Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of external knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs? Traditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller, fixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often fragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence in generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late chunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to preserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths and limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late chunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual retrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater computational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency but tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Liver cirrhosis is an insidious condition involving the substitution of normal liver tissue with fibrous scar tissue and causing major health complications. The conventional method of diagnosis using liver biopsy is invasive and, therefore, inconvenient for use in regular screening.

The model integrates fixed blood test probabilities with deep learning model predictions (DenseNet-201) for ultrasonic images. The combined hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. The findings establish the viability of the combined model in enhancing diagnosis accuracy and supporting early intervention in liver disease care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtian Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress.
  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts.
  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhan Park, Kyungjae Lee, Hyung Jin Chang, Jungchan Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction (\textit{\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates segmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction task, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction (HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of autonomous robotic systems offers significant potential for performing complex tasks with precision and consistency. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled more capable intelligent automation systems, addressing increasingly complex challenges. However, this progress raises questions about human roles in such systems. Human-Centered AI (HCAI) aims to balance human control and automation, ensuring performance enhancement while maintaining creativity, mastery, and responsibility. For real-world applications, autonomous robots must balance task performance with reliability, safety, and trustworthiness. Integrating HCAI principles enhances human-robot collaboration and ensures responsible operation.
  This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of intelligent autonomous robotic systems, utilizing SciMAT and VOSViewer to examine data from the Scopus database. The findings highlight academic trends, emerging topics, and AI's role in self-adaptive robotic behaviour, with an emphasis on HCAI architecture. These insights are then projected onto the IBM MAPE-K architecture, with the goal of identifying how these research results map into actual robotic autonomous systems development efforts for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Yu Hung, Qi Sun, Pengfei Hong, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, U-Xuan Tan, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promising performance in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating impressive task execution and reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments, where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding. Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation. Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time robotic autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kienzle, Robin Sch\"on, Rainer Lienhart, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Zandieh, Majid Daliri, Majid Hadian, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Chen, Anne L. Martel</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\%) while retaining the robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods, providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights the potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable solution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: We establish the universal approximation capability of single-layer, single-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms with minimal attached structures. Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input domain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This allows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates the target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention layer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating any continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\infty$-norm. Furthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable function under $L_p$-norm for $1\leq p <\infty$. Lastly, we also extend our techniques and show that, for the first time, single-head cross-attention achieves the same universal approximation guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: The automatic summarization of surgical videos is essential for enhancing procedural documentation, supporting surgical training, and facilitating post-operative analysis. This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. %
The approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. %
We evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable clinical documentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigia Costabile, Gian Marco Orlando, Valerio La Gatta, Vincenzo Moscato</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias. Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making - can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for human crowds. Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles. Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and issue final veracity judgments.
  Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable, consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Bl\"aser, Julian D\"orfler, Maciej Li\'skiewicz, Benito van der Zander</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains, the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events $X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication (polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of (in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in complexity.
  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels. Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability under small-model constraints across different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents the novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to express the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear aircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based structure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional batch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and data noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic rule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different studies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data and the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling performance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts. Furthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared to Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the proposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are analyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in representing aerodynamic coefficients.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) multi-agent systems (MAS) necessitates standardized protocols enabling agents to discover and interact with external tools. However, these protocols introduce new security challenges, particularly; tool squatting; the deceptive registration or representation of tools. This paper analyzes tool squatting threats within the context of emerging interoperability standards, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) or seamless communication between agents protocols. It introduces a comprehensive Tool Registry system designed to mitigate these risks. We propose a security-focused architecture featuring admin-controlled registration, centralized tool discovery, fine grained access policies enforced via dedicated Agent and Tool Registry services, a dynamic trust scoring mechanism based on tool versioning and known vulnerabilities, and just in time credential provisioning. Based on its design principles, the proposed registry framework aims to effectively prevent common tool squatting vectors while preserving the flexibility and power of multi-agent systems.

This paper introduces a comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require a new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to account for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful new tool into a serious enterprise liability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adway Das, Agnimitra Sengupta, S. Ilgin Guler</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the interaction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep learning models often struggle with these challenges because their architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model. Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness and precision of traffic prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emre Can Acikgoz, Carl Guo, Suvodip Dey, Akul Datta, Takyoung Kim, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyhan Rayati, Amirhossein Feizi, Alireza Beigy, Pourya Shahverdi, Mehdi Tale Masouleh, Ahmad Kalhor</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for enabling real-time imitation of human head motion by a Nao robot, with a primary focus on elevating human-robot interactions. By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer vision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this research endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including blink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these indicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework which facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions, utilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback from the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high degree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2 score of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds promise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a valuable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work explores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion recognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for individuals with unique communication needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salem Lahlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning. The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload, highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks. It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Exogenous Organic Matter in agriculture necessitates monitoring to assess its effects on soil and crop health. This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the potential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective monitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and sustainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiongli Zhu, Yue Wang, Bailu Ding, Philip A. Bernstein, Vivek Narasayya, Surajit Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. In addition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for multi-modal and multi-feature scenarios today. In a multi-vector database, each row is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a high-dimensional vector. In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can have a significant impact on performance. Although index tuning for relational databases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search remains unclear and challenging. In this paper, we define multi-vector search index tuning and propose a framework to solve it. Specifically, given a multi-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that minimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints. Compared to the baseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Haoyang Li, Zeyang Zhang, Haibo Chen, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture that jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields with view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework. First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianqi Zhang, Xingtao Wang, Xu Liu, Wenrui Wang, Xiaopeng Fan, Debin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) have made great progress in robotic decision-making in recent years. However, these methods show obvious deterioration for new tasks that need to be completed through new combinations of actions. RL methods suffer from reward functions and distribution shifts, while IL methods are limited by expert demonstrations which do not cover new tasks. In contrast, humans can easily complete these tasks with the fragmented knowledge learned from task-agnostic experience. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a task-agnostic learning method (TAL for short) that can learn fragmented knowledge only from task-agnostic data to accomplish new tasks. TAL consists of four stages. First, the task-agnostic exploration is performed to collect data from interactions with the environment. The collected data is organized via a knowledge graph. Second, an action feature extractor is proposed and trained using the collected knowledge graph data for task-agnostic fragmented knowledge learning. Third, a candidate action generator is designed, which applies the action feature extractor on a new task to generate multiple candidate action sets. Finally, an action proposal network is designed to produce the probabilities for actions in a new task according to the environmental information. The probabilities are then used to generate order information for selecting actions to be executed from multiple candidate action sets to form the plan. Experiments on a virtual indoor scene show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL methods and IL methods by more than 20%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Iterated belief revision requires information about the current beliefs. This information is represented by mathematical structures called doxastic states. Most literature concentrates on how to revise a doxastic state and neglects that it may exponentially grow. This problem is studied for the most common ways of storing a doxastic state. All four methods are able to store every doxastic state, but some do it in less space than others. In particular, the explicit representation (an enumeration of the current beliefs) is the more wasteful on space. The level representation (a sequence of propositional formulae) and the natural representation (a history of natural revisions) are more compact than it. The lexicographic representation (a history of lexicographic revision) is even more compact than them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forgetting a belief acquisition episode may not cause information loss because of the others. Checking whether it does is not obvious, as the contribution of each belief revision is not isolated from the others, and the same information may be given not directly but by deduction. An algorithm for checking whether forgetting reduces information is given for a number of iterated belief revision operators: lexicographic, natural, severe, plain severe, moderate severe, restrained, very radical and full meet revisions. It may take exponential time in the worst case, which is expected given that the problem is coNP-hard, even in the Horn restriction. It is in coNP for homogeneous sequences of lexicographic revisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhang Feng, Siva Rajesh Kasa, Santhosh Kumar Kasa, Hyokun Yun, Choon Hui Teo, Sravan Babu Bodapati</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable natural language capabilities. However, when deploying them in real-world settings, it is important to align LLMs to generate texts according to acceptable human standards. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have enabled significant progress in refining LLMs using human preference data. However, the privacy concerns inherent in utilizing such preference data have yet to be adequately studied. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs aligned using two widely used methods - DPO and PPO - to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our study has two main contributions: first, we theoretically motivate that DPO models are more vulnerable to MIA compared to PPO models; second, we introduce a novel reference-based attack framework specifically for analyzing preference data called PREMIA (\uline{Pre}ference data \uline{MIA}). Using PREMIA and existing baselines we empirically show that DPO models have a relatively heightened vulnerability towards MIA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating realistic human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, as real data is often inaccessible to researchers due to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Truthfulness (adherence to factual accuracy) and utility (satisfying human needs and instructions) are both fundamental aspects of Large Language Models, yet these goals often conflict (e.g., sell a car with known flaws), which makes it challenging to achieve both in real-world deployments. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate these scenarios in an multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of real-world scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, though truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models can be directed to be truthful or deceptive, and even truth-steered models still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and LLM-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan An, Zhengru Fang, Yuang Zhang, Senkang Hu, Xianhao Chen, Guowen Xu, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have garnered significant attention due to their extended perception range and enhanced sensing coverage. To address challenges such as blind spots and obstructions, CAVs employ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to aggregate sensory data from surrounding vehicles. However, cooperative perception is often constrained by the limitations of achievable network throughput and channel quality. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware throughput maximization approach to facilitate CAV data fusion, leveraging a self-supervised autoencoder for adaptive data compression. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which we decompose into two sub-problems to derive optimal data rate and compression ratio solutions under given link conditions. An autoencoder is then trained to minimize bitrate with the determined compression ratio, and a fine-tuning strategy is employed to further reduce spectrum resource consumption. Experimental evaluation on the OpenCOOD platform demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing more than 20.19\% improvement in network throughput and a 9.38\% increase in average precision (AP@IoU) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with an optimal latency of 19.99 ms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel multiagent ensemble method powered by LLMs to address a key challenge in ML - data labeling, particularly in large-scale EHR datasets. Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its effectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG dataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from the clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of diverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's prediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal winning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for EHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language processing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an estimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify SDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving competitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can outperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces hallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs method significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling large-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality; (2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by its application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse LLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and (4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors. This approach provides a scalable and efficient solution to data-labeling challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Parashar, Aditya Vikram Singh, Avinash Amballa, Jinlin Lai, Benjamin Rozonoyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often equipped with multi-sample decoding strategies. An LLM implicitly defines an arithmetic code book, facilitating efficient and embarrassingly parallelizable \textbf{arithmetic sampling} to produce multiple samples using quasi-random codes. Traditional text generation methods, such as beam search and sampling-based techniques, have notable limitations: they lack parallelizability or diversity of sampled sequences. This study explores the potential of arithmetic sampling, contrasting it with ancestral sampling across two decoding tasks that employ multi-sample inference: chain-of-thought reasoning with self-consistency and machine translation with minimum Bayes risk decoding. Our results demonstrate that arithmetic sampling produces more diverse samples, significantly improving reasoning and translation performance as the sample size increases. We observe a $\mathbf{3\text{-}5\%}$ point increase in accuracy on the GSM8K dataset and a $\mathbf{0.45\text{-}0.89\%}$ point increment in COMET score for WMT19 tasks using arithmetic sampling without any significant computational overhead.</p>

By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a promising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects: task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures, making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive but integrated technical review on existing LIS frameworks. Specifically, we unify task definitions under Markov Decision Process (MDP) and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods. For ongoing paper updates, please refer to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/xinzhel/LLM-Search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingheng Tang, Wenbin Xu, Jie Cao, Weilu Gao, Steve Farrell, Benjamin Erichson, Michael W. Mahoney, Andy Nonaka, Zhi Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting the properties of inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating advancements in materials science and driving applications in energy, electronics, and beyond. Integrating material structure data with language-based information through multi-modal large language models (LLMs) offers great potential to support these efforts by enhancing human-AI interaction. However, a key challenge lies in integrating atomic structures at full resolution into LLMs. In this work, we introduce MatterChat, a versatile structure-aware multi-modal LLM that unifies material structural data and textual inputs into a single cohesive model. MatterChat employs a bridging module to effectively align a pretrained machine learning interatomic potential with a pretrained LLM, reducing training costs and enhancing flexibility. Our results demonstrate that MatterChat significantly improves performance in material property prediction and human-AI interaction, surpassing general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4. We also demonstrate its usefulness in applications such as more advanced scientific reasoning and step-by-step material synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jim Dai, Manxi Wu, Zhanhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pioneering companies such as Waymo have deployed robo-taxi services in several U.S. cities. These robo-taxis are electric vehicles, and their operations require the joint optimization of ride matching, vehicle repositioning, and charging scheduling in a stochastic environment. We model the operations of the ride-hailing system with robo-taxis as a discrete-time, average-reward Markov Decision Process with an infinite horizon. As the fleet size grows, dispatching becomes challenging, as both the system state space and the fleet dispatching action space grow exponentially with the number of vehicles. To address this, we introduce a scalable deep reinforcement learning algorithm, called Atomic Proximal Policy Optimization (Atomic-PPO), that reduces the action space using atomic action decomposition. We evaluate our algorithm using real-world NYC for-hire vehicle trip records and measure its performance by the long-run average reward achieved by the dispatching policy, relative to a fluid-based upper bound. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Atomic-PPO compared to benchmark methods. Furthermore, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to analyze the efficient allocation of charging facilities and assess the impact of vehicle range and charger speed on system performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Stephen White, Saad Hassan, Philip A Kalra, James Ritchie, Carl Diver, Jennie Shorley</p>
<p>Abstract: Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging.
  We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors.
  Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leading vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on general Internet content, overlooking scientific journals' rich, domain-specific knowledge. Training on specialty-specific literature could yield high-performance, task-specific tools, enabling generative AI to match generalist models in specialty publishing, educational, and clinical tasks. We created NeuroPubs, a multimodal dataset of 23,000 Neurosurgery Publications articles (134M words, 78K image-caption pairs). Using NeuroPubs, VLMs generated publication-ready graphical abstracts (70% of 100 abstracts) and board-style questions indistinguishable from human-written ones (54% of 89,587 questions). We used these questions to train CNS-Obsidian, a 34B-parameter VLM. In a blinded, randomized controlled trial, our model demonstrated non-inferiority to then state-of-the-art GPT-4o in neurosurgical differential diagnosis (clinical utility, 40.62% upvotes vs. 57.89%, p=0.1150; accuracy, 59.38% vs. 65.79%, p=0.3797). Our pilot study demonstrates how training generative AI models on specialty-specific journal content - without large-scale internet data - results in high-performance academic and clinical tools, enabling domain-tailored AI across diverse fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saman Khamesian, Asiful Arefeen, Stephanie M. Carpenter, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for overall health, yet many individuals struggle with meal planning due to nutritional complexity, time constraints, and lack of dietary knowledge. Personalized food recommendations can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve the lowest percentage errors of 1.55\% and 3.68\%, respectively, producing meal plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing deviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of DeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in personalized nutrition planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini, Hao Zhou, Irene Cai, Christopher D. Manning</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been shown to improve the performance of large language models. However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively. Excitingly, the approach exhibits generalization across tasks: for example, training only on HotPotQA (text question-answering) improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K (a math dataset) by a relative 16.9%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Jin, Liu Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning in partially observable environments has often been approached through passive predictive models, yet theories of embodied cognition suggest that genuinely useful representations arise only when perception is tightly coupled to action. Here we ask whether a recurrent agent, trained solely by sparse rewards to solve procedurally generated planar mazes, can autonomously internalize metric concepts such as direction, distance and obstacle layout. After training, the agent consistently produces near-optimal paths in unseen mazes, behavior that hints at an underlying spatial model. To probe this possibility, we cast the closed agent-environment loop as a hybrid dynamical system, identify stable limit cycles in its state space, and characterize behavior with a Ridge Representation that embeds whole trajectories into a common metric space. Canonical correlation analysis exposes a robust linear alignment between neural and behavioral manifolds, while targeted perturbations of the most informative neural dimensions sharply degrade navigation performance. Taken together, these dynamical, representational, and causal signatures show that sustained sensorimotor interaction is sufficient for the spontaneous emergence of compact, embodied world models, providing a principled path toward interpretable and transferable navigation policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawin Ethayarajh, Yejin Choi, Swabha Swayamdipta</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficulty -- w.r.t. a model $\mathcal{V}$ -- as the lack of $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ (Xu et al., 2019), where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for $\mathcal{V}$. We further introduce $\textit{pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-information}$ (PVI) for measuring the difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution. While standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset, $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ and PVI also permit the converse: for a given model $\mathcal{V}$, we can compare different datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same dataset. Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different input attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover annotation artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to enable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM), also known as Energy Disaggregation, through Bayesian Optimization. NIALM offers a cost-effective alternative to smart meters for measuring the energy consumption of electric devices and appliances. NIALM methods analyze the entire power consumption signal of a household and predict the type of appliances as well as their individual power consumption (i.e., their contributions to the aggregated signal). We enable NIALM domain experts and practitioners who typically have no deep data analytics or Machine Learning (ML) skills to benefit from state-of-the-art ML approaches to NIALM. Further, we conduct a survey and benchmarking of the state of the art and show that in many cases, simple and basic ML models and algorithms, such as Decision Trees, outperform the state of the art. Finally, we present our open-source tool, AutoML4NIALM, which will facilitate the exploitation of existing methods for NIALM in the industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John T\"ornblom, Emil Karlsson, Simin Nadjm-Tehrani</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to explain why a machine learning model arrives at a particular prediction is crucial when used as decision support by human operators of critical systems. The provided explanations must be provably correct, and preferably without redundant information, called minimal explanations. In this paper, we aim at finding explanations for predictions made by tree ensembles that are not only minimal, but also minimum with respect to a cost function.
  To this end, we first present a highly efficient oracle that can determine the correctness of explanations, surpassing the runtime performance of current state-of-the-art alternatives by several orders of magnitude when computing minimal explanations.
  Secondly, we adapt an algorithm called MARCO from related works (calling it m-MARCO) for the purpose of computing a single minimum explanation per prediction, and demonstrate an overall speedup factor of two compared to the MARCO algorithm which enumerates all minimal explanations.
  Finally, we study the obtained explanations from a range of use cases, leading to further insights of their characteristics. In particular, we observe that in several cases, there are more than 100,000 minimal explanations to choose from for a single prediction. In these cases, we see that only a small portion of the minimal explanations are also minimum, and that the minimum explanations are significantly less verbose, hence motivating the aim of this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Ye, Thai Le, Dongwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Online texts with toxic content are a clear threat to the users on social media in particular and society in general. Although many platforms have adopted various measures (e.g., machine learning-based hate-speech detection systems) to diminish their effect, toxic content writers have also attempted to evade such measures by using cleverly modified toxic words, so-called human-written text perturbations. Therefore, to help build automatic detection tools to recognize those perturbations, prior methods have developed sophisticated techniques to generate diverse adversarial samples. However, we note that these ``algorithms"-generated perturbations do not necessarily capture all the traits of ``human"-written perturbations. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset of human-written perturbations, named as NoisyHate, that was created from real-life perturbations that are both written and verified by human-in-the-loop. We show that perturbations in NoisyHate have different characteristics than prior algorithm-generated toxic datasets show, and thus can be in particular useful to help develop better toxic speech detection solutions. We thoroughly validate NoisyHate against state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, and black box APIs, such as Perspective API, on two tasks, such as perturbation normalization and understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses challenges for manual knowledge curation and synthesis. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines.
  We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs, GPT and LLaMA representatives on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero or few shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps. We find issues like missing information and hallucinations in LLM outputs. These results offer practical insights for applying LLMs in BioNLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Naganuma, Ryuichiro Hataya, Kotaro Yoshida, Ioannis Mitliagkas</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of computer vision, fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a prevalent strategy for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tasks. Different from most prior work that has focused on advancing learning algorithms, we systematically examined how pre-trained model size, pre-training dataset size, and training strategies impact generalization and confidence calibration on downstream tasks. We evaluated 100 models across diverse pre-trained model sizes, five pre-training datasets, and five data augmentations through extensive experiments on four distribution shift datasets totaling over 120,000 GPU hours. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of pre-trained model selection, with optimal choices substantially improving OOD accuracy over algorithm improvement alone. Additionally, we find that larger models and bigger pre-training datasets not only enhance OOD performance but also improve calibration, helping to mitigate overconfidence, contrary to some prior studies that found modern deep networks to calibrate worse than classical shallow models. Our work underscores the overlooked importance of pre-trained model selection for out-of-distribution generalization and calibration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This study aims to use machine learning approaches to analyze longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with AD and identify signs and symptoms that can predict AD onset earlier. We used a case-control design with longitudinal EHRs from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2004 to 2021. Cases were VHA patients with AD diagnosed after 1/1/2016 based on ICD-10-CM codes, matched 1:9 with controls by age, sex and clinical utilization with replacement. We used a panel of AD-related keywords and their occurrences over time in a patient's longitudinal EHRs as predictors for AD prediction with four machine learning models. We performed subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and validated the model in a hold-out and "unseen" VHA stations group. Model discrimination, calibration, and other relevant metrics were reported for predictions up to ten years before ICD-based diagnosis. The study population included 16,701 cases and 39,097 matched controls. The average number of AD-related keywords (e.g., "concentration", "speaking") per year increased rapidly for cases as diagnosis approached, from around 10 to over 40, while remaining flat at 10 for controls. The best model achieved high discriminative accuracy (ROCAUC 0.997) for predictions using data from at least ten years before ICD-based diagnoses. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.99) and consistent across subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity, except for patients younger than 65 (ROCAUC 0.746). Machine learning models using AD-related keywords identified from EHR notes can predict future AD diagnoses, suggesting its potential use for identifying AD risk using EHR notes, offering an affordable way for early screening on large population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianjun Gao, Yi Wang, Kim-Hui Yap, Kratika Garg, Boon Siew Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple pedestrian tracking is crucial for enhancing safety and efficiency in intelligent transport and autonomous driving systems by predicting movements and enabling adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. It optimizes traffic flow, facilitates human interaction, and ensures compliance with regulations. However, it faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in the presence of occlusion. Existing methods overlook effects caused by abnormal detections during partial occlusion. Subsequently, these abnormal detections can lead to inaccurate motion estimation, unreliable appearance features, and unfair association. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian tracker, OccluTrack, to mitigate the effects caused by partial occlusion. Specifically, we first introduce a plug-and-play abnormal motion suppression mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we develop a pose-guided re-identification (Re-ID) module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded pedestrians. Last, we develop a new occlusion-aware association method towards fair Intersection over Union (IoU) and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOTChallenge and DanceTrack datasets. Particularly, the performance improvements on IDF1 and ID Switches, as well as visualized results, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple pedestrian tracking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Louloudakis, Perry Gibson, Jos\'e Cano, Ajitha Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Converting deep learning models between frameworks is a common step to maximize model compatibility across devices and leverage optimization features that may be exclusively provided in one deep learning framework. However, this conversion process may be riddled with bugs, making the converted models either undeployable or problematic, considerably degrading their prediction correctness.
  In this paper, we propose an automated approach for fault localization and repair, FetaFix, during model conversion between deep learning frameworks. FetaFix is capable of detecting and fixing faults introduced in model input, parameters, hyperparameters, and the model graph during conversion. FetaFix uses a set of fault types (mined from surveying common conversion issues reported in code repositories and forums) to localize potential conversion faults in the converted target model and then repair them appropriately, e.g., replacing the parameters of the target model with those from the source model. This is done iteratively for every image in the dataset, comparing output label differences between the source model and the converted target model until all differences are resolved. We evaluate the effectiveness of FetaFix in fixing model conversion bugs of three widely used image recognition models converted across four different deep learning frameworks. Overall, FetaFix was able to fix $462$ out of $755$ detected conversion faults, either completely repairing or significantly improving the performance of $14$ out of the $15$ erroneous conversion cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Li, Yiming Dong, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Although adaptive gradient methods have been extensively used in deep learning, their convergence rates proved in the literature are all slower than that of SGD, particularly with respect to their dependence on the dimension. This paper considers the classical RMSProp and its momentum extension and establishes the convergence rate of $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^T E\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_1\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{T^{1/4}})$ measured by $\ell_1$ norm without the bounded gradient assumption, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization variable, $T$ is the iteration number, and $C$ is a constant identical to that appeared in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Our convergence rate matches the lower bound with respect to all the coefficients except the dimension $d$. Since $\|x\|_2\ll\|x\|_1\leq\sqrt{d}\|x\|_2$ for problems with extremely large $d$, our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^T E\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{T^{1/4}})$ rate of SGD in the ideal case of $\|\nabla f(x)\|_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d}\|\nabla f(x)\|_2)$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyuan Xu, Liyao Xiang, Borui Yang, Xingjun Ma, Siheng Chen, Baochun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking is a critical tool for model ownership verification. However, existing watermarking techniques are often designed for specific data modalities and downstream tasks, without considering the inherent architectural properties of the model. This lack of generality and robustness underscores the need for a more versatile watermarking approach. In this work, we investigate the properties of Transformer models and propose TokenMark, a modality-agnostic, robust watermarking system for pre-trained models, leveraging the permutation equivariance property. TokenMark embeds the watermark by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a set of specifically permuted data samples, resulting in a watermarked model that contains two distinct sets of weights -- one for normal functionality and the other for watermark extraction, the latter triggered only by permuted inputs. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art pre-trained models demonstrate that TokenMark significantly improves the robustness, efficiency, and universality of model watermarking, highlighting its potential as a unified watermarking solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsuyuki Miyai, Jingkang Yang, Jingyang Zhang, Yifei Ming, Qing Yu, Go Irie, Yixuan Li, Hai Li, Ziwei Liu, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emi Soroka, Rohan Sinha, Sanjay Lall</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild statistical assumptions. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Nian, Zhiyuan Peng, Qifan Wang, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers, relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxia Wu, Lizi Liao, Yuan Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling dynamic graphs, such as those found in social networks, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms, is crucial for capturing evolving relationships and delivering relevant insights over time. Traditional approaches primarily rely on graph neural networks with temporal components or sequence generation models, which often focus narrowly on the historical context of target nodes. This limitation restricts the ability to adapt to new and emerging patterns in dynamic graphs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph modeling (RAG4DyG), which enhances dynamic graph predictions by incorporating contextually and temporally relevant examples from broader graph structures. Our approach includes a time- and context-aware contrastive learning module to identify high-quality demonstrations and a graph fusion strategy to effectively integrate these examples with historical contexts. The proposed framework is designed to be effective in both transductive and inductive scenarios, ensuring adaptability to previously unseen nodes and evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAG4DyG in improving predictive accuracy and adaptability for dynamic graph modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Hanneke, Samory Kpotufe</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer Learning aims to optimally aggregate samples from a target distribution, with related samples from a so-called source distribution to improve target risk. Multiple procedures have been proposed over the last two decades to address this problem, each driven by one of a multitude of possible divergence measures between source and target distributions. A first question asked in this work is whether there exist unified algorithmic approaches that automatically adapt to many of these divergence measures simultaneously.
  We show that this is indeed the case for a large family of divergences proposed across classification and regression tasks, as they all happen to upper-bound the same measure of continuity between source and target risks, which we refer to as a weak modulus of transfer. This more unified view allows us, first, to identify algorithmic approaches that are simultaneously adaptive to these various divergence measures via a reduction to particular confidence sets. Second, it allows for a more refined understanding of the statistical limits of transfer under such divergences, and in particular, reveals regimes with faster rates than might be expected under coarser lenses.
  We then turn to situations that are not well captured by the weak modulus and corresponding divergences: these are situations where the aggregate of source and target data can improve target performance significantly beyond what's possible with either source or target data alone. We show that common such situations -- as may arise, e.g., under certain causal models with spurious correlations -- are well described by a so-called strong modulus of transfer which supersedes the weak modulus. We finally show that the strong modulus also admits adaptive procedures, which achieve near optimal rates in terms of the unknown strong modulus, and therefore apply in more general settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashu Zhang (Yiming), Zihan Pan (Yiming),  Molly (Yiming),  Xu, Khuzaima Daudjee, Sihang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The occurrence of bubbles in pipeline parallelism is an inherent limitation that can account for more than 40% of the large language model (LLM) training time and is one of the main reasons for the underutilization of GPU resources in LLM training. Harvesting these bubbles for GPU side tasks can increase resource utilization and reduce training costs but comes with challenges. First, because bubbles are discontinuous with various shapes, programming side tasks becomes difficult while requiring excessive engineering effort. Second, a side task can compete with pipeline training for GPU resources and incur significant overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FreeRide, a system designed to harvest bubbles in pipeline parallelism for side tasks. FreeRide provides programmers with interfaces to implement side tasks easily, manages bubbles and side tasks during pipeline training, and controls access to GPU resources by side tasks to reduce overhead. We demonstrate that FreeRide achieves 7.8% average cost savings with a negligible overhead of about 1% in training LLMs while serving model training, graph analytics, and image processing side tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianou Ma, Weirui Peng, Chenyang Yang, Hua Shen, Kenneth Koedinger, Tongshuang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting LLMs for complex tasks (e.g., building a trip advisor chatbot) needs humans to clearly articulate customized requirements (e.g., "start the response with a tl;dr"). However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and "think step-by-step"). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Porta, Emanuele Dalsasso, Diego Marcos, Devis Tuia</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototypical part learning is emerging as a promising approach for making semantic segmentation interpretable. The model selects real patches seen during training as prototypes and constructs the dense prediction map based on the similarity between parts of the test image and the prototypes. This improves interpretability since the user can inspect the link between the predicted output and the patterns learned by the model in terms of prototypical information. In this paper, we propose a method for interpretable semantic segmentation that leverages multi-scale image representation for prototypical part learning. First, we introduce a prototype layer that explicitly learns diverse prototypical parts at several scales, leading to multi-scale representations in the prototype activation output. Then, we propose a sparse grouping mechanism that produces multi-scale sparse groups of these scale-specific prototypical parts. This provides a deeper understanding of the interactions between multi-scale object representations while enhancing the interpretability of the segmentation model. The experiments conducted on Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K demonstrate that the proposed method increases model sparsity, improves interpretability over existing prototype-based methods, and narrows the performance gap with the non-interpretable counterpart models. Code is available at github.com/eceo-epfl/ScaleProtoSeg.</p>

<p>Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Xiaoyu Tan, Yaochu Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods have been used to optimize long-term user engagement in recommendation systems. However, existing reinforcement learning-based recommendation systems do not fully exploit the relevance of individual user behavior across different platforms. One potential solution is to aggregate data from various platforms in a centralized location and use the aggregated data for training. However, this approach raises economic and legal concerns, including increased communication costs and potential threats to user privacy. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FedSlate}, a federated reinforcement learning recommendation algorithm that effectively utilizes information that is prohibited from being shared at a legal level. We employ the SlateQ algorithm to assist FedSlate in learning users' long-term behavior and evaluating the value of recommended content. We extend the existing application scope of recommendation systems from single-user single-platform to single-user multi-platform and address cross-platform learning challenges by introducing federated learning. We use RecSim to construct a simulation environment for evaluating FedSlate and compare its performance with state-of-the-art benchmark recommendation models. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effects of FedSlate over baseline methods in various environmental settings, and FedSlate facilitates the learning of recommendation strategies in scenarios where baseline methods are completely inapplicable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashuo Li, Shaokun Wang, Bo Qian, Yuhang He, Xing Wei, Qiang Wang, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiben Liu, Qiang Wang, Huijie Fan, Weihong Ren, Baojie Fan, Yandong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) exhibits a contradictory relationship between intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps when learning from continuous data. Intra-domain discrimination focuses on individual nuances (i.e., clothing type, accessories, etc.), while inter-domain gaps emphasize domain consistency. Achieving a trade-off between maximizing intra-domain discrimination and minimizing inter-domain gaps is a crucial challenge for improving LReID performance. Most existing methods strive to reduce inter-domain gaps through knowledge distillation to maintain domain consistency. However, they often ignore intra-domain discrimination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain consistency representation learning (DCR) model that explores global and attribute-wise representations as a bridge to balance intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps. At the intra-domain level, we explore the complementary relationship between global and attribute-wise representations to improve discrimination among similar identities. Excessive learning intra-domain discrimination can lead to catastrophic forgetting. We further develop an attribute-oriented anti-forgetting (AF) strategy that explores attribute-wise representations to enhance inter-domain consistency, and propose a knowledge consolidation (KC) strategy to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DCR model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LReID methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DCR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Veerapaneni, Muhammad Suhail Saleem, Jiaoyang Li, Maxim Likhachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods try to compute entire start-goal paths which are collision free. However, computing an entire path can take too long for MAPF systems where agents need to replan fast. Methods that address this typically employ a "windowed" approach and only try to find collision free paths for a small windowed timestep horizon. This adaptation comes at the cost of incompleteness; all current windowed approaches can become stuck in deadlock or livelock. Our main contribution is to introduce our framework, WinC-MAPF, for Windowed MAPF that enables completeness. Our framework uses heuristic update insights from single-agent real-time heuristic search algorithms as well as agent independence ideas from MAPF algorithms. We also develop Single-Step CBS (SS-CBS), an instantiation of this framework using a novel modification to CBS. We show how SS-CBS, which only plans a single step and updates heuristics, can effectively solve tough scenarios where existing windowed approaches fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Mrkos, Anton\'in Komenda, David Fiedler, Ji\v{r}\'i Vok\v{r}\'inek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model for online dynamic pricing of electric vehicle charging services that integrates reservation, parking, and charging into a comprehensive bundle priced as a whole. Our approach focuses on the individual high-demand, fast-charging location, employing a Poisson process as a model of charging reservation arrivals, and develops an online dynamic pricing strategy optimized through a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A key contribution is the novel analysis of discretization error introduced when incorporating the continuous-time Poisson process into the discrete MDP framework. The MDP model's feasibility is demonstrated with a heuristic dynamic pricing method based on Monte-Carlo tree search, offering a viable path for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Guo, Lianghao Xia, Yanhua Yu, Tu Ao, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAG systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval system that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuheng Wang, Yukai Shi, Jiarong Ou, Rui Chen, Ke Lin, Jiahao Wang, Boyuan Jiang, Haotian Yang, Mingwu Zheng, Xin Tao, Fei Yang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous progress of visual generation technologies, the scale of video datasets has grown exponentially. The quality of these datasets plays a pivotal role in the performance of video generation models. We assert that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three crucial determinants of dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The essence of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset. Our dataset and code have been released at https://koala36m.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Razin, Sadhika Malladi, Adithya Bhaskar, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora, Boris Hanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Xu, Rujun Han, Zifeng Wang, Long T. Le, Dhruv Madeka, Lei Li, William Yang Wang, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) have enabled smaller student models to approach the performance of larger teacher models. However, popular methods such as supervised KD and on-policy KD, are adversely impacted by the knowledge gaps between teacher-student in practical scenarios. Supervised KD suffers from a distribution mismatch between training with a static dataset and inference over final student-generated outputs. Conversely, on-policy KD, which uses student-generated samples for training, can suffer from low-quality training examples with which teacher models are not familiar, resulting in inaccurate teacher feedback. To address these limitations, we introduce Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a novel approach that leverages cooperation between student and teacher models to generate high-quality training data on-the-fly while aligning with the student's inference-time distribution. In SKD, the student proposes tokens, and the teacher replaces poorly ranked ones based on its own distribution, transferring high-quality knowledge adaptively. We evaluate SKD on various text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, math, and instruction following, and show that SKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods across different domains, data sizes, and model initialization strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open domain question answering systems frequently rely on information retrieved from large collections of text (such as the Web) to answer questions. However, such collections of text often contain conflicting information, and indiscriminately depending on this information may result in untruthful and inaccurate answers. To understand the gravity of this problem, we collect a human-annotated dataset, Question Answering with Conflicting Contexts (QACC), and find that as much as 25% of unambiguous, open domain questions can lead to conflicting contexts when retrieved using Google Search. We evaluate and benchmark three powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with our dataset QACC and demonstrate their limitations in effectively addressing questions with conflicting information. To explore how humans reason through conflicting contexts, we request our annotators to provide explanations for their selections of correct answers. We demonstrate that by finetuning LLMs to explain their answers, we can introduce richer information into their training that guide them through the process of reasoning with conflicting contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Noukhovitch, Shengyi Huang, Sophie Xhonneux, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Gao, Jianhui Wang, Xinyuan Song, Yangfan He, Fangxu Xing, Tianyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wei, Zheyang Xiong, Weiming Ren, Xinrun Du, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing methods have demonstrated significant potential by training diffusion models on automatically synthesized or manually annotated image editing pairs. However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that \omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Yida Xu, Yunya Song, Xian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack of domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable mutlimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in a same encoding space, enabling it naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Lv, Yangqi Long, Congzhentao Huang, Cao Li, Chengfei Lv, Hao Ren, Dian Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo video synthesis from a monocular input is a demanding task in the fields of spatial computing and virtual reality. The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively. We evaluated the proposed method against various benchmark methods, with the results showcasing its superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Song, Yicheng Wu, Minhao Hu, Xiangde Luo, Linda Wei, Guotai Wang, Yi Guo, Feng Xu, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal MR image synthesis aims to generate missing modality images by effectively fusing and mapping from a subset of available MRI modalities. Most existing methods adopt an image-to-image translation paradigm, treating multiple modalities as input channels. However, these approaches often yield sub-optimal results due to the inherent difficulty in achieving precise feature- or semantic-level alignment across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network (AGI-Net) that explicitly models both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships for multimodal MR image synthesis. Specifically, feature channels are first partitioned into predefined groups, after which an adaptive rolling mechanism is applied to conventional convolutional kernels to better capture feature and semantic correspondences between different modalities. In parallel, a cross-group attention module is introduced to enable effective feature fusion across groups, thereby enhancing the network's representational capacity. We validate the proposed AGI-Net on the publicly available IXI and BraTS2023 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that AGI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal MR image synthesis tasks, confirming the effectiveness of its modality-aware interaction design. We release the relevant code at: https://github.com/zunzhumu/Adaptive-Group-wise-Interaction-Network-for-Multimodal-MRI-Synthesis.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Tan, Hao Luan, Mingyu Luo, Xiaoyan Sun, Ping Chen, Jun Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) aims to leverage the sequential patterns in users' historical interactions to accurately track their preferences. However, the primary reliance of existing SR methods on collaborative data results in challenges such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Concurrently, despite the proven effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), their integration into commercial recommender systems is impeded by issues such as high inference latency, incomplete capture of all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) framework to enhance SR models with LLMs. In particular, we initially pre-train both the SR and LLM models to obtain collaborative and textual embeddings. Subsequently, we propose a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Lastly, a triple-experts architecture, comprising aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experimental results on three public datasets validate the efficacy of PAD, indicating substantial enhancements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, particularly for cold items.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Arabi, Benjamin Feuer, R. Teal Witter, Chinmay Hegde, Niv Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cooperation is vital to our survival and progress. Evolutionary game theory offers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable cooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents become integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on unprecedented significance. The convergence of human-agent teaming, contract theory, and decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency, accountability, and trust, offers a foundation for fostering cooperation by establishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. We conceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as a social contract between humans and AI, inspired by Web3 principles and encoded in blockchain technology, to define and enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both parties. By exploring this paradigm, we aim to catalyze new research at the intersection of systems thinking in AI, Web3, and society, fostering innovative pathways for cooperative human-agent coevolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Song, Yicheng Wu, Minhao Hu, Xiangde Luo, Guoting Luo, Guotai Wang, Yi Guo, Feng Xu, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction plays a vital role in reducing scan time while preserving image quality. While most existing methods rely on complex-valued image-space or k-space data, these formats are often inaccessible in clinical practice due to proprietary reconstruction pipelines, leaving only magnitude images stored in DICOM files. To address this gap, we focus on the underexplored task of magnitude-image-based MRI reconstruction. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling image priors. However, their task-agnostic denoising nature limits performance in source-to-target image translation tasks, such as MRI reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge (SC-NDB) framework that models accelerated MRI reconstruction as a bi-directional image translation process between under-sampled and fully-sampled magnitude MRI images. SC-NDB introduces a nested diffusion architecture with a self-consistency constraint and reverse bridge diffusion pathways to improve intermediate prediction fidelity and better capture the explicit priors of source images. Furthermore, we incorporate a Contour Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) to inject structural and textural knowledge by leveraging Laplacian pyramids and directional filter banks. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both magnitude-based and non-magnitude-based diffusion models, confirming the effectiveness and clinical relevance of SC-NDB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyan Zhang, Renchi Yang, Yurui Lai, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.

<p><b>Authors:</b> ChonLam Lao, Minlan Yu, Aditya Akella, Jiamin Cao, Yu Guan, Pengcheng Zhang, Zhilong Zheng, Yichi Xu, Ennan Zhai, Dennis Cai, Jiaqi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale ML training jobs are frequently interrupted by hardware and software anomalies, failures, and management events. Existing solutions like checkpointing or runtime reconfiguration suffer from long downtimes, degraded performance, or undesired changes to training strategies. We present TrainMover, a resilient runtime that leverages standby machines to handle interruptions with minimal downtime and zero memory overhead. To achieve these goals, TrainMover introduces two key techniques: two-phase, delta-based communication group setups and communication-free sandboxed shadow iterations. Our evaluation shows that TrainMover consistently achieves second-level downtime across all evaluated models during migration, maintaining 99\% training efficiency during periodic 10-minute rebalancing. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of TrainMover in handling various interruptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Ruan, Xuan Wang, Jixiang Hong, Peng Wang, Yang Liu, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in scientific tasks such as literature analysis and experimental design (e.g., accurately extracting key findings from papers or generating coherent experimental procedures), existing evaluation benchmarks primarily assess performance using rich contextual inputs. We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs' scientific idea generation by assessing divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our benchmark employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across five key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, flexibility, and clarity. Through extensive experimentation with over 40 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 22 scientific domains, we reveal that the scientific idea generation capabilities measured by our benchmark, are poorly predicted by standard metrics of general intelligence. Our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve creative performance comparable to top-tier models such as claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores. These findings highlight the need for specialized evaluation benchmarks for scientific idea generation and suggest that enhancing these idea generation capabilities in LLMs may require different training strategies than those used for improving general problem-solving abilities, potentially enabling a wider range of AI tools tailored for different stages of the scientific process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Abdellatif, Ahmed Ayman, Ali Hamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating high-volume unstructured data processing is essential for operational efficiency. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical but often struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex layouts and ambiguous text. These challenges are especially pronounced in large-scale tasks requiring both speed and precision. This paper introduces LMV-RPA, a Large Model Voting-based Robotic Process Automation system to enhance OCR workflows. LMV-RPA integrates outputs from OCR engines such as Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR, Easy OCR, and DocTR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 3 and Gemini-1.5-pro. Using a majority voting mechanism, it processes OCR outputs into structured JSON formats, improving accuracy, particularly in complex layouts. The multi-phase pipeline processes text extracted by OCR engines through LLMs, combining results to ensure the most accurate outputs. LMV-RPA achieves 99 percent accuracy in OCR tasks, surpassing baseline models with 94 percent, while reducing processing time by 80 percent. Benchmark evaluations confirm its scalability and demonstrate that LMV-RPA offers a faster, more reliable, and efficient solution for automating large-scale document processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Abdulsalam, Usman Zahidi, Bradley Hurst, Simon Pearson, Grzegorz Cielniak, James Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: Tomato anomalies/damages pose a significant challenge in greenhouse farming. While this method of cultivation benefits from efficient resource utilization, anomalies can significantly degrade the quality of farm produce. A common anomaly associated with tomatoes is splitting, characterized by the development of cracks on the tomato skin, which degrades its quality. Detecting this type of anomaly is challenging due to dynamic variations in appearance and sizes, compounded by dataset scarcity. We address this problem in an unsupervised manner by utilizing a tailored variational autoencoder (VAE) with hyperspectral input. Preliminary analysis of the dataset enabled us to select the optimal range of wavelengths for detecting this anomaly. Our findings indicate that the 530nm - 550nm range is suitable for identifying tomato dry splits. The proposed VAE model achieved a 97% detection accuracy for tomato split anomalies in the test data. The analysis on reconstruction loss allow us to not only detect the anomalies but also to some degree estimate the anomalous regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindita Chattopadhyay, Siddharth Bisariya, Vijay Kumar Sutrakar</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit design, detecting Hardware Trojans (HTs) within a multi entity based design cycle presents significant challenges. This research proposes an innovative machine learning-based methodology for identifying malicious logic gates in gate-level netlists. By focusing on path retrace algorithms. The methodology is validated across three distinct cases, each employing different machine learning models to classify HTs. Case I utilizes a decision tree algorithm for node-to-node comparisons, significantly improving detection accuracy through the integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Case II introduces a graph-to-graph classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, enabling the differentiation between normal and Trojan-infected circuit designs. Case III applies GNN-based node classification to identify individual compromised nodes and its location. Additionally, nearest neighbor (NN) method has been combined with GNN graph-to-graph in Case II and GNN node-to-node in Case III. Despite the potential of GNN model graph-to-graph classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the first nearest neighbor (1st NN) achieving 73.2% accuracy and the second nearest neighbor (2nd NN) method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 62.8%. Similarly, GNN model node-to-node classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the 1st NN achieving 93% accuracy and the 2nd NN method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 79.8%. However, higher and higher NN will lead to large code coverage for the identification of HTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Irabor, Mariam Musavi, Abhijit Das, Sergi Abadal</p>
<p>Abstract: The insatiable appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads for computing power is pushing the industry to develop faster and more efficient accelerators. The rigidity of custom hardware, however, conflicts with the need for scalable and versatile architectures capable of catering to the needs of the evolving and heterogeneous pool of Machine Learning (ML) models in the literature. In this context, multi-chiplet architectures assembling multiple (perhaps heterogeneous) accelerators are an appealing option that is unfortunately hindered by the still rigid and inefficient chip-to-chip interconnects. In this paper, we explore the potential of wireless technology as a complement to existing wired interconnects in this multi-chiplet approach. Using an evaluation framework from the state-of-the-art, we show that wireless interconnects can lead to speedups of 10% on average and 20% maximum. We also highlight the importance of load balancing between the wired and wireless interconnects, which will be further explored in future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Tejwani, Karl Velazquez, John Payne, Paolo Bonato, Harry Asada</p>
<p>Abstract: A method for cross-modality embedding of force profile and words is presented for synergistic coordination of verbal and haptic communication. When two people carry a large, heavy object together, they coordinate through verbal communication about the intended movements and physical forces applied to the object. This natural integration of verbal and physical cues enables effective coordination. Similarly, human-robot interaction could achieve this level of coordination by integrating verbal and haptic communication modalities. This paper presents a framework for embedding words and force profiles in a unified manner, so that the two communication modalities can be integrated and coordinated in a way that is effective and synergistic. Here, it will be shown that, although language and physical force profiles are deemed completely different, the two can be embedded in a unified latent space and proximity between the two can be quantified. In this latent space, a force profile and words can a) supplement each other, b) integrate the individual effects, and c) substitute in an exchangeable manner. First, the need for cross-modality embedding is addressed, and the basic architecture and key building block technologies are presented. Methods for data collection and implementation challenges will be addressed, followed by experimental results and discussions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Lipardi, Domenica Dibenedetto, Georgios Stamoulis, Mark H. M. Winands</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits exhibit up to three times fewer CNOT gates, which is important for implementation on noisy quantum hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yankai Fu, Qiuxuan Feng, Ning Chen, Zichen Zhou, Mengzhen Liu, Mingdong Wu, Tianxing Chen, Shanyu Rong, Jiaming Liu, Hao Dong, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayi Wang, Zirui Wang, Junli Ren, Qingwei Ben, Tao Huang, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traversing risky terrains with sparse footholds poses a significant challenge for humanoid robots, requiring precise foot placements and stable locomotion. Existing learning-based approaches often struggle on such complex terrains due to sparse foothold rewards and inefficient learning processes. To address these challenges, we introduce BeamDojo, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for enabling agile humanoid locomotion on sparse footholds. BeamDojo begins by introducing a sampling-based foothold reward tailored for polygonal feet, along with a double critic to balancing the learning process between dense locomotion rewards and sparse foothold rewards. To encourage sufficient trial-and-error exploration, BeamDojo incorporates a two-stage RL approach: the first stage relaxes the terrain dynamics by training the humanoid on flat terrain while providing it with task-terrain perceptive observations, and the second stage fine-tunes the policy on the actual task terrain. Moreover, we implement a onboard LiDAR-based elevation map to enable real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that BeamDojo achieves efficient learning in simulation and enables agile locomotion with precise foot placement on sparse footholds in the real world, maintaining a high success rate even under significant external disturbances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalizable humanoid loco-manipulation poses significant challenges, requiring coordinated whole-body control and precise, contact-rich object manipulation. To address this, this paper introduces HOMIE, a semi-autonomous teleoperation system that combines a reinforcement learning policy for body control mapped to a pedal, an isomorphic exoskeleton arm for arm control, and motion-sensing gloves for hand control, forming a unified cockpit to freely operate humanoids and establish a data flywheel. The policy incorporates novel designs, including an upper-body pose curriculum, a height-tracking reward, and symmetry utilization. These features enable the system to perform walking and squatting to specific heights while seamlessly adapting to arbitrary upper-body poses. The exoskeleton, by eliminating the reliance on inverse dynamics, delivers faster and more precise arm control. The gloves utilize Hall sensors instead of servos, allowing even compact devices to achieve 15 or more degrees of freedom and freely adapt to any model of dexterous hands. Compared to previous teleoperation systems, HOMIE stands out for its exceptional efficiency, completing tasks in half the time; its expanded working range, allowing users to freely reach high and low areas as well as interact with any objects; and its affordability, with a price of just $500. The system is fully open-source, demos and code can be found in our https://homietele.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational Product Search ( CPS ) systems interact with users via natural language to offer personalized and context-aware product lists. However, most existing research on CPS is limited to simulated conversations, due to the lack of a real CPS dataset driven by human-like language. Moreover, existing conversational datasets for e-commerce are constructed for a particular market or a particular language and thus can not support cross-market and multi-lingual usage. In this paper, we propose a CPS data collection protocol and create a new CPS dataset, called PSCon, which assists product search through conversations with human-like language. The dataset is collected by a coached human-human data collection protocol and is available for dual markets and two languages. By formulating the task of CPS, the dataset allows for comprehensive and in-depth research on six subtasks: user intent detection, keyword extraction, system action prediction, question selection, item ranking, and response generation. Moreover, we present a concise analysis of the dataset and propose a benchmark model on the proposed CPS dataset. Our proposed dataset and model will be helpful for facilitating future research on CPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and performance metrics, demonstrating a 10% improvement in user satisfaction and a 5\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Home-based single-lead AI-ECG devices have enabled continuous, real-world cardiac monitoring. However, the accuracy of parameter calculations from single-lead AI-ECG algorithm remains to be fully validated, which is critical for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block (AVBI). In this multicenter study, we assessed FeatureDB, an ECG measurements computation algorithm, in the context of single-lead monitoring using three annotated datasets: PTB-XL+ (n=21,354), CSE (n=105), and HeartVoice-ECG-lite (n=369). FeatureDB showed strong correlation with standard ECG machines (12SL and Uni-G) in key measurements (PR, QRS, QT, QTc), and high agreement confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. In detecting LQTS (AUC=0.786) and AVBI (AUC=0.684), FeatureDB demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to commercial ECG systems (12SL: 0.859/0.716; Uni-G: 0.817/0.605), significantly outperforming ECGDeli (0.501/0.569). Notably, FeatureDB can operate locally on resource-limited devices, facilitating use in low-connectivity settings. These findings confirm the clinical reliability of FeatureDB for single-lead ECG diagnostics and highlight its potential to bridge traditional ECG diagnostics with wearable technology for scalable cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moo Jin Kim, Chelsea Finn, Percy Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language-action models (VLAs) build upon pretrained vision-language models and leverage diverse robot datasets to demonstrate strong task execution, language following ability, and semantic generalization. Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate. We release code for OFT and pretrained model checkpoints at https://openvla-oft.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan L. Gamella, Simon Bing, Jakob Runge</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate methods for causal representation learning (CRL) on a simple, real-world system where these methods are expected to work. The system consists of a controlled optical experiment specifically built for this purpose, which satisfies the core assumptions of CRL and where the underlying causal factors (the inputs to the experiment) are known, providing a ground truth. We select methods representative of different approaches to CRL and find that they all fail to recover the underlying causal factors. To understand the failure modes of the evaluated algorithms, we perform an ablation on the data by substituting the real data-generating process with a simpler synthetic equivalent. The results reveal a reproducibility problem, as most methods already fail on this synthetic ablation despite its simple data-generating process. Additionally, we observe that common assumptions on the mixing function are crucial for the performance of some of the methods but do not hold in the real data. Our efforts highlight the contrast between the theoretical promise of the state of the art and the challenges in its application. We hope the benchmark serves as a simple, real-world sanity check to further develop and validate methodology, bridging the gap towards CRL methods that work in practice. We make all code and datasets publicly available at github.com/simonbing/CRLSanityCheck</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenrui Cheng, Tiantian Zhu, Chunlin Xiong, Haofei Sun, Zijun Wang, Shunan Jing, Mingqi Lv, Yan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes) have been widely proposed for endpoint threat analysis. However, due to the lack of systematic integration and utilization of knowledge, existing PIDSes still require significant manual intervention for practical deployment, making full automation challenging. This paper presents a disruptive innovation by categorizing PIDSes according to the types of knowledge they utilize. In response to the prevalent issue of ``knowledge silos problem'' in existing research, we introduce a novel knowledge-driven provenance-based intrusion detection framework, powered by large language models (LLMs). We also present OmniSec, a best practice system built upon this framework. By integrating attack representation knowledge, threat intelligence knowledge, and benign behavior knowledge, OmniSec outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on public benchmark datasets. OmniSec is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIDS-with-LLM-613B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liying Han, Gaofeng Dong, Xiaomin Ouyang, Lance Kaplan, Federico Cerutti, Mani Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofei Kong, Lei Li, Zhaoyun Chen, Cheng Xue, Xiaofan Xu, Huanyu Liu, Yuchun Wu, Yuan Fang, Han Fang, Kejiang Chen, Yang Yang, Menghan Dou, Guoping Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models through low-rank matrix approximation, achieving effectiveness in many scenarios. However, its representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. To overcome the expressive bottleneck in classical low-rank approximation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we propose Quantum Tensor Hybrid Adaptation (QTHA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with a tensor network. QTHA explores quantum tensor hybrid fine-tuning within low-rank spaces by decomposing pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, leveraging quantum state superposition to overcome classical rank limitations. Experiments demonstrate that QTHA achieves performance comparable to or surpassing LoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, QTHA reduces trainable parameters by 76% while reducing training loss by up to 17% and improving test set performance by up to 17% within the same training steps. This research not only enables lightweight adaptation of quantum resources to the billion-parameter models but also validates the feasibility of quantum hardware optimization driven by LLM tasks. It establishes the first engineering-ready foundation for future quantum-enhanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Xue, Longfei Wei, Fang Sheng, Jianfei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkwan Lee, Kyomin Hwang, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG), where the distributions of train and test data differ, and only a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data are available during training. Existing SSDG methods that leverage only the unlabeled samples for which the model's predictions are highly confident (confident-unlabeled samples), limit the full utilization of the available unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore a method for incorporating the unconfident-unlabeled samples that were previously disregarded in SSDG setting. To this end, we propose UPCSC to utilize these unconfident-unlabeled samples in SSDG that consists of two modules: 1) Unlabeled Proxy-based Contrastive learning (UPC) module, treating unconfident-unlabeled samples as additional negative pairs and 2) Surrogate Class learning (SC) module, generating positive pairs for unconfident-unlabeled samples using their confusing class set. These modules are plug-and-play and do not require any domain labels, which can be easily integrated into existing approaches. Experiments on four widely used SSDG benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance when attached to baselines and outperforms competing plug-and-play methods. We also analyze the role of our method in SSDG, showing that it enhances class-level discriminability and mitigates domain gaps. The code is available at https://github.com/dongkwani/UPCSC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ketan Suhaas Saichandran, Xavier Thomas, Prakhar Kaushik, Deepti Ghadiyaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models often struggle with long prompts detailing complex scenes, diverse objects with distinct visual characteristics and spatial relationships. In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lahiru Akmeemana, Chamodya Attanayake, Husni Faiz, Sandareka Wickramanayake</p>
<p>Abstract: The transition to microservices has revolutionized software architectures, offering enhanced scalability and modularity. However, the distributed and dynamic nature of microservices introduces complexities in ensuring system reliability, making anomaly detection crucial for maintaining performance and functionality. Anomalies stemming from network and performance issues must be swiftly identified and addressed. Existing anomaly detection techniques often rely on statistical models or machine learning methods that struggle with the high-dimensional, interdependent data inherent in microservice applications. Current techniques and available datasets predominantly focus on system traces and logs, limiting their ability to support advanced detection models. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing the RS-Anomic dataset generated using the open-source RobotShop microservice application. The dataset captures multivariate performance metrics and response times under normal and anomalous conditions, encompassing ten types of anomalies. We propose a novel anomaly detection model called Graph Attention and LSTM-based Microservice Anomaly Detection (GAL-MAD), leveraging Graph Attention and Long Short-Term Memory architectures to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in microservices. We utilize SHAP values to localize anomalous services and identify root causes to enhance explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that GAL-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on the RS-Anomic dataset, achieving higher accuracy and recall across varying anomaly rates. The explanations provide actionable insights into service anomalies, which benefits system administrators.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the challenge of insufficient interactivity and behavioral diversity in autonomous driving decision-making, this paper proposes a Cognitive Hierarchical Agent for Reasoning and Motion Stylization (CHARMS). By leveraging Level-k game theory, CHARMS captures human-like reasoning patterns through a two-stage training pipeline comprising reinforcement learning pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This enables the resulting models to exhibit diverse and human-like behaviors, enhancing their decision-making capacity and interaction fidelity in complex traffic environments. Building upon this capability, we further develop a scenario generation framework that utilizes the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory to control the distribution of vehicles with different driving styles through Poisson and binomial sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS is capable of both making intelligent driving decisions as an ego vehicle and generating diverse, realistic driving scenarios as environment vehicles. The code for CHARMS is released at https://github.com/chuduanfeng/CHARMS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction plays a pivotal role in deciphering cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address the limitations of traditional experimental methods and existing computational approaches in cross-modal feature fusion and false-negative suppression, we propose SCMPPI-a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework. By effectively integrating sequence-based features (AAC, DPC, ESMC-CKSAAP) with network topology (Node2Vec embeddings) and incorporating an enhanced contrastive learning strategy with negative sample filtering, SCMPPI achieves superior prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy(98.13%) and AUC(99.69%), along with excellent cross-species generalization (AUC>99%). Successful applications in CD9 networks, Wnt pathway analysis, and cancer-specific networks further highlight its potential for disease target discovery, establishing SCMPPI as a powerful tool for multimodal biological data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanwei Wang, Qunsong Zeng, Haotian Zheng, Kaibin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the key missions of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks is to deploy large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge to provide remote-inference services for edge devices. The resultant platform, known as edge inference, will support a wide range of Internet-of-Things applications, such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Given the mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential to design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which primarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage probability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of E2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the inference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the E2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency constraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between communication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference reliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to optimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut probability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the received discriminant gain. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over conventional communication-centric approaches in terms of E2E inference reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxia Dai, Wenqian Luo, Tianyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungwon Lim, Seungbeen Lee, Dongjun Min, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Kerdreux, Alexandre Tuel, Quentin Febvre, Alexis Mouche, Bertrand Chapron</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the development of vision foundation models for Earth Observation (EO), demonstrating strong transferability across diverse remote sensing tasks. While prior work has focused on network architectures and training strategies, the role of dataset curation, especially in balancing and diversifying pre-training datasets, remains underexplored. In EO, this challenge is amplified by the redundancy and heavy-tailed distributions common in satellite imagery, which can lead to biased representations and inefficient training.
  In this work, we propose a dynamic dataset pruning strategy designed to improve SSL pre-training by maximizing dataset diversity and balance. Our method iteratively refines the training set without requiring a pre-existing feature extractor, making it well-suited for domains where curated datasets are limited or unavailable. We demonstrate our approach on the Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) archive, a challenging dataset dominated by ocean observations. We train models from scratch on the entire Sentinel-1 WV archive spanning 10 years. Across three downstream tasks, our results show that dynamic pruning improves both computational efficiency and representation quality, leading to stronger transferability.
  We also release the weights of OceanSAR-1, the first model in the OceanSAR family, a series of foundation models for ocean observation and analysis using SAR imagery, at github.com/galeio-research/OceanSAR-models/.</p>

Through interviews and persona development, we prioritized accessibility and dual functionality: simplifying internal information retrieval and improving technology and eHealth literacy. A pilot trial with residents demonstrated high satisfaction and ease of use, but also identified areas for further improvement. Based on the feedback, we refined the chatbot using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Streamlit. The chatbot employs tailored prompt engineering to deliver concise responses. Accessible features like adjustable font size, interface theme and personalized follow-up responses were implemented. Future steps include enabling voice-to-text function and longitudinal intervention studies. Together, our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven chatbots to empower older adults through accessible, personalized interactions, bridging literacy gaps in retirement communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reliance on translated or adapted datasets from English or multilingual resources introduces challenges regarding linguistic and cultural suitability. This study addresses the need for robust and culturally appropriate benchmarks by evaluating the quality of 17 commonly used Turkish benchmark datasets. Using a comprehensive framework that assesses six criteria, both human and LLM-judge annotators provide detailed evaluations to identify dataset strengths and shortcomings.
  Our results reveal that 70% of the benchmark datasets fail to meet our heuristic quality standards. The correctness of the usage of technical terms is the strongest criterion, but 85% of the criteria are not satisfied in the examined datasets. Although LLM judges demonstrate potential, they are less effective than human annotators, particularly in understanding cultural common sense knowledge and interpreting fluent, unambiguous text. GPT-4o has stronger labeling capabilities for grammatical and technical tasks, while Llama3.3-70B excels at correctness and cultural knowledge evaluation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for more rigorous quality control in creating and adapting datasets for low-resource languages.</p>

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyao Ding, Bohan Hou, Xiao Zhang, Allan Lin, Tianqi Chen, Cody Yu Hao, Yida Wang, Gennady Pekhimenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aitor Gomez-Tejedor, Eneko Osaba, Esther Villar-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsin-Yi Lin, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</p>

<p>Abstract: The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I" of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations such as knowledge latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper, we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly updated collection of papers on test-time scaling in the GitHub Repository: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/cognition-engineering</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chameera De Silva, Thilina Halloluwa, Dhaval Vyas</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems is often constrained by concerns over transparency, interpretability, and trust. While Human-Centered AI (HCAI) emphasizes alignment with human values, Explainable AI (XAI) enhances transparency by making AI decisions more understandable. However, the lack of a unified approach limits AI's effectiveness in critical decision-making scenarios. This paper presents a novel three-layered framework that bridges HCAI and XAI to establish a structured explainability paradigm. The framework comprises (1) a foundational AI model with built-in explainability mechanisms, (2) a human-centered explanation layer that tailors explanations based on cognitive load and user expertise, and (3) a dynamic feedback loop that refines explanations through real-time user interaction. The framework is evaluated across healthcare, finance, and software development, demonstrating its potential to enhance decision-making, regulatory compliance, and public trust. Our findings advance Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI), fostering AI systems that are transparent, adaptable, and ethically aligned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Zhang, Jingxing Zhong, Guangzhen Yao, Renda Han, Xiaojian Lin, Zeyu Zhang, Cuicui Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Fraudulent activities have significantly increased across various domains, such as e-commerce, online review platforms, and social networks, making fraud detection a critical task. Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to fraud detection tasks due to their strong inductive learning capabilities. However, existing spatial GNN-based methods often enhance the graph structure by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing to align with the homophilic bias of GNNs. Unfortunately, this approach can disrupt the original graph topology and increase uncertainty in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection. DHMP leverages a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating the low-pass inductive bias of traditional GNNs. It then applies shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and incorporates a customized sampling strategy for training. This allows nodes to adaptively balance the contributions of various signals based on their labels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DHMP outperforms existing methods, highlighting the importance of separating signals with different frequencies for improved fraud detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abdul Baset Sarker, Art Nguyen, Sigmond Kukla, Kevin Fite, Masudul H. Imtiaz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel AI vision-enabled pediatric prosthetic hand designed to assist children aged 10-12 with upper limb disabilities. The prosthesis features an anthropomorphic appearance, multi-articulating functionality, and a lightweight design that mimics a natural hand, making it both accessible and affordable for low-income families. Using 3D printing technology and integrating advanced machine vision, sensing, and embedded computing, the prosthetic hand offers a low-cost, customizable solution that addresses the limitations of current myoelectric prostheses. A micro camera is interfaced with a low-power FPGA for real-time object detection and assists with precise grasping. The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp classification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the force prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features of the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted micro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks; b) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and c) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained power and resource limits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magnus Petersen, Roberto Covino</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Yang, Weichen Bi, Haiyang Shen, Yaoqi Guo, Yun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) datasets are crucial for various downstream tasks. However, GUI datasets often generate annotation information through automatic labeling, which commonly results in inaccurate GUI element BBox annotations, including missing, duplicate, or meaningless BBoxes. These issues can degrade the performance of models trained on these datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally, existing GUI datasets only provide BBox annotations visually, which restricts the development of visually related GUI downstream tasks. To address these issues, we introduce PixelWeb, a large-scale GUI dataset containing over 100,000 annotated web pages. PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that integrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure analysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis. Channel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of occlusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap annotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and stacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally, PixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and mask annotations. Manual verification by three independent annotators confirms the high quality and accuracy of PixelWeb annotations. Experimental results on GUI element detection tasks show that PixelWeb achieves performance on the mAP95 metric that is 3-7 times better than existing datasets. We believe that PixelWeb has great potential for performance improvement in downstream tasks such as GUI generation and automated user interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have become vital across industries, yet current evaluation methods have not adapted to their widespread use. Traditional evaluations often rely on benchmarks and fixed datasets, frequently failing to reflect real-world performance, which creates a gap between lab-tested outcomes and practical applications. This white paper proposes a comprehensive framework for how we should evaluate real-world GenAI systems, emphasizing diverse, evolving inputs and holistic, dynamic, and ongoing assessment approaches. The paper offers guidance for practitioners on how to design evaluation methods that accurately reflect real-time capabilities, and provides policymakers with recommendations for crafting GenAI policies focused on societal impacts, rather than fixed performance numbers or parameter sizes. We advocate for holistic frameworks that integrate performance, fairness, and ethics and the use of continuous, outcome-oriented methods that combine human and automated assessments while also being transparent to foster trust among stakeholders. Implementing these strategies ensures GenAI models are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible and impactful.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate perception and neural responses as they improved on vision benchmarks, raising hopes that advances in AI would yield better models of biological vision. However, we show across three benchmarks that this alignment is now plateauing - and in some cases worsening - as DNNs scale to human or superhuman accuracy. This divergence may reflect the adoption of visual strategies that differ from those used by primates. These findings challenge the view that progress in artificial intelligence will naturally translate to neuroscience. We argue that vision science must chart its own course, developing algorithms grounded in biological visual systems rather than optimizing for benchmarks based on internet-scale datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasper Engelen, Guillermo A. P\'erez, Shrisha Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used as a fast pre-processing step in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwen Cao, Zhaoxing Zhang, Junming Jiao, Juyi Qiao, Guowen Song, Rong Shen, Xiangbing Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding remains a highly challenging task. Compared to texts or images, videos commonly contain more information with redundancy, requiring large models to properly allocate attention at a global level for comprehensive and accurate understanding. To address this, we propose a Multimodal hierarchical Attention focusing Self-reflective Reasoning (MASR) framework for agent-based video understanding. The key innovation lies in its ability to detect and prioritize segments of videos that are highly relevant to the query. Firstly, MASR realizes Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Relevance Sensing (MCRS) which enhances the correlation between the acquired contextual information and the query. Secondly, MASR employs Dilated Temporal Expansion (DTE) to mitigate the risk of missing crucial details when extracting semantic information from the focused frames selected through MCRS. By iteratively applying MCRS and DTE in the self-reflective reasoning process, MASR is able to adaptively adjust the attention to extract highly query-relevant context and therefore improve the response accuracy. In the EgoSchema dataset, MASR achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over previous leading approaches. In the Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms the state-of-the-art standards by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. In the Video-MME dataset that contains long-term videos, MASR also performs better than other agent-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Radia Berreziga, Mohammed Brahimi, Khairedine Kraim, Hamid Azzoune</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such, as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8\%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.</p>

However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce Hamlet, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed "IL+RL" training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingye Zhou, Caiyang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
