<p>Abstract: Efficient processing of long contexts has been a persistent pursuit in Natural Language Processing. With the growing number of long documents, dialogues, and other textual data, it is important to develop Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) that can process and analyze extensive inputs in an effective and efficient way. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on recent advances in long-context modeling for large language models. Our survey is structured around three key aspects: how to obtain effective and efficient LCLMs, how to train and deploy LCLMs efficiently, and how to evaluate and analyze LCLMs comprehensively. For the first aspect, we discuss data strategies, architectural designs, and workflow approaches oriented with long context processing. For the second aspect, we provide a detailed examination of the infrastructure required for LCLM training and inference. For the third aspect, we present evaluation paradigms for long-context comprehension and long-form generation, as well as behavioral analysis and mechanism interpretability of LCLMs. Beyond these three key aspects, we thoroughly explore the diverse application scenarios where existing LCLMs have been deployed and outline promising future development directions. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on long-context LLMs, which we wish to serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and engineers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veysel Kocaman, Yigit Gul, M. Aytug Kaya, Hasham Ul Haq, Mehmet Butgul, Cabir Celik, David Talby</p>
<p>Abstract: Assertion status detection is a critical yet often overlooked component of clinical NLP, essential for accurately attributing extracted medical facts. Past studies have narrowly focused on negation detection, leading to underperforming commercial solutions such as AWS Medical Comprehend, Azure AI Text Analytics, and GPT-4o due to their limited domain adaptation. To address this gap, we developed state-of-the-art assertion detection models, including fine-tuned LLMs, transformer-based classifiers, few-shot classifiers, and deep learning (DL) approaches. We evaluated these models against cloud-based commercial API solutions, the legacy rule-based NegEx approach, and GPT-4o. Our fine-tuned LLM achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.962), outperforming GPT-4o (0.901) and commercial APIs by a notable margin, particularly excelling in Present (+4.2%), Absent (+8.4%), and Hypothetical (+23.4%) assertions. Our DL-based models surpass commercial solutions in Conditional (+5.3%) and Associated-with-Someone-Else (+10.1%) categories, while the few-shot classifier offers a lightweight yet highly competitive alternative (0.929), making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. Integrated within Spark NLP, our models consistently outperform black-box commercial solutions while enabling scalable inference and seamless integration with medical NER, Relation Extraction, and Terminology Resolution. These results reinforce the importance of domain-adapted, transparent, and customizable clinical NLP solutions over general-purpose LLMs and proprietary APIs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumen Kumar Mondal, Sayambhu Sen, Abhishek Singhania, Preethi Jyothi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) aim towards robust natural language understanding across diverse languages, yet their performance significantly degrades on low-resource languages. This work explores whether existing techniques to identify language-specific neurons can be leveraged to enhance cross-lingual task performance of lowresource languages. We conduct detailed experiments covering existing language-specific neuron identification techniques (such as Language Activation Probability Entropy and activation probability-based thresholding) and neuron-specific LoRA fine-tuning with models like Llama 3.1 and Mistral Nemo. We find that such neuron-specific interventions are insufficient to yield cross-lingual improvements on downstream tasks (XNLI, XQuAD) in lowresource languages. This study highlights the challenges in achieving cross-lingual generalization and provides critical insights for multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lama Ayash, Hassan Alhuzali, Ashwag Alasmari, Sultan Aloufi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing; however, they often struggle to accurately capture and reflect cultural nuances. This research addresses this challenge by focusing on Saudi Arabia, a country characterized by diverse dialects and rich cultural traditions. We introduce SaudiCulture, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural competence of LLMs within the distinct geographical and cultural contexts of Saudi Arabia. SaudiCulture is a comprehensive dataset of questions covering five major geographical regions, such as West, East, South, North, and Center, along with general questions applicable across all regions. The dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of cultural domains, including food, clothing, entertainment, celebrations, and crafts. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, SaudiCulture includes questions of varying complexity, such as open-ended, single-choice, and multiple-choice formats, with some requiring multiple correct answers. Additionally, the dataset distinguishes between common cultural knowledge and specialized regional aspects. We conduct extensive evaluations on five LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama 3.3, FANAR, Jais, and AceGPT, analyzing their performance across different question types and cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that all models experience significant performance declines when faced with highly specialized or region-specific questions, particularly those requiring multiple correct responses. Additionally, certain cultural categories are more easily identifiable than others, further highlighting inconsistencies in LLMs cultural understanding. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating region-specific knowledge into LLMs training to enhance their cultural competence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17489">Judge Anything: MLLM as a Judge Across Any Modality</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shu Pu, Yaochen Wang, Dongping Chen, Yuhang Chen, Guohao Wang, Qi Qin, Zhongyi Zhang, Zhiyuan Zhang, Zetong Zhou, Shuang Gong, Yi Gui, Yao Wan, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17509">Follow-up Question Generation For Enhanced Patient-Provider Conversations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Gatto, Parker Seegmiller, Timothy Burdick, Inas S. Khayal, Sarah DeLozier, Sarah M. Preum</p>
<p>Abstract: Follow-up question generation is an essential feature of dialogue systems as it can reduce conversational ambiguity and enhance modeling complex interactions. Conversational contexts often pose core NLP challenges such as (i) extracting relevant information buried in fragmented data sources, and (ii) modeling parallel thought processes. These two challenges occur frequently in medical dialogue as a doctor asks questions based not only on patient utterances but also their prior EHR data and current diagnostic hypotheses. Asking medical questions in asynchronous conversations compounds these issues as doctors can only rely on static EHR information to motivate follow-up questions.
  To address these challenges, we introduce FollowupQ, a novel framework for enhancing asynchronous medical conversation. FollowupQ is a multi-agent framework that processes patient messages and EHR data to generate personalized follow-up questions, clarifying patient-reported medical conditions. FollowupQ reduces requisite provider follow-up communications by 34%. It also improves performance by 17% and 5% on real and synthetic data, respectively. We also release the first public dataset of asynchronous medical messages with linked EHR data alongside 2,300 follow-up questions written by clinical experts for the wider NLP research community.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17514">Language Models May Verbatim Complete TextThey Were Not Explicitly Trained On</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ken Ziyu Liu, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Peter Kairouz, Sanmi Koyejo, Percy Liang, Nicolas Papernot</p>
<p>Abstract: An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large language model (LLM). A \emph{completion} test is often employed: check if the LLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a ground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member based on the $n$-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the dataset. In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership definition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are \emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still succeed. We find many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from scratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases include exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They showcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for membership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets that can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it, for any reasonable choice of $n$. Our findings highlight the inadequacy of $n$-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for auxiliary information available to the training algorithm.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17523">Bayesian Teaching Enables Probabilistic Reasoning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Linlu Qiu, Fei Sha, Kelsey Allen, Yoon Kim, Tal Linzen, Sjoerd van Steenkiste</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that the LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available, even less so than we find is the case for humans. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method endows the LLM with broader Bayesian reasoning skills. More generally, our results indicate that LLMs can learn about reasoning strategies effectively and generalize those skills to new domains, which in part explains LLMs' empirical success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suet-Ying Lam, Qingcheng Zeng, Jingyi Wu, Rob Voigt</p>
<p>Abstract: Whether large language models (LLMs) process language similarly to humans has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size - with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: General practitioners (GPs) serve as the cornerstone of primary healthcare systems by providing continuous and comprehensive medical services. However, due to community-oriented nature of their practice, uneven training and resource gaps, the clinical proficiency among GPs can vary significantly across regions and healthcare settings. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in clinical and medical applications, making them a promising tool for supporting general practice. However, most existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks focus on exam-style assessments-typically multiple-choice question-lack comprehensive assessment sets that accurately mirror the real-world scenarios encountered by GPs. To evaluate how effectively LLMs can make decisions in the daily work of GPs, we designed GPBench, which consists of both test questions from clinical practice and a novel evaluation framework. The test set includes multiple-choice questions that assess fundamental knowledge of general practice, as well as realistic, scenario-based problems. All questions are meticulously annotated by experts, incorporating rich fine-grained information related to clinical management. The proposed LLM evaluation framework is based on the competency model for general practice, providing a comprehensive methodology for assessing LLM performance in real-world settings. As the first large-model evaluation set targeting GP decision-making scenarios, GPBench allows us to evaluate current mainstream LLMs. Expert assessment and evaluation reveal that in areas such as disease staging, complication recognition, treatment detail, and medication usage, these models exhibit at least ten major shortcomings. Overall, existing LLMs are not yet suitable for independent use in real-world GP working scenarios without human oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Ji, Yixin Lian, Linxu Li, Jingsheng Gao, Weiyuan Li, Bin Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough progress in many dialogue generation tasks. However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Sahnan, David Corney, Irene Larraz, Giovanni Zagni, Ruben Miguez, Zhuohan Xie, Iryna Gurevych, Elizabeth Churchill, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Preslav Nakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic fact-checking aims to support professional fact-checkers by offering tools that can help speed up manual fact-checking. Yet, existing frameworks fail to address the key step of producing output suitable for broader dissemination to the general public: while human fact-checkers communicate their findings through fact-checking articles, automated systems typically produce little or no justification for their assessments. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We argue for the need to extend the typical automatic fact-checking pipeline with automatic generation of full fact-checking articles. We first identify key desiderata for such articles through a series of interviews with experts from leading fact-checking organizations. We then develop QRAFT, an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics the writing workflow of human fact-checkers. Finally, we assess the practical usefulness of QRAFT through human evaluations with professional fact-checkers. Our evaluation shows that while QRAFT outperforms several previously proposed text-generation approaches, it lags considerably behind expert-written articles. We hope that our work will enable further research in this new and important direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) plays a crucial role in assessing language learners' writing quality, reducing grading workload, and providing real-time feedback. Arabic AES systems are particularly challenged by the lack of annotated essay datasets. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformers to generate synthetic Arabic essay datasets for AES. We prompt an LLM to generate essays across CEFR proficiency levels and introduce controlled error injection using a fine-tuned Standard Arabic BERT model for error type prediction. Our approach produces realistic human-like essays, contributing a dataset of 3,040 annotated essays. Additionally, we develop a BERT-based auto-marking system for accurate and scalable Arabic essay evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving Arabic AES performance.</p>

We propose two key innovations: a context-efficient architecture that reduces token consumption through hierarchical section search, and a scenario-based dialogue generation methodology that effectively distills tool-using capabilities from larger models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our fine-tuned 8B parameter model substantially outperforms both untuned models and baseline approaches, in terms of DB faithfulness and preference. Our work offers valuable insights for researchers developing domain-specific language agents under practical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharan Maiya, Yinhong Liu, Ramit Debnath, Anna Korhonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as automated judges to evaluate text, but their effectiveness can be hindered by various unintentional biases. We propose using linear classifying probes, trained by leveraging differences between contrasting pairs of prompts, to directly access LLMs' latent knowledge and extract more accurate preferences. Through extensive experiments using models of varying size from four different families and six diverse datasets assessing text quality evaluation and common sense reasoning, we demonstrate that both supervised and unsupervised probing approaches consistently outperform traditional generation-based judgement while maintaining similar computational costs. These probes generalise under domain shifts and can even outperform finetuned evaluators with the same training data size. Our results suggest linear probing offers an accurate, robust and computationally efficient approach for LLM-as-judge tasks while providing interpretable insights into how models encode judgement-relevant knowledge. Our data and code will be openly released in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Jiang, Ramakanth Kavuluru</p>
<p>Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a standard information extraction task playing a major role in downstream applications such as knowledge discovery and question answering. Although decoder-only large language models are excelling in generative tasks, smaller encoder models are still the go to architecture for RE. In this paper, we revisit fine-tuning such smaller models using a novel dual-encoder architecture with a joint contrastive and cross-entropy loss. Unlike previous methods that employ a fixed linear layer for predicate representations, our approach uses a second encoder to compute instance-specific predicate representations by infusing them with real entity spans from corresponding input instances. We conducted experiments on two biomedical RE datasets and two general domain datasets. Our approach achieved F1 score improvements ranging from 1% to 2% over state-of-the-art methods with a simple but elegant formulation. Ablation studies justify the importance of various components built into the proposed architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of historical languages presents unique challenges due to their complex orthographic systems, fragmentary textual evidence, and the absence of standardized digital representations of text in those languages. Tackling these challenges needs special NLP digital tools to handle phonetic transcriptions and analyze ancient texts. This work introduces ParsiPy, an NLP toolkit designed to facilitate the analysis of historical Persian languages by offering modules for tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, phoneme-to-transliteration conversion, and word embedding. We demonstrate the utility of our toolkit through the processing of Parsig (Middle Persian) texts, highlighting its potential for expanding computational methods in the study of historical languages. Through this work, we contribute to computational philology, offering tools that can be adapted for the broader study of ancient texts and their digital preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Pei, Hailing Xu, Hengyuan Zhao, Shizheng Hou, Han Chen, Zining Zhang, Pingyi Luo, Bingsheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs). However, these models often depend on closed-source systems and high computational resources, posing challenges in data privacy and deployment. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) struggle with NL2SQL tasks, exhibiting poor performance and incompatibility with existing frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Faltings, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zuo, Jing Tang, Hanbing Qin, Binli Luo, Ligang He, Shiyan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries. However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations. This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL). TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases. Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context. The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information. Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs. The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities. Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components. In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyun Si, Xinpeng Wang, Guangyao Zhai, Nassir Navab, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that fine-tuning and human alignment can render LLMs harmless. In practice, such "harmlessness" behavior is mainly achieved by training models to reject harmful requests, such as "Explain how to burn down my neighbor's house", where the model appropriately declines to respond. However, this approach can inadvertently result in false refusal, where models reject benign queries as well, such as "Tell me how to kill a Python process". In this work, we demonstrate that prompting safety reflection before generating a response can mitigate false refusal behavior. Building on this finding, we introduce the Think-Before-Refusal (TBR) schema and conduct safety-aware instruction fine-tuning incorporating safety reflection. In an ablation study across 15 pre-trained models, we show that models fine-tuned with safety reflection significantly reduce false refusal behavior while maintaining safety and overall performance compared to those fine-tuned without safety reflection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce MedPlan, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youhui Zuo, Sibo Wei, Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Wenpeng Lu, Dawei Song</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their safety mechanisms. While existing defense methods either suffer from adaptive attacks or require computationally expensive auxiliary models, we present STShield, a lightweight framework for real-time jailbroken judgement. STShield introduces a novel single-token sentinel mechanism that appends a binary safety indicator to the model's response sequence, leveraging the LLM's own alignment capabilities for detection. Our framework combines supervised fine-tuning on normal prompts with adversarial training using embedding-space perturbations, achieving robust detection while preserving model utility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STShield successfully defends against various jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the model's performance on legitimate queries. Compared to existing approaches, STShield achieves superior defense performance with minimal computational overhead, making it a practical solution for real-world LLM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justice Ou, Tinglin Huang, Yilun Zhao, Ziyang Yu, Peiqing Lu, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: To improve the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively applied to provide factual medical knowledge. However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences. Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval Augmentation - ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record (EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning. To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17936">An Empirical Study of the Role of Incompleteness and Ambiguity in Interactions with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Riya Naik, Ashwin Srinivasan, Estrid He, Swati Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language as a medium for human-computer interaction has long been anticipated, has been undergoing a sea-change with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with startling capacities for processing and generating language. Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles, asking it almost any kind of question. Unlike its Delphic predecessor, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single-turn activity (ask a question, receive an answer, leave); and -- also unlike the Pythia -- it is widely acknowledged that answers from LLMs can be improved with additional context. In this paper, we aim to study when we need multi-turn interactions with LLMs to successfully get a question answered; or conclude that a question is unanswerable. We present a neural symbolic framework that models the interactions between human and LLM agents. Through the proposed framework, we define incompleteness and ambiguity in the questions as properties deducible from the messages exchanged in the interaction, and provide results from benchmark problems, in which the answer-correctness is shown to depend on whether or not questions demonstrate the presence of incompleteness or ambiguity (according to the properties we identify). Our results show multi-turn interactions are usually required for datasets which have a high proportion of incompleteness or ambiguous questions; and that that increasing interaction length has the effect of reducing incompleteness or ambiguity. The results also suggest that our measures of incompleteness and ambiguity can be useful tools for characterising interactions with an LLM on question-answeringproblems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansh Singh, Manuel Nunez Martinez, Bonnie J. Dorr, Sonja Schmer Galunder</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing accurate knowledge graphs from long texts and low-resource languages is challenging, as large language models (LLMs) experience degraded performance with longer input chunks. This problem is amplified in low-resource settings where data scarcity hinders accurate entity and relationship extraction. Contextual retrieval methods, while improving retrieval accuracy, struggle with long documents. They truncate critical information in texts exceeding maximum context lengths of LLMs, significantly limiting knowledge graph construction. We introduce SLIDE (Sliding Localized Information for Document Extraction), a chunking method that processes long documents by generating local context through overlapping windows. SLIDE ensures that essential contextual information is retained, enhancing knowledge graph extraction from documents exceeding LLM context limits. It significantly improves GraphRAG performance, achieving a 24% increase in entity extraction and a 39% improvement in relationship extraction for English. For Afrikaans, a low-resource language, SLIDE achieves a 49% increase in entity extraction and an 82% improvement in relationship extraction. Furthermore, it improves upon state-of-the-art in question-answering metrics such as comprehensiveness, diversity and empowerment, demonstrating its effectiveness in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beining Xu, Arkaitz Zubiaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xue, Haoyi Zhou, Tianyu Chen, Shuai Zhang, Yizhou Long, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications. Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyuyoung Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Jaehyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization in large language models (LLMs) seeks to tailor models to individual user or user group preferences. Prompt-based methods augment queries with user preference information, whereas training-based methods directly encode preferences into model parameters for more effective personalization. Despite achieving some success in personalizing LLMs, prior methods often fail to directly optimize task-specific metrics and lack explicit privacy-preservation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose Privacy-Preserving Model Merging via Evolutionary Algorithms (PriME), a novel approach to personalization that employs gradient-free methods to directly optimize task-specific metrics while preserving user privacy. By incorporating privacy preservation into optimization, PriME produces a personalized module that effectively captures the target user's preferences while minimizing the privacy risks for the users sharing their private information. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that PriME outperforms both prompt-based and training-based methods, achieving up to a 45% performance improvement over the prior art. Further analysis shows that PriME achieves a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off, highlighting the potential of evolutionary approaches for privacy-preserving LLM personalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks; however, their effectiveness for low-resource languages like Vietnamese remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we fine-tune and evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs: Llama 3 (8B parameters) and Gemma (7B parameters), on ViMMRC, a Vietnamese MRC dataset. By utilizing Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), we efficiently fine-tune these models and compare their performance against powerful LLM-based baselines. Although our fine-tuned models are smaller than GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, they outperform both traditional BERT-based approaches and these larger models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our fine-tuning process, showcasing how modern LLMs can surpass the capabilities of older models like BERT while still being suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Through intensive analyses, we explore various aspects of model performance, providing valuable insights into adapting LLMs for low-resource languages like Vietnamese.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pieyi Zhang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task prompt tuning utilizes multiple high-resource source tasks to improve performance on low-source target tasks. Existing approaches transfer the soft prompt trained by combining all source tasks or a single ``high-similar'' source task one-time-only. However, we find that the optimal transfer performance often comes from a combination of source tasks, which is neither one nor all. Further, we find that the similarity between source and target tasks also changes dynamically during fine-tuning after transfering, making similarity calculation in the initiation stage inadequate. To address these issues, we propose a method called Dynamic Task Vector Grouping (DTVG), whose core ideas contain (1) measuring the task similarity with task vectors instead of soft prompt, (2) grouping the optimal source task combination based on two metrics: {\it target similarity} and {\it knowledge consistency}; (3) dynamically updating the combination in each iteration step. Extensive experiments on the 26 NLP datasets under different settings demonstrate that DTVG effectively groups similar source tasks while reducing negative transfer, achieving the start-of-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si Shen, Fei Huang, Zhixiao Zhao, Chang Liu, Tiansheng Zheng, Danhao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Difficult problems, which often result in long reasoning traces, are widely recognized as key factors for enhancing the performance of reasoning models. However, such high-challenge problems are scarce, limiting the size of available datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple method to decouple the reliance on problem difficulty. First, we empirically demonstrate that reasoning length, rather than problem difficulty, primarily influences the performance of trained models. Second, we identify a scaling law on reasoning length, showing that model performance increases in a log-linear fashion as the reasoning data length grows. Finally, we introduce a straightforward technique to generate reasoning data of arbitrary length, and show that synthesized data is effective for training reasoning models. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on our Long1K dataset, we present our model, Long1K-32B, which achieves remarkable performance with only 1,000 training samples, achieving 95.6\% accuracy on MATH, and 71.1\% on GPQA outperforming DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Lin, Yifei Gao, Xian Zhao, Yunfan Yang, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have recently advanced into the realm of reasoning, yet it is through multimodal reasoning that we can fully unlock the potential to achieve more comprehensive, human-like cognitive capabilities. This survey provides a systematic overview of the recent multimodal reasoning approaches, categorizing them into two levels: language-centric multimodal reasoning and collaborative multimodal reasoning. The former encompasses one-pass visual perception and active visual perception, where vision primarily serves a supporting role in language reasoning. The latter involves action generation and state update within reasoning process, enabling a more dynamic interaction between modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the technical evolution of these methods, discuss their inherent challenges, and introduce key benchmark tasks and evaluation metrics for assessing multimodal reasoning performance. Finally, we provide insights into future research directions from the following two perspectives: (i) from visual-language reasoning to omnimodal reasoning and (ii) from multimodal reasoning to multimodal agents. This survey aims to provide a structured overview that will inspire further advancements in multimodal reasoning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Germ\'an Capdehourat, Isabel Amigo, Brian Lorenzo, Joaqu\'in Trigo</p>
<p>Abstract: Grading is a time-consuming and laborious task that educators must face. It is an important task since it provides feedback signals to learners, and it has been demonstrated that timely feedback improves the learning process. In recent years, the irruption of LLMs has shed light on the effectiveness of automatic grading. In this paper, we explore the performance of different LLMs and prompting techniques in automatically grading short-text answers to open-ended questions. Unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on a use case where the questions, answers, and prompts are all in Spanish. Experimental results comparing automatic scores to those of human-expert evaluators show good outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision and consistency for advanced LLMs, both open and proprietary. Results are notably sensitive to prompt styles, suggesting biases toward certain words or content in the prompt. However, the best combinations of models and prompt strategies, consistently surpasses an accuracy of 95% in a three-level grading task, which even rises up to more than 98% when the it is simplified to a binary right or wrong rating problem, which demonstrates the potential that LLMs have to implement this type of automation in education applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnath Roy, Padharthi Sreekar, Srivatsa Narasimha, Anubhav Anand</p>
<p>Abstract: The current study introduces a novel adaptation of speculative decoding, repurposed from generation to classification tasks. We propose a multi-model framework employing up to three lightweight worker models and a single, more robust judge model analogous to draft models and target model, respectively, in speculative decoding. The worker models, tasked with the bulk of the computation, independently predict discrete class labels for a given input. When majority worker models agree on a label, it is accepted as the final label, optimizing efficiency by bypassing the computationally expensive judge model. In cases of disagreement, the judge model intervenes to resolve the label. This approach minimizes redundant computation, leverages the redundancy of multiple workers for confidence, and confines the judge model's role to challenging cases, offering a practical balance of efficiency and accuracy. Our analysis suggests that smaller out of the box instruction/chat finetuned worker models with 3 billion parameters (hereafter, 3B) demonstrate a level of alignment with judge models comparable to that of larger finetuned worker models with 7 billion parameters (hereafter, 7B) across both simple and higher order reasoning tasks. The top performing 3B worker model pair achieve an agreement rate of approximately 80-83% for sentiment and around 50-80% for similar ticket when compared to judge models. Additionally, 3B worker models provide a speedup ranging from 2.8x to 9x relative to the judge models, while 7B worker model combinations achieve a speedup ranging from 1.28x to 0.28x</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rochana Chaturvedi, Peyman Baghershahi, Sourav Medya, Barbara Di Eugenio</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal information extraction from unstructured text is essential for contextualizing events and deriving actionable insights, particularly in the medical domain. We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javad SeraJ, Mohammad Mahdi Mohajeri, Mohammad Javad Dousti</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuning large language models is essential for optimizing their performance across diverse applications, particularly in scenarios with limited data availability. Tuning large language models in scarce data scenarios is crucial, particularly given that the convergence speed of the LoRA method is lower than that of full fine-tuning. In this paper, we present an analysis of post-training methods including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) within the context of task-specific learning using the LoRA method. Next we introduce $D^2LoRA$, a data-driven approach for initializing LoRA metrics that enhances training efficiency, especially in limited-data settings. Our experiments compare $D^2LoRA$ with vanilla LoRA in terms of performance and catastrophic forgetting under extremely data-constrained conditions. The results demonstrate that $D^2LoRA$ achieves a 1% improvement GSM8K benchmark and a 2-point improvement in ROUGE score in title generation tasks. $D^2LoRA$ facilitates the adaptation of LLMs to multiple tasks even when task-specific data is scarce, thereby reducing training expenses and offering data cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorena G Barberia, Belinda Lombard, Norton Trevisan Roman, Tatiane C. M. Sousa</p>
<p>Abstract: Background Advances in machine learning (ML) models have increased the capability of researchers to detect vaccine hesitancy in social media using Natural Language Processing (NLP). A considerable volume of research has identified the persistence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in discourse shared on various social media platforms. Methods Our objective in this study was to conduct a systematic review of research employing sentiment analysis or stance detection to study discourse towards COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination spread on Twitter (officially known as X since 2023). Following registration in the PROSPERO international registry of systematic reviews, we searched papers published from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2023 that used supervised machine learning to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy through stance detection or sentiment analysis on Twitter. We categorized the studies according to a taxonomy of five dimensions: tweet sample selection approach, self-reported study type, classification typology, annotation codebook definitions, and interpretation of results. We analyzed if studies using stance detection report different hesitancy trends than those using sentiment analysis by examining how COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is measured, and whether efforts were made to avoid measurement bias. Results Our review found that measurement bias is widely prevalent in studies employing supervised machine learning to analyze sentiment and stance toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination. The reporting errors are sufficiently serious that they hinder the generalisability and interpretation of these studies to understanding whether individual opinions communicate reluctance to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Improving the reporting of NLP methods is crucial to addressing knowledge gaps in vaccine hesitancy discourse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhidin A. Mohamed, Shuab D. Ahmed, Yahye A. Isse, Hanad M. Mohamed, Fuad M. Hassan, Houssein A. Assowe</p>
<p>Abstract: The fact that everyone with a social media account can create and share content, and the increasing public reliance on social media platforms as a news and information source bring about significant challenges such as misinformation, fake news, harmful content, etc. Although human content moderation may be useful to an extent and used by these platforms to flag posted materials, the use of AI models provides a more sustainable, scalable, and effective way to mitigate these harmful contents. However, low-resourced languages such as the Somali language face limitations in AI automation, including scarce annotated training datasets and lack of language models tailored to their unique linguistic characteristics. This paper presents part of our ongoing research work to bridge some of these gaps for the Somali language. In particular, we created two human-annotated social-media-sourced Somali datasets for two downstream applications, fake news \& toxicity classification, and developed a transformer-based monolingual Somali language model (named SomBERTa) -- the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. SomBERTa is then fine-tuned and evaluated on toxic content, fake news and news topic classification datasets. Comparative evaluation analysis of the proposed model against related multilingual models (e.g., AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, etc) demonstrated that SomBERTa consistently outperformed these comparators in both fake news and toxic content classification tasks while achieving the best average accuracy (87.99%) across all tasks. This research contributes to Somali NLP by offering a foundational language model and a replicable framework for other low-resource languages, promoting digital and AI inclusivity and linguistic diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varvara Krechetova, Denis Kochedykov</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess seven leading commercial LLMs (Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and o3-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks across four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test hallucination rejection. We develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference implementations. Results show Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, with Claude models excelling on solvable tasks while OpenAI models better identify unsolvable scenarios. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming substantially more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources, providing one more standardized method for ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Yan, Shen Wang, Jiahao Huo, Philip S. Yu, Xuming Hu, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical error detection in educational settings presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring a sophisticated understanding of both visual and textual mathematical content along with complex reasoning capabilities. Though effective in mathematical problem-solving, MLLMs often struggle with the nuanced task of identifying and categorizing student errors in multimodal mathematical contexts. Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Adhya, Avishek Lahiri, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, Partha Pratim Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Negative sampling has emerged as an effective technique that enables deep learning models to learn better representations by introducing the paradigm of learn-to-compare. The goal of this approach is to add robustness to deep learning models to learn better representation by comparing the positive samples against the negative ones. Despite its numerous demonstrations in various areas of computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive study of the effect of negative sampling in an unsupervised domain like topic modeling has not been well explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different negative sampling strategies on neural topic models. We compare the performance of several popular neural topic models by incorporating a negative sampling technique in the decoder of variational autoencoder-based neural topic models. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that integrating negative sampling into topic models results in significant enhancements across multiple aspects, including improved topic coherence, richer topic diversity, and more accurate document classification. Manual evaluations also indicate that the inclusion of negative sampling into neural topic models enhances the quality of the generated topics. These findings highlight the potential of negative sampling as a valuable tool for advancing the effectiveness of neural topic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Chen, Sicheng Song, Kashun Shum, Yanna Lin, Rui Sheng, Huamin Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Misleading chart visualizations, which intentionally manipulate data representations to support specific claims, can distort perceptions and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Patel, Vansh Parikh, Om Patel, Agam Shah, Bhaskar Chaudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we apply topic modeling using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to uncover the underlying thematic structure and its evolution within the extensive body of COVID-19 research literature. NMF factorizes the document-term matrix into two non-negative matrices, effectively representing the topics and their distribution across the documents. This helps us see how strongly documents relate to topics and how topics relate to words. We describe the complete methodology which involves a series of rigorous pre-processing steps to standardize the available text data while preserving the context of phrases, and subsequently feature extraction using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), which assigns weights to words based on their frequency and rarity in the dataset. To ensure the robustness of our topic model, we conduct a stability analysis. This process assesses the stability scores of the NMF topic model for different numbers of topics, enabling us to select the optimal number of topics for our analysis. Through our analysis, we track the evolution of topics over time within the CORD-19 dataset. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the knowledge structure of the COVID-19 research landscape, providing a valuable resource for future research in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lakota, a critically endangered language of the Sioux people in North America, faces significant challenges due to declining fluency among younger generations. This paper introduces LakotaBERT, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for Lakota, aiming to support language revitalization efforts. Our research has two primary objectives: (1) to create a comprehensive Lakota language corpus and (2) to develop a customized LLM for Lakota. We compiled a diverse corpus of 105K sentences in Lakota, English, and parallel texts from various sources, such as books and websites, emphasizing the cultural significance and historical context of the Lakota language. Utilizing the RoBERTa architecture, we pre-trained our model and conducted comparative evaluations against established models such as RoBERTa, BERT, and multilingual BERT. Initial results demonstrate a masked language modeling accuracy of 51% with a single ground truth assumption, showcasing performance comparable to that of English-based models. We also evaluated the model using additional metrics, such as precision and F1 score, to provide a comprehensive assessment of its capabilities. By integrating AI and linguistic methodologies, we aspire to enhance linguistic diversity and cultural resilience, setting a valuable precedent for leveraging technology in the revitalization of other endangered indigenous languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkatesh Bollineni, Igor Crk, Eren Gultepe</p>
<p>Abstract: Accessing and gaining insight into the Rigveda poses a non-trivial challenge due to its extremely ancient Sanskrit language, poetic structure, and large volume of text. By using NLP techniques, this study identified topics and semantic connections of hymns within the Rigveda that were corroborated by seven well-known groupings of hymns. The 1,028 suktas (hymns) from the modern English translation of the Rigveda by Jamison and Brereton were preprocessed and sukta-level embeddings were obtained using, i) a novel adaptation of LSA, presented herein, ii) SBERT, and iii) Doc2Vec embeddings. Following an UMAP dimension reduction of the vectors, the network of suktas was formed using k-nearest neighbours. Then, community detection of topics in the sukta networks was performed with the Louvain, Leiden, and label propagation methods, whose statistical significance of the formed topics were determined using an appropriate null distribution. Only the novel adaptation of LSA using the Leiden method, had detected sukta topic networks that were significant (z = 2.726, p < .01) with a modularity score of 0.944. Of the seven famous sukta groupings analyzed (e.g., creation, funeral, water, etc.) the LSA derived network was successful in all seven cases, while Doc2Vec was not significant and failed to detect the relevant suktas. SBERT detected four of the famous suktas as separate groups, but mistakenly combined three of them into a single mixed group. Also, the SBERT network was not statistically significant.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) built from various sources are the foundation of today's NLP progress. Language representations learned by such models achieve strong performance across many tasks with datasets of varying sizes drawn from various sources. We explore a thorough analysis of domain and task adaptive continual pretraining approaches for low-resource African languages and a promising result is shown for the evaluated tasks. We create AfriSocial, a corpus designed for domain adaptive finetuning that passes through quality pre-processing steps. Continual pretraining PLMs using AfriSocial as domain adaptive pretraining (DAPT) data, consistently improves performance on fine-grained emotion classification task of 16 targeted languages from 1% to 28.27% macro F1 score. Likewise, using the task adaptive pertaining (TAPT) approach, further finetuning with small unlabeled but similar task data shows promising results. For example, unlabeled sentiment data (source) for fine-grained emotion classification task (target) improves the base model results by an F1 score ranging from 0.55% to 15.11%. Combining the two methods, DAPT + TAPT, achieves also better results than base models. All the resources will be available to improve low-resource NLP tasks, generally, as well as other similar domain tasks such as hate speech and sentiment tasks.</p>

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PAD synergizes effectively with the syntactic characteristics of the Korean language, mitigating the weaknesses of SMT and significantly improving model performance. Moreover, we reveal that PAD complements traditional data construction methods and enhances their effectiveness when combined. This innovative approach not only boosts model performance but also suggests a cost-efficient solution for resource-scarce languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tadesse Destaw Belay, Dawit Ketema Gete, Abinew Ali Ayele, Olga Kolesnikova, Grigori Sidorov, Seid Muhie Yimam</p>
<p>Abstract: In this digital world, people freely express their emotions using different social media platforms. As a result, modeling and integrating emotion-understanding models are vital for various human-computer interaction tasks such as decision-making, product and customer feedback analysis, political promotions, marketing research, and social media monitoring. As users express different emotions simultaneously in a single instance, annotating emotions in a multilabel setting such as the EthioEmo (Belay et al., 2025) dataset effectively captures this dynamic. Additionally, incorporating intensity, or the degree of emotion, is crucial, as emotions can significantly differ in their expressive strength and impact. This intensity is significant for assessing whether further action is necessary in decision-making processes, especially concerning negative emotions in applications such as healthcare and mental health studies.

Furthermore, we evaluate various state-of-the-art encoder-only Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide comprehensive benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahak Shah, Akaash Vishal Hazarika, Meetu Malhotra, Sachin C. Patil, Joshit Mohanty</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a field within NLP that has gained importance because it is applied in various areas such as; social media surveillance, customer feedback evaluation and market research. At the same time, distributed systems allow for effective processing of large amounts of data. Therefore, this paper examines how sentiment analysis converges with distributed systems by concentrating on different approaches, challenges and future investigations. Furthermore, we do an extensive experiment where we train sentiment analysis models using both single node configuration and distributed architecture to bring out the benefits and shortcomings of each method in terms of performance and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Huang, Fan Gao, Nyima Tashi, Yutong Liu, Xiangxiang Wang, Thupten Tsering, Ban Ma-bao, Renzeg Duojie, Gadeng Luosang, Rinchen Dongrub, Dorje Tashi, Xiao Feng, Yongbin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tibetan, a minority language in China, features a highly intricate grammatical structure, characterized by four verb tenses and a tense system with frequent irregularities, contributing to its extensive inflectional diversity. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in many domains. Despite the success in other fields, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like Tibetans, and the potential of LLMs for Tibetan culture is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of Tibetan culture as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. Simultaneously, the complexity and uniqueness of its grammatical structure, coupled with its status as a minority ethnic language, contribute to data scarcity, which remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Llama-Sunshine (Sun-Shine), the first large language model for Tibetan culture, which is expert in various Tibetan language processing tasks. Sun-Shine incorporates state-of-the-art model architectures optimized for Tibetan's linguistic features. We also propose TIB-STC, a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse Tibetan texts such as literature, religious scripts, news, and conversational data, which is also the first large-scale dataset for Tibetan culture. Though comprehensive experiments, Sun-Shine not only demonstrates a higher level of knowledge expertise for Tibetan culture but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in Tibetan language processing tasks, like language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and syntactic analysis. Moreover, it excels in low-resource scenarios, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul K. Mandal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the effectiveness of dataset cartography for extractive question answering on the SQuAD dataset. I begin by analyzing annotation artifacts in SQuAD and evaluate the impact of two adversarial datasets, AddSent and AddOneSent, on an ELECTRA-small model. Using training dynamics, I partition SQuAD into easy-to-learn, ambiguous, and hard-to-learn subsets. I then compare the performance of models trained on these subsets to those trained on randomly selected samples of equal size. Results show that training on cartography-based subsets does not improve generalization to the SQuAD validation set or the AddSent adversarial set. While the hard-to-learn subset yields a slightly higher F1 score on the AddOneSent dataset, the overall gains are limited. These findings suggest that dataset cartography provides little benefit for adversarial robustness in SQuAD-style QA tasks. I conclude by comparing these results to prior findings on SNLI and discuss possible reasons for the observed differences.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18293">Fact-checking AI-generated news reports: Can LLMs catch their own lies?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Yao, Haibo Sun, Nianwen Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the veracity of claims in ''news reports'' generated by themselves or other LLMs. Our goal is to determine whether LLMs can effectively fact-check their own content, using methods similar to those used to verify claims made by humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs are more effective at assessing claims in national or international news stories than in local news stories, better at evaluating static information than dynamic information, and better at verifying true claims compared to false ones. We hypothesize that this disparity arises because the former types of claims are better represented in the training data. Additionally, we find that incorporating retrieved results from a search engine in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setting significantly reduces the number of claims an LLM cannot assess. However, this approach also increases the occurrence of incorrect assessments, partly due to irrelevant or low-quality search results. This diagnostic study highlights the need for future research on fact-checking machine-generated reports to prioritize improving the precision and relevance of retrieved information to better support fact-checking efforts. Furthermore, claims about dynamic events and local news may require human-in-the-loop fact-checking systems to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengya Xu, Zhongzhen Huang, Jie Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, we introduce the Surgical Action Planning (SAP) task, which generates future action plans from visual inputs to address the absence of intraoperative predictive planning in current intelligent applications. SAP shows great potential for enhancing intraoperative guidance and automating procedures. However, it faces challenges such as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical progress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical video content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP, as they focus mainly on retrospective analysis. Challenges like data privacy, computational demands, and modality-specific constraints further highlight significant research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a Large Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts future actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language prompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical education, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill analysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory Module (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for action planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset using models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in next-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested zero-shot, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented to address data privacy concerns. Our experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3% higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Hu, Huanghai Liu, Qingjing Chen, Ning Zheng, Chong Wang, Yun Liu, Charles L. A. Clarke, Weixing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the scale and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, their applications in knowledge-intensive fields such as legal domain have garnered widespread attention. However, it remains doubtful whether these LLMs make judgments based on domain knowledge for reasoning. If LLMs base their judgments solely on specific words or patterns, rather than on the underlying logic of the language, the ''LLM-as-judges'' paradigm poses substantial risks in the real-world applications. To address this question, we propose a method of legal knowledge injection attacks for robustness testing, thereby inferring whether LLMs have learned legal knowledge and reasoning logic. In this paper, we propose J&H: an evaluation framework for detecting the robustness of LLMs under knowledge injection attacks in the legal domain. The aim of the framework is to explore whether LLMs perform deductive reasoning when accomplishing legal tasks. To further this aim, we have attacked each part of the reasoning logic underlying these tasks (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion generation). We have collected mistakes that legal experts might make in judicial decisions in the real world, such as typos, legal synonyms, inaccurate external legal statutes retrieval. However, in real legal practice, legal experts tend to overlook these mistakes and make judgments based on logic. However, when faced with these errors, LLMs are likely to be misled by typographical errors and may not utilize logic in their judgments. We conducted knowledge injection attacks on existing general and domain-specific LLMs. Current LLMs are not robust against the attacks employed in our experiments. In addition we propose and compare several methods to enhance the knowledge robustness of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsong Li, Jie Zhou, Yutao Yang, Bihao Zhan, Qianjun Pan, Yuyang Ding, Qin Chen, Jiang Bo, Xin Lin, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic math correction aims to check students' solutions to mathematical problems via artificial intelligence technologies. Most existing studies focus on judging the final answer at the problem level, while they ignore detailed feedback on each step in a math problem-solving process, which requires abilities of semantic understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to boost large language model (LLM) for step-level automatic math correction, named StepAMC. Particularly, we convert the step-level automatic math correction within the text classification task into an RL problem to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Then, we design a space-constrained policy network to improve the stability of RL. Then, we introduce a fine-grained reward network to convert the binary human feedback into a continuous value. We conduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets and the results show that our model outperforms the eleven strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Bao, Yow-Ting Shiue, Marine Carpuat, Joel Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scholars often explore literature outside of their home community of study. This exploration process is frequently hampered by field-specific jargon. Past computational work often focuses on supporting translation work by removing jargon through simplification and summarization; here, we explore a different approach that preserves jargon as useful bridges to new conceptual spaces. Specifically, we cast different scholarly domains as different language-using communities, and explore how to adapt techniques from unsupervised cross-lingual alignment of word embeddings to explore conceptual alignments between domain-specific word embedding spaces.We developed a prototype cross-domain search engine that uses aligned domain-specific embeddings to support conceptual exploration, and tested this prototype in two case studies. We discuss qualitative insights into the promises and pitfalls of this approach to translation work, and suggest design insights for future interfaces that provide computational support for cross-domain information seeking.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for Amharic, a low-resource language, to improve transcription accuracy. While the foundational Whisper model struggles with Amharic due to limited representation in its training data, we fine-tune it using datasets like Mozilla Common Voice, FLEURS, and the BDU-speech dataset. The best-performing model, Whispersmall-am, significantly improves when finetuned on a mix of existing FLEURS data and new, unseen Amharic datasets. Training solely on new data leads to poor performance, but combining it with FLEURS data reinforces the model, enabling better specialization in Amharic. We also demonstrate that normalizing Amharic homophones significantly enhances Word Error Rate (WER) and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores. This study underscores the importance of fine-tuning strategies and dataset composition for improving ASR in low-resource languages, providing insights for future Amharic speech recognition research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Siwen Luo, Soyeon Caren Han, Eduard Hovy</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often lack integrated commonsense knowledge, limiting their robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge base population KBP plays a crucial role in populating and maintaining knowledge bases up-to-date in organizations by leveraging domain corpora. Motivated by the increasingly large context windows supported by large language models, we propose to fine-tune an autoregressive language model for end-toend KPB. Our case study involves the population of a space mission knowledge graph. To fine-tune the model we generate a dataset for end-to-end KBP tapping into existing domain resources. Our case study shows that fine-tuned language models of limited size can achieve competitive and even higher accuracy than larger models in the KBP task. Smaller models specialized for KBP offer affordable deployment and lower-cost inference. Moreover, KBP specialist models do not require the ontology to be included in the prompt, allowing for more space in the context for additional input text or output serialization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Validating key claims in scientific literature, particularly in biomedical research, is essential for ensuring accuracy and advancing knowledge. This process is critical in sectors like the pharmaceutical industry, where rapid scientific progress requires automation and deep domain expertise. However, current solutions have significant limitations. They lack end-to-end pipelines encompassing all claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verification steps; rely on complex NLP and information retrieval pipelines prone to multiple failure points; and often fail to provide clear, user-friendly justifications for claim verification outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce SciClaims, an advanced system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) that seamlessly integrates the entire scientific claim analysis process. SciClaims outperforms previous approaches in both claim extraction and verification without requiring additional fine-tuning, setting a new benchmark for automated scientific claim analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) refers to the use of computational methods for extracting, processing, and analyzing unstructured clinical text data, and holds a huge potential to transform healthcare in various clinical tasks. Objective: The study aims to perform a systematic review to comprehensively assess and analyze the state-of-the-art NLP methods for the mainland Scandinavian clinical text. Method: A literature search was conducted in various online databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore between December 2022 and February 2024. Further, relevant references to the included articles were also used to solidify our search. The final pool includes articles that conducted clinical NLP in the mainland Scandinavian languages and were published in English between 2010 and 2024. Results: Out of the 113 articles, 18% (n=21) focus on Norwegian clinical text, 64% (n=72) on Swedish, 10% (n=11) on Danish, and 8% (n=9) focus on more than one language. Generally, the review identified positive developments across the region despite some observable gaps and disparities between the languages. There are substantial disparities in the level of adoption of transformer-based models. In essential tasks such as de-identification, there is significantly less research activity focusing on Norwegian and Danish compared to Swedish text. Further, the review identified a low level of sharing resources such as data, experimentation code, pre-trained models, and rate of adaptation and transfer learning in the region. Conclusion: The review presented a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art Clinical NLP for electronic health records (EHR) text in mainland Scandinavian languages and, highlighted the potential barriers and challenges that hinder the rapid advancement of the field in the region.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Wang, Peiyu Liu, Xin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in achieving human-level performance in Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in real-world large-scale multi-database scenarios. Addressing schema linking faces two major challenges: (1) Database Retrieval: selecting the correct database from a large schema pool in multi-database settings, while filtering out irrelevant ones. (2) Schema Item Grounding: accurately identifying the relevant tables and columns from within a large and redundant schema for SQL generation. To address this, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework that can effectively adapt existing baselines to real-world environments by systematically addressing schema linking. Our framework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema linking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark. Experiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in multi-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the other hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long chain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current research and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust and scalable schema linking.

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models have gained attention, many service developers still rely on embedding-based models due to practical constraints. In such cases, the quality of fine-tuning data directly impacts performance, and English datasets are often used as seed data for training non-English models. In this study, we propose LANGALIGN, which enhances target language processing by aligning English embedding vectors with those of the target language at the interface between the language model and the task header. Experiments on Korean, Japanese, and Chinese demonstrate that LANGALIGN significantly improves performance across all three languages. Additionally, we show that LANGALIGN can be applied in reverse to convert target language data into a format that an English-based model can process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen-Song Chen, Hong-Wei Ding, Xian-Jia Wang, Witold Pedrycz</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) provides a systematic framework for automating the design of neural network architectures, yet its widespread adoption is hindered by prohibitive computational requirements. Existing zero-cost proxy methods, while reducing search overhead, demonstrate inadequate performance in architecture ranking tasks, particularly for Transformer-based models where they often underperform simple parameter counting metrics. Current automated proxy discovery approaches suffer from extended search times, susceptibility to data overfitting, and structural complexity. This paper introduces a novel zero-cost proxy methodology that quantifies model capacity through efficient weight statistics computation while decomposing Transformer architectures into functionally distinct sub-modules, thereby optimizing the balance of their contributions to overall performance. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of this approach, achieving a Spearman's rho of 0.76 and Kendall's tau of 0.53 on the FlexiBERT benchmark. The proposed method exhibits exceptional computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across diverse NAS benchmark tasks, offering a practical solution for large-scale architecture search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yazhou Zhang, Chunwang Zou, Bo Wang, Jing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ph. Shakouri, Crit Cremers, Niels O. Schiller</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongkuan Zhou, Stefan Schmid, Yicong Li, Lavdim Halilaj, Xiangtong Yao, Wei cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving field has seen remarkable advancements in various topics, such as object recognition, trajectory prediction, and motion planning. However, current approaches face limitations in effectively comprehending the complex evolutions of driving scenes over time. This paper proposes FM4SU, a novel methodology for training a symbolic foundation model (FM) for scene understanding in autonomous driving. It leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture sensory observation along with domain knowledge such as road topology, traffic rules, or complex interactions between traffic participants. A bird's eye view (BEV) symbolic representation is extracted from the KG for each driving scene, including the spatio-temporal information among the objects across the scenes. The BEV representation is serialized into a sequence of tokens and given to pre-trained language models (PLMs) for learning an inherent understanding of the co-occurrence among driving scene elements and generating predictions on the next scenes. We conducted a number of experiments using the nuScenes dataset and KG in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy in all tasks. The fine-tuned T5 model achieved a next scene prediction accuracy of 86.7%. This paper concludes that FM4SU offers a promising foundation for developing more comprehensive models for scene understanding in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wesley Scivetti, Nathan Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Construction Grammar hypothesizes that knowledge of a language consists chiefly of knowledge of form-meaning pairs (''constructions'') that include vocabulary, general grammar rules, and even idiosyncratic patterns. Recent work has shown that transformer language models represent at least some constructional patterns, including ones where the construction is rare overall. In this work, we probe BERT's representation of the form and meaning of a minor construction of English, the NPN (noun-preposition-noun) construction -- exhibited in such expressions as face to face and day to day -- which is known to be polysemous. We construct a benchmark dataset of semantically annotated corpus instances (including distractors that superficially resemble the construction). With this dataset, we train and evaluate probing classifiers. They achieve decent discrimination of the construction from distractors, as well as sense disambiguation among true instances of the construction, revealing that BERT embeddings carry indications of the construction's semantics. Moreover, artificially permuting the word order of true construction instances causes them to be rejected, indicating sensitivity to matters of form. We conclude that BERT does latently encode at least some knowledge of the NPN construction going beyond a surface syntactic pattern and lexical cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick McKenna, Xinnuo Xu, Jack Williams, Nick Wilson, Benjamin Van Durme, Christian Poelitz</p>
<p>Abstract: A key consideration when training an LLM is whether the target language is more or less resourced, whether this is English compared to Welsh, or Python compared to Excel. Typical training data for programming languages consist of real program demonstrations coupled with human-written comments. Here we present novel approaches to the creation of such data for low resource programming languages. We generate fully-synthetic, textbook-quality demonstrations of common library functions in an example domain of Excel formulas, using a teacher model. We then finetune an underperforming student model, and show improvement on 2 question-answering datasets recast into the Excel domain. We show advantages of finetuning over standard, off-the-shelf RAG approaches, which can offer only modest improvement due to the unfamiliar target domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents AlphaSpace, a novel methodology designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for 3D Cartesian space navigation. AlphaSpace employs a semantics-based tokenization strategy, encoding height information through specialized semantic tokens, and integrates primarily symbolic synthetic reasoning data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrey Galichin, Alexey Dontsov, Polina Druzhinina, Anton Razzhigaev, Oleg Y. Rogov, Elena Tutubalina, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class of reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning mechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent representations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify features that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we propose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE representations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and interpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the model's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these features systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first mechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexuan Wang, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, Jie Liu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in collaborative problem-solving. However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents' communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable domain transferability and structure robustness, revealing its reliability and effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Chih Chang, Chien-Yu Lin, Yash Akhauri, Wei-Cheng Lin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference.

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) browser assistants integrate powerful capabilities of GenAI in web browsers to provide rich experiences such as question answering, content summarization, and agentic navigation. These assistants, available today as browser extensions, can not only track detailed browsing activity such as search and click data, but can also autonomously perform tasks such as filling forms, raising significant privacy concerns. It is crucial to understand the design and operation of GenAI browser extensions, including how they collect, store, process, and share user data. To this end, we study their ability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or inferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network traffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking, profiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant extensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these assistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked without explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage content, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs, with their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user prompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and sharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as health or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We find that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as age, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across browsing contexts--to personalize responses. In summary, our work shows that GenAI browser assistants can and do collect personal and sensitive information for profiling and personalization with little to no safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kiruluta, Andreas Lemos</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion based methods have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling. Although discrete diffusion for natural language processing has been explored to a lesser extent, it shows promise for tasks requiring iterative denoising of token based data. In standard approaches to text generation, transformers dominate, but their reliance on self attention often incurs high computational costs. This paper introduces a fully diffusion driven discrete text generation model built without any transformer or large convolution modules. Instead, the model integrates structured state space dynamics in the time domain with a novel Complex Fourier Multi Layer Perceptron module that operates in the frequency domain. The forward noising process randomly samples the vocabulary to replace tokens with a controlled probability, while the learned reverse model systematically reverts corrupted sequences toward their original states. By composing local state space updates with global Fourier based mixing, the approach effectively captures both short and long range dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Kuang, Liang Yang, Shaoze Cui, Weiguo Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Patients are increasingly turning to online health Q&A communities for social support to improve their well-being. However, when this support received does not align with their specific needs, it may prove ineffective or even detrimental. This necessitates a model capable of identifying the social support needs in questions. However, training such a model is challenging due to the scarcity and class imbalance issues of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel framework, Hybrid Approach for SOcial Support need classification (HA-SOS). HA-SOS integrates an answer-enhanced semi-supervised learning approach, a text data augmentation technique leveraging large language models (LLMs) with reliability- and diversity-aware sample selection mechanism, and a unified training process to automatically label social support needs in questions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that HA-SOS significantly outperforms existing question classification models and alternative semi-supervised learning approaches. This research contributes to the literature on social support, question classification, semi-supervised learning, and text data augmentation. In practice, our HA-SOS framework facilitates online Q&A platform managers and answerers to better understand users' social support needs, enabling them to provide timely, personalized answers and interventions.</p>

Our approach represents candidate profiles as multimodal embeddings, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between job requirements and candidate attributes. The proposed approach has significant implications for the recruitment industry, enabling companies to streamline their hiring processes and identify top talent more efficiently.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Owen, Abhay Kumar, Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury, Fabian G\"ura</p>
<p>Abstract: The outcome of Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training strongly depends on weight initialization and variance control strategies. Although the importance of initial variance control has been well documented in neural networks in general, the literature on initialization and management of its growth during LLM pre-training, specifically, is somewhat sparse. In this paper, we introduce the Layer Index Rescaling (LIR) weight initialization scheme, and the Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) variance control strategy. Experiments on a 1B parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that better variance management using these techniques yields substantial improvements in downstream task performance (up to 4.6% on common pre-training benchmarks) and reduces extreme activation values, thus mitigating challenges associated with quantization and low-precision training.

<p>Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process, often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA), an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in 20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations. The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified 0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical implementation and workflow improvement.</p>

We present a new debiasing framework called ``FairFlow'' that mitigates dataset biases by learning to be undecided in its predictions for data samples or representations associated with known or unknown biases. The framework introduces two key components: a suite of data and model perturbation operations that generate different biased views of input samples, and a contrastive objective that learns debiased and robust representations from the resulting biased views of samples. Experiments show that FairFlow outperforms existing debiasing methods, particularly against out-of-domain and hard test samples without compromising the in-domain performance</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in the field of video understanding recently. However, current benchmarks uniformly lean on text prompts for evaluation, which often necessitate complex referential language and fail to provide precise spatial and temporal references. This limitation diminishes the experience and efficiency of human-model interaction. To address this limitation, we propose the Video Visual Prompt Benchmark(V2P-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' video understanding capabilities in multimodal human-model interaction scenarios. V2P-Bench includes 980 unique videos and 1,172 QA pairs, covering 5 main tasks and 12 dimensions, facilitating instance-level fine-grained understanding aligned with human cognition. Benchmarking results reveal that even the most powerful models perform poorly on V2P-Bench (65.4% for GPT-4o and 67.9% for Gemini-1.5-Pro), significantly lower than the human experts' 88.3%, highlighting the current shortcomings of LVLMs in understanding video visual prompts. We hope V2P-Bench will serve as a foundation for advancing multimodal human-model interaction and video understanding evaluation. Project page: https://github.com/gaotiexinqu/V2P-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in code large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation and understanding. It is still challenging to build a code LLM with comprehensive performance yet ultimate efficiency. Many attempts have been released in the open source community to break the trade-off between performance and efficiency, such as the Qwen Coder series and the DeepSeek Coder series. This paper introduces yet another attempt in this area, namely Ling-Coder-Lite. We leverage the efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture along with a set of high-quality data curation methods (especially those based on program analytics) to build an efficient yet powerful code LLM. Ling-Coder-Lite exhibits on-par performance on 12 representative coding benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models of similar size, such as Qwen2.5-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite, while offering competitive latency and throughput. In practice, we achieve a 50\% reduction in deployment resources compared to the similar-sized dense model without performance loss. To facilitate further research and development in this area, we open-source our models as well as a substantial portion of high-quality data for the annealing and post-training stages.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in various tasks, yet often struggle with modality bias, where the model tends to rely heavily on a single modality and overlook critical information in other modalities, which leads to incorrect focus and generating irrelevant responses. In this paper, we propose using the paradigm of preference optimization to solve the modality bias problem, including RLAIFVBias, a debiased preference optimization dataset, and a Noise Aware Preference Optimization algorithm. Specifically, we first construct the dataset by introducing perturbations to reduce the informational content of certain modalities, compelling the model to rely on a specific modality when generating negative responses. To address the inevitable noise in automatically constructed data, we combine the noise robust Mean Absolute Error with the Binary Cross Entropy in Direct Preference Optimization by a negative Box Cox transformation, and dynamically adjust the algorithm noise robustness based on the evaluated noise levels in the data. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating not only its effectiveness in mitigating modality bias but also its significant role in minimizing hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Pasch, Sun-Young Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-AI Interaction (HAI) guidelines and design principles have become increasingly important in both industry and academia to guide the development of AI systems that align with user needs and expectations. However, large-scale empirical evidence on how HAI principles shape user satisfaction in practice remains limited. This study addresses that gap by analyzing over 100,000 user reviews of AI-related products from G2.com, a leading review platform for business software and services. Based on widely adopted industry guidelines, we identify seven core HAI dimensions and examine their coverage and sentiment within the reviews. We find that the sentiment on four HAI dimensions-adaptability, customization, error recovery, and security-is positively associated with overall user satisfaction. Moreover, we show that engagement with HAI dimensions varies by professional background: Users with technical job roles are more likely to discuss system-focused aspects, such as reliability, while non-technical users emphasize interaction-focused features like customization and feedback. Interestingly, the relationship between HAI sentiment and overall satisfaction is not moderated by job role, suggesting that once an HAI dimension has been identified by users, its effect on satisfaction is consistent across job roles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixiang Zhao, Xingyu Sui, Jiahe Guo, Yulin Hu, Yang Deng, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Wanxiang Che, Tat-Seng Chua, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance in specialized reasoning tasks through human-like deliberative thinking and long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, our systematic evaluation across various model families (DeepSeek, Qwen, and LLaMA) and scales (7B to 671B) reveals that acquiring these deliberative reasoning capabilities significantly reduces the foundational capabilities of LRMs, including notable declines in helpfulness and harmlessness, alongside substantially increased inference costs. Importantly, we demonstrate that adaptive reasoning -- employing modes like Zero-Thinking, Less-Thinking, and Summary-Thinking -- can effectively alleviate these drawbacks. Our empirical insights underline the critical need for developing more versatile LRMs capable of dynamically allocating inference-time compute according to specific task characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liang, Yanjiang Liu, Ben He, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Jia Zheng, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yingfei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Does the prior knowledge of the vision encoder constrain the capability boundary of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? While most existing research treats MLLMs as unified systems optimized through end-to-end training, the impact of vision encoder's prior knowledge is seldom investigated. In this work, we introduce a novel metric, $Rank_e$, to quantify the effect of the vision encoder's prior knowledge on MLLM performance. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between prior knowledge and MLLM performance. Moreover, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning using solely end-to-end visual question answering (VQA) data is insufficient--particularly for entities with low inherent visual prior knowledge. To address this issue, we propose VisPRE (Vision Prior Remediation), a two-stage training framework that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge at the vision encoder level. Experimental results demonstrate that augmenting vision encoder's prior knowledge substantially boosts the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs, offering a novel and effective strategy for improving performance, especially in scenarios involving uncommon visual entities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose (G)I-DLE, a new approach to constrained decoding that leverages KL divergence minimization to preserve the intrinsic conditional probability distribution of autoregressive language models while excluding undesirable tokens. Unlike conventional methods that naively set banned tokens' logits to $-\infty$, which can distort the conversion from raw logits to posterior probabilities and increase output variance, (G)I-DLE re-normalizes the allowed token probabilities to minimize such distortion. We validate our method on the K2-Eval dataset, specifically designed to assess Korean language fluency, logical reasoning, and cultural appropriateness. Experimental results on Qwen2.5 models (ranging from 1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that G-IDLE not only boosts mean evaluation scores but also substantially reduces the variance of output quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Wei, Bingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Jiaqi Chen, Shikui Ma, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Schmidgall, Michael Moor</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in scientific discovery is rarely the result of a single "Eureka" moment, but is rather the product of hundreds of scientists incrementally working together toward a common goal. While existing agent workflows are capable of producing research autonomously, they do so in isolation, without the ability to continuously improve upon prior research results. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentRxiv-a framework that lets LLM agent laboratories upload and retrieve reports from a shared preprint server in order to collaborate, share insights, and iteratively build on each other's research. We task agent laboratories to develop new reasoning and prompting techniques and find that agents with access to their prior research achieve higher performance improvements compared to agents operating in isolation (11.4% relative improvement over baseline on MATH-500). We find that the best performing strategy generalizes to benchmarks in other domains (improving on average by 3.3%). Multiple agent laboratories sharing research through AgentRxiv are able to work together towards a common goal, progressing more rapidly than isolated laboratories, achieving higher overall accuracy (13.7% relative improvement over baseline on MATH-500). These findings suggest that autonomous agents may play a role in designing future AI systems alongside humans. We hope that AgentRxiv allows agents to collaborate toward research goals and enables researchers to accelerate discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Bini, Leander Girrbach, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Jing, Nanyi Fei, Zhiwu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), the instruction quality during the visual instruction tuning stage significantly influences the performance of modality alignment. In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed \textbf{Writing Manner}, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. We argue that there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models (LLMs) within LMMs. This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base LLMs and LMMs. To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions. The manual writing manner evaluation results demonstrate that our approach successfully minimizes the writing manner gap. By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL demonstrate enhanced resistance to hallucinations and non-trivial comprehensive improvements across all $15$ visual and language benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Xinwei Chen, Tianyou Song, Chengrui Zhou, Zhuoran Liu, Zhenyan Zhang, Jiangjian Guo, Qing Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, we found that LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot perform well on reasoning that requires multiple rounds of dialogue, especially when solving situation puzzles. Specifically, LLMs intend to ask very detailed questions focusing on a specific aspect or same/similar questions after several rounds of Q&As. To help LLMs get out of the above dilemma, we propose a novel external reformulation methodology, where the situation puzzle will be reformulated after several rounds of Q&A or when the LLMs raise an incorrect guess. Experiments show superior performance (e.g., win rate, number of question/guess attempts) of our method than directly using LLMs for solving situation puzzles, highlighting the potential of strategic problem reformulation to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junteng Liu, Weihao Zeng, Xiwen Zhang, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart understanding requires models to effectively analyze and reason about numerical data, textual elements, and complex visual components. Our observations reveal that the perception capabilities of existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) constitute a critical bottleneck in this process. In this study, we delve into this perception bottleneck by decomposing it into two components: the vision encoder bottleneck, where the visual representation may fail to encapsulate the correct information, and the extraction bottleneck, where the language model struggles to extract the necessary information from the provided visual representations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that (1) the information embedded within visual representations is substantially richer than what is typically captured by linear extractors, such as the widely used retrieval accuracy metric; (2) While instruction tuning effectively enhances the extraction capability of LVLMs, the vision encoder remains a critical bottleneck, demanding focused attention and improvement. Therefore, we further enhance the visual encoder to mitigate the vision encoder bottleneck under a contrastive learning framework. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates the perception bottleneck and improves the ability of LVLMs to comprehend charts.

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, surpassing prior differentiable rendering methods in both quality and efficiency. However, its training process suffers from coupled opacity-color optimization that frequently converges to local minima, producing floater artifacts that degrade visual fidelity. We present StableGS, a framework that eliminates floaters through cross-view depth consistency constraints while introducing a dual-opacity GS model to decouple geometry and material properties of translucent objects. To further enhance reconstruction quality in weakly-textured regions, we integrate DUSt3R depth estimation, significantly improving geometric stability. Our method fundamentally addresses 3DGS training instabilities, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods across open-source datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Deng, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved remarkable success across various fields. However, there are few studies on 3D indoor scene generation with VLMs. This paper considers this task as a planning problem subject to spatial and layout common sense constraints. To solve the problem with a VLM, we propose a new global-local tree search algorithm. Globally, the method places each object sequentially and explores multiple placements during each placement process, where the problem space is represented as a tree. To reduce the depth of the tree, we decompose the scene structure hierarchically, i.e. room level, region level, floor object level, and supported object level. The algorithm independently generates the floor objects in different regions and supported objects placed on different floor objects. Locally, we also decompose the sub-task, the placement of each object, into multiple steps. The algorithm searches the tree of problem space. To leverage the VLM model to produce positions of objects, we discretize the top-down view space as a dense grid and fill each cell with diverse emojis to make to cells distinct. We prompt the VLM with the emoji grid and the VLM produces a reasonable location for the object by describing the position with the name of emojis. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results illustrate our approach generates more plausible 3D scenes than state-of-the-art approaches.

It includes the vision setting where text and queries are embedded in images, requiring LVLMs to simultaneously "see", "read", and "think", aligning with real-world applications. Additionally, PM\textsuperscript{4}Bench incorporates safety evaluations, addressing critical oversight in existing multilingual benchmarks. Using PM4Bench, we evaluate 11 mainstream LVLMs, revealing significant cross-linguistic performance disparities, particularly in vision settings, and identifying OCR capability as a key determinant of these imbalances.

<p>Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs. These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL). This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent. effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant success of Large Vision-Language models(LVLMs), these models still suffer hallucinations when describing images, generating answers that include non-existent objects. It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Christopher M. Poskitt, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danrui Li, Yichao Shi, Yaluo Wang, Ziying Shi, Mubbasir Kapadia</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently searching for relevant case studies is critical in architectural design, as designers rely on precedent examples to guide or inspire their ongoing projects. However, traditional text-based search tools struggle to capture the inherently visual and complex nature of architectural knowledge, often leading to time-consuming and imprecise exploration. This paper introduces ArchSeek, an innovative case study search system with recommendation capability, tailored for architecture design professionals. Powered by the visual understanding capabilities from vision-language models and cross-modal embeddings, it enables text and image queries with fine-grained control, and interaction-based design case recommendations. It offers architects a more efficient, personalized way to discover design inspirations, with potential applications across other visually driven design fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Jianyi Cheng, Ting Cao, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models, such as the GPT series, have driven significant industrial applications, leading to economic and societal transformations. However, a comprehensive understanding of their real-world applications remains limited. To address this, we introduce REALM, a dataset of over 94,000 LLM use cases collected from Reddit and news articles. REALM captures two key dimensions: the diverse applications of LLMs and the demographics of their users. It categorizes LLM applications and explores how users' occupations relate to the types of applications they use. By integrating real-world data, REALM offers insights into LLM adoption across different domains, providing a foundation for future research on their evolving societal roles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Fish, Julia Shephard, Minkai Li, Ran I. Shorrer, Yannai A. Gonczarowski</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop benchmarks for LLM agents that act in, learn from, and strategize in unknown environments, the specifications of which the LLM agent must learn over time from deliberate exploration. Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangjun Ruan, Neil Band, Chris J. Maddison, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the latent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming training on the same amount of raw data (5.7\% $\rightarrow$ 25.4\% on MATH). Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM bootstraps its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.</p>

The quality of geocoded data significantly impacts subsequent processes and applications, underscoring the need for next-generation systems. In response to this demand, this review first examines the evolving requirements for geocoding inputs and outputs across various scenarios these systems must address. It then provides a detailed analysis of how to construct such systems by breaking them down into key functional components and reviewing a broad spectrum of existing approaches, from traditional rule-based methods to advanced techniques in information retrieval, natural language processing, and large language models. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve next-generation geocoding systems in light of recent technological advances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zeng, Yuzhen Huang, Qian Liu, Wei Liu, Keqing He, Zejun Ma, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Ruifeng Yuan, Wenjie Wang, Zhen Zhang, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative retrieval has emerged as a novel paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to autoregressively generate document identifiers. Although promising, the mechanisms that underpin its performance and scalability remain largely unclear. We conduct a systematic investigation of training and inference scaling laws in generative retrieval, exploring how model size, training data scale, and inference-time compute jointly influence retrieval performance. To address the lack of suitable metrics, we propose a novel evaluation measure inspired by contrastive entropy and generation loss, providing a continuous performance signal that enables robust comparisons across diverse generative retrieval methods. Our experiments show that n-gram-based methods demonstrate strong alignment with both training and inference scaling laws, especially when paired with larger LLMs. Furthermore, increasing inference computation yields substantial performance gains, revealing that generative retrieval can significantly benefit from higher compute budgets at inference. Across these settings, LLaMA models consistently outperform T5 models, suggesting a particular advantage for larger decoder-only models in generative retrieval. Taken together, our findings underscore that model sizes, data availability, and inference computation interact to unlock the full potential of generative retrieval, offering new insights for designing and optimizing future systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weighted pushdown automata (WPDAs) are at the core of many natural language processing tasks, like syntax-based statistical machine translation and transition-based dependency parsing. As most existing dynamic programming algorithms are designed for context-free grammars (CFGs), algorithms for PDAs often resort to a PDA-to-CFG conversion. In this paper, we develop novel algorithms that operate directly on WPDAs. Our algorithms are inspired by Lang's algorithm, but use a more general definition of pushdown automaton and either reduce the space requirements by a factor of $|\Gamma|$ (the size of the stack alphabet) or reduce the runtime by a factor of more than $|Q|$ (the number of states). When run on the same class of PDAs as Lang's algorithm, our algorithm is both more space-efficient by a factor of $|\Gamma|$ and more time-efficient by a factor of $|Q| \cdot |\Gamma|$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. LLMs' ability of general-purpose language understanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model's parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws \cite{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training}. The research area of LLMs, while very recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper, we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three popular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Autonomous Data Selection (AutoDS), a method that leverages base language models themselves as zero-shot "generative classifiers" to automatically curate high-quality mathematical texts. Unlike prior approaches that require human annotations or training a dedicated data filter, AutoDS relies solely on a model's logits to determine whether a given passage is mathematically informative and educational. By integrating AutoDS into a continual pretraining pipeline, we substantially boost downstream performance on challenging math benchmarks (MATH, GSM8K, and BBH) while using far fewer tokens than previous methods. Empirically, our approach achieves roughly a twofold improvement in pretraining token efficiency over strong baselines, underscoring the potential of self-directed data selection in enhancing mathematical reasoning. We release our curated AutoMathText dataset to facilitate future research in automated domain-specific data curation.

<p>Abstract: There is a rapid increase in the use of multimedia content in current social media platforms. One of the highly popular forms of such multimedia content are memes. While memes have been primarily invented to promote funny and buoyant discussions, malevolent users exploit memes to target individuals or vulnerable communities, making it imperative to identify and address such instances of hateful memes. Thus social media platforms are in dire need for active moderation of such harmful content. While manual moderation is extremely difficult due to the scale of such content, automatic moderation is challenged by the need of good quality annotated data to train hate meme detection algorithms. This makes a perfect pretext for exploring the power of modern day vision language models (VLMs) that have exhibited outstanding performance across various tasks. In this paper we study the effectiveness of VLMs in handling intricate tasks such as hate meme detection in a completely zero-shot setting so that there is no dependency on annotated data for the task. We perform thorough prompt engineering and query state-of-the-art VLMs using various prompt types to detect hateful/harmful memes. We further interpret the misclassification cases using a novel superpixel based occlusion method. Finally we show that these misclassifications can be neatly arranged into a typology of error classes the knowledge of which should enable the design of better safety guardrails in future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, showcasing impressive performance across various tasks.Despite the significant advancements in LLMs, their effective operation still relies heavily on human input to accurately guide the dialogue flow, with agent tuning being a crucial optimization technique that involves human adjustments to the model for better response to such guidance.Addressing this dependency, our work introduces the TinyAgent model, trained on a meticulously curated high-quality dataset. We also present the Collaborative Multi-Agent Tuning (CMAT) framework, an innovative system designed to augment language agent capabilities through adaptive weight updates based on environmental feedback. This framework fosters collaborative learning and real-time adaptation among multiple intelligent agents, enhancing their context-awareness and long-term memory. In this research, we propose a new communication agent framework that integrates multi-agent systems with environmental feedback mechanisms, offering a scalable method to explore cooperative behaviors.

<p>Abstract: We present a suite of experiments that allow us to understand the underlying challenges of language model adaptation to nonstandard text. We do so by designing interventions that approximate core features of user-generated text and their interactions with existing biases of language models. Applying our interventions during language model adaptation to nonstandard text variations, we gain important insights into when such adaptation is successful, as well as the aspects of text variation and noise that are particularly difficult for language models to handle. For instance, on text with character-level variation, out-of-the-box performance improves even with a few additional training examples but approaches a plateau, suggesting that more data is not the solution. In contrast, on text with variation involving new words or meanings, far more data is needed, but it leads to a massive breakthrough in performance. Our findings reveal that existing models lack the necessary infrastructure to handle diverse forms of nonstandard text, guiding the development of more resilient language modeling techniques. We make the code for our interventions, which can be applied to any English text data, publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Bamberger, Ofek Glick, Chaim Baskin, Yonatan Belinkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) struggle with linguistic understanding at the discourse level, even though discourse patterns such as coherence, cohesion, and narrative flow are prevalent in their pre-training data. To improve the discourse capabilities of LMs already at the pre-training stage, we introduce DEPTH, an encoder-decoder model that learns latent representations for sentences using a discourse-oriented pre-training objective. DEPTH combines hierarchical sentence representations with two objectives: (1) Sentence Un-Shuffling, and (2) Span-Corruption. Our approach trains the model to represent both sub-word-level and sentence-level dependencies over a pre-training corpora. When trained either from scratch or continuing from a pre-trained T5 checkpoint, DEPTH learns semantic and discourse-level representations faster than T5, outperforming it in span-corruption loss despite the additional sentence-un-shuffling objective. Evaluations on the GLUE, DiscoEval, and NI benchmarks demonstrate DEPTH's ability to quickly learn diverse downstream tasks, which require syntactic, semantic, and discourse capabilities. Our approach extends the discourse capabilities of T5, while minimally impacting other natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities in the resulting LM.

<p>Abstract: Homograph disambiguation, the task of distinguishing words with identical spellings but different meanings, poses a substantial challenge in natural language processing. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset tailored for Persian homograph disambiguation. Our work encompasses a thorough exploration of various embeddings, evaluated through the cosine similarity method and their efficacy in downstream tasks like classification. Our investigation entails training a diverse array of lightweight machine learning and deep learning models for phonograph disambiguation. We scrutinize the models' performance in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and F1 Score, thereby gaining insights into their respective strengths and limitations. The outcomes of our research underscore three key contributions. First, we present a newly curated Persian dataset, providing a solid foundation for future research in homograph disambiguation. Second, our comparative analysis of embeddings highlights their utility in different contexts, enriching the understanding of their capabilities. Third, by training and evaluating a spectrum of models, we extend valuable guidance for practitioners in selecting suitable strategies for homograph disambiguation tasks. In summary, our study unveils a new dataset, scrutinizes embeddings through diverse perspectives, and benchmarks various models for homograph disambiguation. These findings empower researchers and practitioners to navigate the intricate landscape of homograph-related challenges effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting high-dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global understanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangsheng Wang, Xiao Zhang, Juntao Lyu, Tianyu Hu, Huimin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-based reasoning methods like chain of thought (CoT) play a rising role in solving reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, the causal hallucinations between a step of reasoning and corresponding state transitions are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Gandikota, Sheridan Feucht, Samuel Marks, David Bau</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Erasure of Language Memory (ELM), an approach for concept-level unlearning built on the principle of matching the distribution defined by an introspective classifier. Our key insight is that effective unlearning should leverage the model's ability to evaluate its own knowledge, using the model itself as a classifier to identify and reduce the likelihood of generating content related to undesired concepts. ELM applies this framework to create targeted low-rank updates that reduce generation probabilities for concept-specific content while preserving the model's broader capabilities. We demonstrate ELM's efficacy on biosecurity, cybersecurity, and literary domain erasure tasks. Comparative analysis shows that ELM achieves superior performance across key metrics, including near-random scores on erased topic assessments, maintained coherence in text generation, preserved accuracy on unrelated benchmarks, and robustness under adversarial attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Yuan, Yi Cai, Junsheng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Joint Multimodal Entity-Relation Extraction (JMERE) is a challenging task that aims to extract entities and their relations from text-image pairs in social media posts. Existing methods for JMERE require large amounts of labeled data. However, gathering and annotating fine-grained multimodal data for JMERE poses significant challenges. Initially, we construct diverse and comprehensive multimodal few-shot datasets fitted to the original data distribution. To address the insufficient information in the few-shot setting, we introduce the \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{M}odel (KECPM) for JMERE. This method can effectively address the problem of insufficient information in the few-shot setting by guiding a large language model to generate supplementary background knowledge. Our proposed method comprises two stages: (1) a knowledge ingestion stage that dynamically formulates prompts based on semantic similarity guide ChatGPT generating relevant knowledge and employs self-reflection to refine the knowledge; (2) a knowledge-enhanced language model stage that merges the auxiliary knowledge with the original input and utilizes a transformer-based model to align with JMERE's required output format. We extensively evaluate our approach on a few-shot dataset derived from the JMERE dataset, demonstrating its superiority over strong baselines in terms of both micro and macro F$_1$ scores. Additionally, we present qualitative analyses and case studies to elucidate the effectiveness of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Weng, Haotian Wang, Tian Gao, Kewei Li, Shutong Niu, Jun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: In multimodal sentiment analysis, collecting text data is often more challenging than video or audio due to higher annotation costs and inconsistent automatic speech recognition (ASR) quality. To address this challenge, our study has developed a robust model that effectively integrates multimodal sentiment information, even in the absence of text modality. Specifically, we have developed a Double-Flow Self-Distillation Framework, including Unified Modality Cross-Attention (UMCA) and Modality Imagination Autoencoder (MIA), which excels at processing both scenarios with complete modalities and those with missing text modality. In detail, when the text modality is missing, our framework uses the LLM-based model to simulate the text representation from the audio modality, while the MIA module supplements information from the other two modalities to make the simulated text representation similar to the real text representation. To further align the simulated and real representations, and to enable the model to capture the continuous nature of sample orders in sentiment valence regression tasks, we have also introduced the Rank-N Contrast (RNC) loss function. When testing on the CMU-MOSEI, our model achieved outstanding performance on MAE and significantly outperformed other models when text modality is missing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Wenjie Wang, Fengbin Zhu, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task completion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience. Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.</p>

<p>Abstract: Factuality evaluation aims to detect factual errors produced by language models (LMs) and hence guide the development of more factual models. Towards this goal, we train a factuality evaluator, FenCE, that provides LM generators with claim-level factuality feedback. We conduct data augmentation on a combination of public judgment datasets to train FenCE to (1) generate textual critiques along with scores and (2) make claim-level judgment based on diverse source documents obtained by various tools. We then present a framework that leverages FenCE to improve the factuality of LM generators by constructing training data. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate responses, leverage FenCE to revise and score each response without introducing lesser-known facts, and train the generator by preferring highly scored revised responses. Experiments show that our data augmentation methods improve the evaluator's accuracy by 2.9% on LLM-AggreFact. With FenCE, we improve Llama2-7B-chat and Llama3-8B-chat's factuality rate by 16.86% and 14.45% on FActScore, outperforming state-of-the-art factuality finetuning methods by 8.83% and 6.96%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanu Kumar, Akhila Yesantarao Venkata, Shubhanshu Khandelwal, Bishal Santra, Parag Agrawal, Manish Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt optimization is essential for effective utilization of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical coding, the translation of unstructured clinical text into standardized medical codes, is a crucial but time-consuming healthcare practice. Though large language models (LLM) could automate the coding process and improve the efficiency of such tasks, interpretability remains paramount for maintaining patient trust. Current efforts in interpretability of medical coding applications rely heavily on label attention mechanisms, which often leads to the highlighting of extraneous tokens irrelevant to the ICD code. To facilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper leverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated representations from dense language model embeddings in superposition. Compared with common label attention mechanisms, our model goes beyond token-level representations by building an interpretable dictionary which enhances the mechanistic-based explanations for each ICD code prediction, even when the highlighted tokens are medically irrelevant. We show that dictionary features can steer model behavior, elucidate the hidden meanings of upwards of 90% of medically irrelevant tokens, and are human interpretable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rina Carines Cabral, Soyeon Caren Han, Areej Alhassan, Riza Batista-Navarro, Goran Nenadic, Josiah Poon</p>
<p>Abstract: Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition (DNER) presents a challenging problem where entities may be scattered across multiple non-adjacent tokens, making traditional sequence labelling approaches inadequate. Existing methods predominantly rely on custom tagging schemes to handle these discontinuous entities, resulting in models tightly coupled to specific tagging strategies and lacking generalisability across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose TriG-NER, a novel Triplet-Grid Framework that introduces a generalisable approach to learning robust token-level representations for discontinuous entity extraction. Our framework applies triplet loss at the token level, where similarity is defined by word pairs existing within the same entity, effectively pulling together similar and pushing apart dissimilar ones. This approach enhances entity boundary detection and reduces the dependency on specific tagging schemes by focusing on word-pair relationships within a flexible grid structure. We evaluate TriG-NER on three benchmark DNER datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over existing grid-based architectures. These results underscore our framework's effectiveness in capturing complex entity structures and its adaptability to various tagging schemes, setting a new benchmark for discontinuous entity extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lindia Tjuatja, Graham Neubig, Tal Linzen, Sophie Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: When comparing the linguistic capabilities of language models (LMs) with humans using LM probabilities, factors such as the length of the sequence and the unigram frequency of lexical items have a significant effect on LM probabilities in ways that humans are largely robust to. Prior works in comparing LM and human acceptability judgments treat these effects uniformly across models, making a strong assumption that models require the same degree of adjustment to control for length and unigram frequency effects. We propose MORCELA, a new linking theory between LM scores and acceptability judgments where the optimal level of adjustment for these effects is estimated from data via learned parameters for length and unigram frequency. We first show that MORCELA outperforms a commonly used linking theory for acceptability - SLOR (Pauls and Klein, 2012; Lau et al. 2017) - across two families of transformer LMs (Pythia and OPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assumed degrees of adjustment in SLOR for length and unigram frequency overcorrect for these confounds, and that larger models require a lower relative degree of adjustment for unigram frequency, though a significant amount of adjustment is still necessary for all models. Finally, our subsequent analysis shows that larger LMs' lower susceptibility to frequency effects can be explained by an ability to better predict rarer words in context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have been assessed for general medical knowledge using licensing exams, their ability to support clinical decision-making, such as selecting medical calculators, remains uncertain. We assessed nine LLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and domain-specific models, with 1,009 multiple-choice question-answer pairs across 35 clinical calculators and compared LLMs to humans on a subset of questions. While the highest-performing LLM, OpenAI o1, provided an answer accuracy of 66.0% (CI: 56.7-75.3%) on the subset of 100 questions, two human annotators nominally outperformed LLMs with an average answer accuracy of 79.5% (CI: 73.5-85.0%). Ultimately, we evaluated medical trainees and LLMs in recommending medical calculators across clinical scenarios like risk stratification and diagnosis. With error analysis showing that the highest-performing LLMs continue to make mistakes in comprehension (49.3% of errors) and calculator knowledge (7.1% of errors), our findings highlight that LLMs are not superior to humans in calculator recommendation.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) for social media platforms (i.e., X, Reddit) with more realistic large language model (LLM) agents, thereby allowing for a more nuanced study of complex systems. As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the past year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to study a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to explore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models simulate only a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms involve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and scalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social media platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (i.e., dynamic social networks and post information), diverse action spaces (i.e., following, commenting), and recommendation systems (i.e., interest-based and hot-score-based). Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale user simulations, capable of modeling up to one million users. With these features, OASIS can be easily extended to different social media platforms to study large-scale group phenomena and behaviors. We replicate various social phenomena, including information spreading, group polarization, and herd effects across X and Reddit platforms. Moreover, we provide observations of social phenomena at different agent group scales. We observe that the larger agent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and more diverse and helpful agents' opinions. These findings demonstrate OASIS's potential as a powerful tool for studying complex systems in digital environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duzhen Zhang, Yahan Yu, Chenxing Li, Jiahua Dong, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Named Entity Recognition (FNER) boosts model training within each local client by aggregating the model updates of decentralized local clients, without sharing their private data. However, existing FNER methods assume fixed entity types and local clients in advance, leading to their ineffectiveness in practical applications. In a more realistic scenario, local clients receive new entity types continuously, while new local clients collecting novel data may irregularly join the global FNER training. This challenging setup, referred to here as Federated Incremental NER, renders the global model suffering from heterogeneous forgetting of old entity types from both intra-client and inter-client perspectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Local-Global Forgetting Defense (LGFD) model. Specifically, to address intra-client forgetting, we develop a structural knowledge distillation loss to retain the latent space's feature structure and a pseudo-label-guided inter-type contrastive loss to enhance discriminative capability over different entity types, effectively preserving previously learned knowledge within local clients. To tackle inter-client forgetting, we propose a task switching monitor that can automatically identify new entity types under privacy protection and store the latest old global model for knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement of our LGFD model over comparison methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananjan Nandi, Christopher D. Manning, Shikhar Murty</p>
<p>Abstract: While compositional accounts of human language understanding are based on a hierarchical tree-like process, neural models like transformers lack a direct inductive bias for such tree structures. Introducing syntactic inductive biases could unlock more robust and data-efficient learning in transformer language models (LMs), but existing methods for incorporating such structure greatly restrict models, either limiting their expressivity or increasing inference complexity. This work instead aims to softly inject syntactic inductive biases into given transformer circuits, through a structured regularizer. We introduce TreeReg, an auxiliary loss function that converts bracketing decisions from silver parses into a set of differentiable orthogonality constraints on vector hidden states. TreeReg integrates seamlessly with the standard LM objective, requiring no architectural changes. LMs pre-trained with TreeReg on natural language corpora such as WikiText-103 achieve up to 10% lower perplexities on out-of-distribution data and up to 9.5 point improvements in syntactic generalization, requiring less than half the training data to outperform standard LMs. TreeReg still provides gains for pre-trained LLMs: Continued pre-training of Sheared Llama with TreeReg results in improved syntactic generalization, and fine-tuning on MultiNLI with TreeReg mitigates degradation of performance on adversarial NLI benchmarks by 41.2 points. We release all code to guide future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces CLASP (Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining), a multilingual, multimodal representation tailored for audio-text information retrieval. CLASP leverages the synergy between spoken content and textual data. During training, we utilize our newly introduced speech-text dataset, which encompasses 15 diverse categories ranging from fiction to religion. CLASP's audio component integrates audio spectrograms with a pre-trained self-supervised speech model, while its language encoding counterpart employs a sentence encoder pre-trained on over 100 languages. This unified lightweight model bridges the gap between various modalities and languages, enhancing its effectiveness in handling and retrieving multilingual and multimodal data. Our evaluations across multiple languages demonstrate that CLASP establishes new benchmarks in HITS@1, MRR, and meanR metrics, outperforming traditional ASR-based retrieval methods that rely on transcribing speech into text for subsequent text retrieval, especially in specific scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningyu Xu, Qi Zhang, Chao Du, Qiang Luo, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Menghan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: People acquire concepts through rich physical and social experiences and use them to understand the world. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), trained exclusively through next-token prediction over language data, exhibit remarkably human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to humans, and if so, how are such concepts represented and organized? To address these questions, we reframed the classic reverse dictionary task to simulate human concept inference in context and investigated the emergence of human-like conceptual representations within LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can flexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual cues about other concepts. The derived representations converged towards a shared, context-independent structure that effectively predicted human behavior across key psychological phenomena, including computation of similarities, categories and semantic scales. Moreover, these representations aligned well with neural activity patterns in the human brain, even in response to visual rather than linguistic stimuli, providing evidence for biological plausibility. These findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations can naturally emerge from language prediction without real-world grounding. More broadly, our work positions LLMs as promising computational tools for understanding complex human cognition and paves the way for better alignment between artificial and human intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zui Chen, Tianqiao Liu, Mi Tian, Qing Tong, Weiqi Luo, Zitao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), prompting the development of math-specific LLMs such as LLEMMA, DeepSeekMath, and Qwen2-Math, among others. These models typically follow a two-stage training paradigm: pre-training with math-related corpora and post-training with problem datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite these efforts, the improvements in mathematical reasoning achieved through continued pre-training (CPT) are often less significant compared to those obtained via SFT. This study addresses this discrepancy by exploring alternative strategies during the pre-training phase, focusing on the use of problem-solving data over general mathematical corpora. We investigate three primary research questions: (1) Can problem-solving data enhance the model's mathematical reasoning capabilities more effectively than general mathematical corpora during CPT? (2) Are synthetic data from the same source equally effective, and which synthesis methods are most efficient? (3) How do the capabilities developed from the same problem-solving data differ between the CPT and SFT stages, and what factors contribute to these differences? Our findings indicate that problem-solving data significantly enhances the model's mathematical capabilities compared to general mathematical corpora. We also identify effective data synthesis methods, demonstrating that the tutorship amplification synthesis method achieves the best performance. Furthermore, while SFT facilitates instruction-following abilities, it underperforms compared to CPT with the same data, which can be partially attributed to its poor learning capacity for more challenging problem-solving data. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, culminating in our development of a powerful mathematical base model called MathGPT-8B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho, Marta Arias</p>
<p>Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm that hypothesis and find that the best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Yang, Ting Hua, Shangqian Gao, Binfeng Xu, Zheng Tang, Jie Xu, Hongxia Jin, Vijay Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved significant success, their reliance on large volumes of human-annotated data has limited their potential for further scaling. In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwanghee Choi, Eunjung Yeo, Kalvin Chang, Shinji Watanabe, David Mortensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Allophony refers to the variation in the phonetic realization of a phoneme based on its phonetic environment. Modeling allophones is crucial for atypical pronunciation assessment, which involves distinguishing atypical from typical pronunciations. However, recent phoneme classifier-based approaches often simplify this by treating various realizations as a single phoneme, bypassing the complexity of modeling allophonic variation. Motivated by the acoustic modeling capabilities of frozen self-supervised speech model (S3M) features, we propose MixGoP, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian mixture models to model phoneme distributions with multiple subclusters. Our experiments show that MixGoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four out of five datasets, including dysarthric and non-native speech. Our analysis further suggests that S3M features capture allophonic variation more effectively than MFCCs and Mel spectrograms, highlighting the benefits of integrating MixGoP with S3M features.</p>

We investigate the effectiveness of a retrieval-based LLM prompting approach to glossing, applied to the seven languages from the SIGMORPHON 2023 shared task. Our system beats the BERT-based shared task baseline for every language in the morpheme-level score category, and we show that a simple 3-best oracle has higher word-level scores than the challenge winner (a tuned sequence model) in five languages. In a case study on Tsez, we ask the LLM to automatically create and follow linguistic instructions, reducing errors on a confusing grammatical feature. Our results thus demonstrate the potential contributions which LLMs can make in interactive systems for glossing, both in making suggestions to human annotators and following directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Dian Yu, Haitao Mi, Xiangyu Duan, Zhaopeng Tu, Jinsong Su, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in tree search algorithms guided by verifiers have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but at the cost of increased computational resources. In this work, we identify two key challenges contributing to this inefficiency: $\textit{over-exploration}$ due to redundant states with semantically equivalent content, and $\textit{under-exploration}$ caused by high variance in verifier scoring leading to frequent trajectory switching. To address these issues, we propose FETCH, an e$\textbf{f}$fici$\textbf{e}$nt $\textbf{t}$ree sear$\textbf{ch}$ framework, which is a flexible, plug-and-play system compatible with various tree search algorithms. Our framework mitigates over-exploration by merging semantically similar states using agglomerative clustering of text embeddings obtained from a fine-tuned SimCSE model. To tackle under-exploration, we enhance verifiers by incorporating temporal difference learning with adjusted $\lambda$-returns during training to reduce variance, and employing a verifier ensemble to aggregate scores during inference. Experiments on GSM8K, GSM-Plus, and MATH datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly improve reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across four different tree search algorithms, paving the way for more practical applications of LLM-based reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongwu Xu, Xiaojian Li, Shuo Chen, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We release our code to foster further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengwei Teng, Zhaoyang Yu, Quan Shi, Jiayi Zhang, Chenglin Wu, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of independent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially \textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov processes. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\our), where each state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the original problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative \textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful Markov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \our to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of \our both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, \our achieves an \textbf{80.6\%} F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by \textbf{3.4\%} and DeepSeek-R1 by \textbf{10.6\%}.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yongbin Li, Yuchuan Wu, Wentao Ma, Aobo Kong, Fei Huang, Jianbin Jiao, Junge Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumin Jo, Junseong Choi, Jiho Kim, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergey Pletenev, Maria Marina, Daniil Moskovskiy, Vasily Konovalov, Pavel Braslavski, Alexander Panchenko, Mikhail Salnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on many tasks is greatly limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training and stored in the model's parameters. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this study, we investigate how new facts can be incorporated into the LLM using LoRA without compromising the previously learned knowledge. We fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-instruct using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge. Our experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when the training data contains a mixture of known and new facts. However, this approach is still potentially harmful because the model's performance on external question-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the training data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to few overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more confident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases. These findings highlight the potential pitfalls of LoRA-based LLM updates and underscore the importance of training data composition and tuning parameters to balance new knowledge integration and general model capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing landscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The sequential nature of modern LLMs makes them expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution to this problem. Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling. A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs. However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE. We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints. In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test. These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data. Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2. In the SGLang framework, EAGLE-3 achieves a 1.38x throughput improvement at a batch size of 64. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Sijun Zhang, Jian Yang, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zorik Gekhman, Eyal Ben David, Hadas Orgad, Eran Ofek, Yonatan Belinkov, Idan Szpektor, Jonathan Herzig, Roi Reichart</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelyu Ji, Hang Zhang, Yanshan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Question Answering systems based on Retrieval Augmented Generation is promising for clinical decision support because they can integrate external knowledge, thus reducing inaccuracies inherent in standalone large language models (LLMs). However, these systems may unintentionally propagate or amplify biases associated with sensitive demographic attributes like race, gender, and socioeconomic factors. This study systematically evaluates demographic biases within medical RAG pipelines across multiple QA benchmarks, including MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU, and EquityMedQA. We quantify disparities in retrieval consistency and answer correctness by generating and analyzing queries sensitive to demographic variations. We further implement and compare several bias mitigation strategies to address identified biases, including Chain of Thought reasoning, Counterfactual filtering, Adversarial prompt refinement, and Majority Vote aggregation. Experimental results reveal significant demographic disparities, highlighting that Majority Vote aggregation notably improves accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the critical need for explicitly fairness-aware retrieval methods and prompt engineering strategies to develop truly equitable medical QA systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deniss Ruder, Andero Uusberg, Kairit Sirts</p>
<p>Abstract: Appraisal theories suggest that emotions arise from subjective evaluations of events, referred to as appraisals. The taxonomy of appraisals is quite diverse, and they are usually given ratings on a Likert scale to be annotated in an experiencer-annotator or reader-annotator paradigm. This paper studies GPT-4 as a reader-annotator of 21 specific appraisal ratings in different prompt settings, aiming to evaluate and improve its performance compared to human annotators. We found that GPT-4 is an effective reader-annotator that performs close to or even slightly better than human annotators, and its results can be significantly improved by using a majority voting of five completions. GPT-4 also effectively predicts appraisal ratings and emotion labels using a single prompt, but adding instruction complexity results in poorer performance. We also found that longer event descriptions lead to more accurate annotations for both model and human annotator ratings. This work contributes to the growing usage of LLMs in psychology and the strategies for improving GPT-4 performance in annotating appraisals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their transition to real-world applications reveals a critical limitation: the inability to adapt to individual preferences while maintaining alignment with universal human values. Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media, as a means for computer-mediated communication, has been extensively used to study the sentiment expressed by users around events or topics. There is however a gap in the longitudinal study of how sentiment evolved in social media over the years. To fill this gap, we develop TM-Senti, a new large-scale, distantly supervised Twitter sentiment dataset with over 184 million tweets and covering a time period of over seven years. We describe and assess our methodology to put together a large-scale, emoticon- and emoji-based labelled sentiment analysis dataset, along with an analysis of the resulting dataset. Our analysis highlights interesting temporal changes, among others in the increasing use of emojis over emoticons. We publicly release the dataset for further research in tasks including sentiment analysis and text classification of tweets. The dataset can be fully rehydrated including tweet metadata and without missing tweets thanks to the archive of tweets publicly available on the Internet Archive, which the dataset is based on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Kuehn, Mike Schmidt, Markus Bayer, Christian Reuter</p>
<p>Abstract: Publicly available information contains valuable information for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). This can be used to prevent attacks that have already taken place on other systems. Ideally, only the initial attack succeeds and all subsequent ones are detected and stopped. But while there are different standards to exchange this information, a lot of it is shared in articles or blog posts in non-standardized ways. Manually scanning through multiple online portals and news pages to discover new threats and extracting them is a time-consuming task. To automize parts of this scanning process, multiple papers propose extractors that use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from documents. However, while this already solves the problem of extracting the information out of documents, the search for these documents is rarely considered. In this paper, a new focused crawler is proposed called ThreatCrawl, which uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models to classify documents and adapt its crawling path dynamically. While ThreatCrawl has difficulties to classify the specific type of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) named in texts, e.g., IOC content, it can successfully find relevant documents and modify its path accord ingly. It yields harvest rates of up to 52%, which are, to the best of our knowledge, better than the current state of the art. The results and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities exhibited by LLMs and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by employing a set of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending connects borrowers and lenders through online platforms but suffers from significant information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess borrowers' creditworthiness. This paper addresses this challenge by leveraging BERT, a Large Language Model (LLM) known for its ability to capture contextual nuances in text, to generate a risk score based on borrowers' loan descriptions using a dataset from the Lending Club platform. We fine-tune BERT to distinguish between defaulted and non-defaulted loans using the loan descriptions provided by the borrowers. The resulting BERT-generated risk score is then integrated as an additional feature into an XGBoost classifier used at the loan granting stage, where decision-makers have limited information available to guide their decisions. This integration enhances predictive performance, with improvements in balanced accuracy and AUC, highlighting the value of textual features in complementing traditional inputs. Moreover, we find that the incorporation of the BERT score alters how classification models utilize traditional input variables, with these changes varying by loan purpose. These findings suggest that BERT discerns meaningful patterns in loan descriptions, encompassing borrower-specific features, specific purposes, and linguistic characteristics. However, the inherent opacity of LLMs and their potential biases underscore the need for transparent frameworks to ensure regulatory compliance and foster trust. Overall, this study demonstrates how LLM-derived insights interact with traditional features in credit risk modeling, opening new avenues to enhance the explainability and fairness of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Ziming Wei, Jiaqi Chen, Shikui Ma, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Jiang, Weifeng Li, Yuping Qian, Yangjun Zhang, Jianxi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Various ideation methods, such as morphological analysis and design-by-analogy, have been developed to aid creative problem-solving and innovation. Among them, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) stands out as one of the best-known methods. However, the complexity of TRIZ and its reliance on users' knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities limit its practicality. To address this, we introduce AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging LLMs' vast pre-trained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, AutoTRIZ offers a novel, generative, and interpretable approach to engineering innovation. AutoTRIZ takes a problem statement from the user as its initial input, automatically conduct the TRIZ reasoning process and generates a structured solution report. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through comparative experiments with textbook cases and a real-world application in the design of a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS). Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, such as SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of AI-driven innovation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisu Guan, Huanxin Yang, Xinyu Wang, Shengwei Han, Yongge Liu, Lianwen Jin, Xiang Bai, Yuliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Originating from China's Shang Dynasty approximately 3,000 years ago, the Oracle Bone Script (OBS) is a cornerstone in the annals of linguistic history, predating many established writing systems. Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD. Code and decipherment results will be made available at https://github.com/guanhaisu/OBSD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text data is commonly utilized as a primary input to enhance Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) performance and reliability. However, the reliance on human-transcribed text in most studies impedes the development of practical SER systems, creating a gap between in-lab research and real-world scenarios where Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) serves as the text source. Hence, this study benchmarks SER performance using ASR transcripts with varying Word Error Rates (WERs) from eleven models on three well-known corpora: IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, and MSP-Podcast. Our evaluation includes both text-only and bimodal SER with six fusion techniques, aiming for a comprehensive analysis that uncovers novel findings and challenges faced by current SER research. Additionally, we propose a unified ASR error-robust framework integrating ASR error correction and modality-gated fusion, achieving lower WER and higher SER results compared to the best-performing ASR transcript. These findings provide insights into SER with ASR assistance, especially for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding commands. However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding. All the dataset and code are publicly available at: https://gui-world.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehant Kammakomati, Sameer Pimparkhede, Srikanth Tamilselvam, Prince Kumar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work shows Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand natural language constraints for various text generation tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. While, in the code domain, there is wide usage of constraints in code format to maintain the integrity of code written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like JSON and YAML which are widely used for system-level programming tasks in enterprises. Given that LLMs are increasingly used for system-level code tasks, evaluating if they can comprehend these code constraints is crucial. However, no work has been done to evaluate their controllability over code constraints. Hence, we introduce ConCodeEval, a first-of-its-kind benchmark having two novel tasks for code constraints across five representations. Our findings suggest that language models struggle with code constraints. Code languages that perform excellently for normal code tasks do not perform well when the same languages represent fine-grained constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Wang, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Fan Wu, Linke Ouyang, Zhuangcheng Gu, Rui Zhang, Renqiu Xia, Bo Zhang, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Formula recognition presents significant challenges due to the complicated structure and varied notation of mathematical expressions. Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models, the evaluation metrics employed by these models, such as BLEU and Edit Distance, still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data, thereby causing unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end, we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric, ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing an image-level rather than a LaTeX-level metric score. Specifically, CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas, then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching, incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally, we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM, BLEU, and ExpRate metrics. Their results demonstrate that the CDM aligns more closely with human evaluation standards and provides a fairer comparison across different models by eliminating discrepancies caused by diverse formula representations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Huang, Yunfei Long, Cunjin Luo, Sheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning has been explored in making use of label information for multi-label classification, but determining positive samples in multi-label scenario remains challenging. Previous studies have examined strategies for identifying positive samples, considering label overlap proportion between anchors and samples. However, they ignore various relations between given anchors and samples, as well as how to dynamically adjust the weights in contrastive loss functions based on different relations, leading to great ambiguity. In this paper, we introduce five distinct relations between multi-label samples and propose a Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss with contrastive learning for multi-label classification. Our loss function re-weights the loss by computing the similarity and dissimilarity between positive samples and a given anchor based on the introduced relations. We mainly conduct experiments for multi-label text classification on MIMIC datasets, then further extend the evaluation on MS-COCO. The Experimental results show that our proposed loss effectively improves the performance on all encoders under supervised contrastive learning paradigm, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

However, the generated data can deviate from the real-world data, and this misalignment can bring deficient outcomes while applying the trained model to applications. Therefore, we proposed efficient weighted-loss approaches to align synthetic data with real-world distribution by emphasizing high-quality and diversified data generated by LLMs with using merely a little real-world data. We empirically assessed the effectiveness of our method on multiple text classification tasks, and the results showed leveraging our approaches on a BERT-level model robustly outperformed standard cross-entropy and other data weighting approaches, providing potential solutions to effectively leveraging synthetic data from any suitable data generator for model training.</p>

Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves an approximate 2x increase in the pass@k metric compared to baseline models. Furthermore, we introduce two novel evaluation metrics: correctness@k and similarity@k. Our empirical studies indicate that our system attains nearly a 3x improvement in these metrics as well.</p>

Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Luo, Haoning Wu, Dongxu Li, Jing Ma, Mohan Kankanhalli, Junnan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongping Chen, Ruoxi Chen, Shu Pu, Zhaoyi Liu, Yanru Wu, Caixi Chen, Benlin Liu, Yue Huang, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world user queries (e.g. "How do to make egg fried rice?") could benefit from systems capable of generating responses with both textual steps with accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

<p>Abstract: Human label variation (HLV) challenges the standard assumption that a labelled instance has a single ground truth, instead embracing the natural variation in human annotation to train and evaluate models. While various training methods and metrics for HLV have been proposed, it is still unclear which methods and metrics perform best in what settings. We propose new evaluation metrics for HLV leveraging fuzzy set theory. Since these new proposed metrics are differentiable, we then in turn experiment with employing these metrics as training objectives. We conduct an extensive study over 6 HLV datasets testing 14 training methods and 6 evaluation metrics. We find that training on either disaggregated annotations or soft labels performs best across metrics, outperforming training using the proposed training objectives with differentiable metrics. We also show that our proposed soft metric is more interpretable and correlates best with human preference.</p>

We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking, and present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Abdeen Hamed, Alessandro Crimi, Magdalena M. Misiak, Byung Suk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The generative capabilities of LLM models offer opportunities for accelerating tasks but raise concerns about the authenticity of the knowledge they produce. To address these concerns, we present a computational approach that evaluates the factual accuracy of biomedical knowledge generated by an LLM. Our approach consists of two processes: generating disease-centric associations and verifying these associations using the semantic framework of biomedical ontologies. Using ChatGPT as the selected LLM, we designed prompt-engineering processes to establish linkages between diseases and related drugs, symptoms, and genes, and assessed consistency across multiple ChatGPT models (e.g., GPT-turbo, GPT-4, etc.). Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in identifying disease terms (88%-97%), drug names (90%-91%), and genetic information (88%-98%). However, symptom term identification was notably lower (49%-61%), due to the informal and verbose nature of symptom descriptions, which hindered effective semantic matching with the formal language of specialized ontologies. Verification of associations reveals literature coverage rates of 89%-91% for disease-drug and disease-gene pairs, while symptom-related associations exhibit lower coverage (49%-62%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Ren, Zhenwei Dai, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Jingying Zeng, Zhen Li, Rahul Goutam, Suhang Wang, Yue Xing, Qi He, Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning has been proposed to remove copyrighted and privacy-sensitive data from Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on fine-tuning-based methods, which can be categorized into gradient ascent-based (GA-based) and suppression-based methods. However, they often degrade model utility (the ability to respond to normal prompts). In this work, we aim to develop a general framework that enhances the utility of fine-tuning-based unlearning methods. To achieve this goal, we first investigate the common property between GA-based and suppression-based methods. We unveil that GA-based methods unlearn by distinguishing the target data (i.e., the data to be removed) and suppressing related generations, which is essentially the same strategy employed by suppression-based methods. Inspired by this finding, we introduce Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN) which has two components: a soft gate function for distinguishing target data and a suppression module using Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) to adjust representations rather than model parameters. Experiments show that GRUN significantly improves the unlearning and utility. Meanwhile, it is general for fine-tuning-based methods, efficient and promising for sequential unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Mei, Wujiang Xu, Shuhang Lin, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as service endpoints in systems, the surge in query volume creates significant scheduling challenges. Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. For example, those simple queries can be safely handled by small, fast and cheap LLMs, while those complex and difficult queries need to be handled by large, slow, and expensive LLMs. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset for sample-wise response quality and costs collected by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time. The code is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/ECCOS, and the proposed smart routing mechanism has been integrated into AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua D. Reiss</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08823">ResBench: Benchmarking LLM-Generated FPGA Designs with Resource Awareness</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Guo, Tong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains a complex and time-consuming task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM-based code generation primarily focus on functional correctness while overlooking hardware resource usage. Furthermore, current benchmarks offer limited diversity and do not fully represent the wide range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-focused benchmark explicitly designed to distinguish between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL code. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our open-source evaluation framework automatically tests LLMs by generating Verilog code, verifying correctness, and measuring resource usage. The experiments, which primarily analyze Lookup Table (LUT) usage, reveal significant differences among LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's capability to identify models that generate more resource-optimized FPGA designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Coffrini, Mohammad Amin Zadenoori, Paolo Barsocchi, Francesco Furfari, Antonino Crivello, Alessio Ferrari</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor navigation presents unique challenges due to complex layouts, lack of GPS signals, and accessibility concerns. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time adaptability and user-specific needs. In this work, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e., ChatGPT, to generate natural, context-aware navigation instructions from indoor map images. We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 50.54% correct indications and a maximum of 77.78%. The results do not appear to depend on the complexity of the layout or the complexity of the expected path, but rather on the number of points of interest and the abundance of visual information, which negatively affect the performance.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16731">Design and Implementation of an FPGA-Based Tiled Matrix Multiplication Accelerator for Transformer Self-Attention on the Xilinx KV260 SoM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Richie Li, Sicheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on intensive matrix multiplications for attention and feed-forward layers, with the Q, K, and V linear projections in the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) module constituting a decisive performance bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a highly optimized tiled matrix multiplication accelerator on a resource-constrained Xilinx KV260 FPGA that not only addresses this challenge but sets a new standard for efficiency and performance. Our design exploits persistent on-chip storage, a robust two-level tiling strategy for maximal data reuse, and a systolic-like unrolled compute engine that together deliver unparalleled speed and energy efficiency. Integrated with DistilBERT for Q, K, and V projections, our accelerator achieves an unequivocal 7x speedup over ARM CPU implementations (PyTorch) and an extraordinary 200x improvement over naive NumPy, reaching a throughput of up to 3.1~GFLOPs for matrix multiplications on (64,768) x (768,3072) matrices while operating at a conservative 100 MHz. These results decisively demonstrate the transformative potential of FPGA-based acceleration for critical Transformer operations, paving the way for scalable and energy-efficient deep learning inference on edge devices.</p>
