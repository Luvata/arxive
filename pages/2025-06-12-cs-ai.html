<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Cai, Zhenghao Peng, Bolei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40% improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency. Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> C. Opus, A. Lawsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit "accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds. We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Zheng, Jinfeng Zhou, Hongning Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions, we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent modeling and stronger context awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Peng Zou, Wei-Chieh Huang, Yaozu Wu, Chunyu Miao, Dongyuan Li, Aiwei Liu, Yue Zhou, Yankai Chen, Weizhi Zhang, Yangning Li, Liancheng Fang, Renhe Jiang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful partnership.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Yoshua Bengio, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09655">DipLLM: Fine-Tuning LLM for Strategic Decision-making in Diplomacy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Xu, Jiajun Chai, Sicheng Li, Yuqian Fu, Yuanheng Zhu, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zeng, Hengshu Zhu, Chuan Qin, Han Wu, Yihang Cheng, Sirui Zhang, Xiaowei Jin, Yinuo Shen, Zhenxing Wang, Feimin Zhong, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09659">Intent Factored Generation: Unleashing the Diversity in Your Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eltayeb Ahmed, Uljad Berdica, Martha Elliott, Danijela Horak, Jakob N. Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent, e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward. Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into many algorithms for gains across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, Antonio Rago, Maria Vanina Martinez, William Yeoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision operators to better align with human cognitive processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data (robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in the physical world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentyn Boreiko, Alexander Panfilov, Vaclav Voracek, Matthias Hein, Jonas Geiping</p>
<p>Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this, we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Jiaqi Li, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However, it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1% average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3 backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy) across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of 0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alyssa Pinnock, Shakya Jayakody, Kawsher A Roxy, Md Rubel Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abigail Copiaco, Christian Ritz, Yassine Himeur, Valsamma Eapen, Ammar Albanna, Wathiq Mansoor</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has surged rapidly over the past decade, posing significant challenges in communication, behavior, and focus for affected individuals. Current diagnostic techniques, though effective, are time-intensive, leading to high social and economic costs. This work introduces an AI-powered assistive technology designed to streamline ASD diagnosis and management, enhancing convenience for individuals with ASD and efficiency for caregivers and therapists. The system integrates transfer learning with image transforms derived from eye gaze variables to diagnose ASD. This facilitates and opens opportunities for in-home periodical diagnosis, reducing stress for individuals and caregivers, while also preserving user privacy through the use of image transforms. The accessibility of the proposed method also offers opportunities for improved communication between guardians and therapists, ensuring regular updates on progress and evolving support needs. Overall, the approach proposed in this work ensures timely, accessible diagnosis while protecting the subjects' privacy, improving outcomes for individuals with ASD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maoyu Wang, Yao Lu, Jiaqi Nie, Zeyu Wang, Yun Lin, Qi Xuan, Guan Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models, and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN, Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching, allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Xue, Reza Abbasi-Asl, Ramtin Pedarsani</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries, such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries, enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7 $\times$ speedup and 62.9 $\times$ energy savings over mobile Ampere GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilin Li, Jun Yin, Jing Zhong, Ran Luo, Pengyu Zeng, Miao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Chen, Yuanxing Zhang, Yushuo Guan, Bohan Zeng, Yang Shi, Sihan Yang, Pengfei Wan, Qiang Liu, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1 significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and captioning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Chen, Mingxi Zou, Zhuo Wang, Qifan Wang, Dongning Sun, Chi Zhang, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models, demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheda Mai, Arpita Chowdhury, Zihe Wang, Sooyoung Jeon, Lemeng Wang, Jiacheng Hou, Jihyung Kil, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Lin, Partick P. W. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Wang, Liang Wu, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO) plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this, we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards. The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations. This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a 0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Wang, Haoyue Bai, Nanxu Gong, Wangyang Ying, Sixun Dong, Xiquan Cui, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation (error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax, while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search, intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space; (3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy. Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand the original data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Chen, Jiace Zhu, Qi Fan, Yehan Ma, An Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs, with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance, which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific, architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingjie Zhang, Hongkang Li, Changlong Shi, Guowei Rong, He Zhao, Dongsheng Wang, Dandan Guo, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV (Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.</p>

Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyang Zhou, Shunyu Liu, Zengmao Wang, Di Wang, Rong-Cheng Tu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Barron, Devin White</p>
<p>Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization (via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size) succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the design and deployment of small language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources, noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung Hyun Lee, Seungjae Shin, Vinnam Kim, Jaeseong You, An Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models. To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2) that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2 instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Lopez-Piqueres, Pranav Deshpande, Archan Ray, Mattia J. Villani, Marco Pistoia, Niraj Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athena Vakali, Ilias Dimitriadis</p>
<p>Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre), model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end (human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages, under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic, interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical, structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over 59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3 cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Griffin Pitts, Sanaz Motamedi</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James R. Williamson, Andrew Alini, Brian A. Telfer, Adam W. Potter, Karl E. Friedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Holt, Max Ruiz Luyten, Thomas Pouplin, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks, achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations. However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase recall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkang Wu, Devin White, Evelyn Rose, Vernon Lawhern, Nicholas R Waytowich, Yongcan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional RL approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN, showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an encoding mechanism.

<p>Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives: maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently, an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment demonstrates GADC's superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariharan Ramesh, Jyotikrishna Dass</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Hu, Xinqi Wang, Simon Shaolei Du</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent this improvement can be achieved.</p>

  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling display superior robustness across tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Cai, Nayoung Lee, Avi Schwarzschild, Samet Oymak, Dimitris Papailiopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is, training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game chat communication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Alam, Antonio de Domenico, Tareq Si Salem, Florian Kaltenberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment (UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19% throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Steccanella, Joshua B. Evans, \"Ozg\"ur \c{S}im\c{s}ek, Anders Jonsson</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD, accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values, encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of representation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihe Tang, Wenlong Huang, Yingke Wang, Chengshu Li, Roy Yuan, Ruohan Zhang, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadsajad Abavisani, Kseniya Solovyeva, David Danks, Vince Calhoun, Sergey Plis</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling (i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12% improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for higher rates of sub-sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano, David Austin, Pablo Piantanida, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony interpretation dataset introduced in this study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Xiao, Heidi Christensen, Stefan Goetze</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model (LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35% over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of model interpretation and data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshi Wei, Sparks Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond centralized constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Jin Park, Kristjan Greenewald, Kaveh Alim, Hao Wang, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach, performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models (LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B, with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$.

<p>Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09347">ErrorEraser: Unlearning Data Bias for Improved Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemei Cao, Hanlin Gu, Xin Yang, Bingjun Wei, Haoyang Liang, Xiangkun Wang, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks. From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples. Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods.

<p>Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kellie Yu Hui Sim, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Kenny Tsu Wei Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However, variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time, text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions, and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully, experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems. As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts. This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments. Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongguang Zhu, Yunchao Wei, Mengyu Wang, Siyu Jiao, Yan Fang, Jiannan Huang, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives), control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references. Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality learning resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengtian Ma, Yunyue Wei, Chenhui Zuo, Chen Zhang, Yanan Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjie Li, Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and act fast when possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangchen Li, Dimitrios Spatharakis, Saeid Ghafouri, Jiakun Fan, Dimitrios Nikolopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without sacrificing model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jui-Ming Yao, Hao-Yuan Chen, Zi-Xian Tang, Bing-Jia Tan, Sheng-Wei Peng, Bing-Cheng Xie, Shun-Feng Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical or user-facing applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion, synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the internet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukang Feng, Jianwen Sun, Chuanhao Li, Zizhen Li, Jiaxin Ai, Fanrui Zhang, Yifan Chang, Sizhuo Zhou, Shenglin Zhang, Yu Dai, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR) method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs, we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content, image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Ding, Baiqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)' instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Amir, Matteo Bettini, Amanda Prorok</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios, UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhak Yisrael Elboher, Omri Isac, Guy Katz, Tobias Ladner, Haoze Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction techniques within a formal proof framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Liu, Zhenghao Peng, Xuanhao Cui, Bolei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD + MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyi Rong, Haotian Lu, Wenzhuo Zheng, Fan Zhang, Shuangjia Zheng, Ning Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas J. Ringstrom, Paul R. Schrater</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality, modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingheng Wu, Jingze Shi, Yifan Wu, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling. Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms: Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (Unified RoPE) methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this Unified RoPE, we introduce TransXSSM, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a 4K sequence length, TransXSSM exhibits training and inference speeds that are 42.3\% and 29.5\% faster, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling benchmarks.TransXSSM furthermore scales more effectively: TransXSSM-1.3B gains 7.22\% in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\% gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions. To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason da Silva Castanheira, Nicholas Shea, Stephen M. Fleming</p>
<p>Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised) contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals represent their environments in aid of planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beomsik Cho, Jaehyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woojin Cho, Minju Jo, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Wang, Zhenhua Liu, Jiaheng Wei, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taku Okawara, Kenji Koide, Aoki Takanose, Shuji Oishi, Masashi Yokozuka, Kentaro Uno, Kazuya Yoshida</p>
<p>Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wei, Chenhui Qiang, Bowen Jiang, Xumeng Han, Xuehui Yu, Zhenjun Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities. This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion, and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions, including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability, and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of managing more complex real-world knowledge tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itay Nakash, George Kour, Koren Lazar, Matan Vetzler, Guy Uziel, Ateret Anaby-Tavor</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhao Shi, Xiaodan Zhang, Junzhong Ji, Haoning Jiang, Chengxin Zheng, Yinong Wang, Liangqiong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering (73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

<p>Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations -- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xiong, Chuanyuan Tan, Wenliang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs, such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2) Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting (FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well, with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows, expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling. However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average) following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback. Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks, GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step reasoning and belief persistence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability, supporting its potential for practical AD screening.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Collura, Karim Tit, Laura Bussi, Eleonora Giunchiglia, Maxime Cordy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks. However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring, its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240 synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration, and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjong Cheon</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Zhou, Zhiyang Zhang, Jinglong Wang, Xiaobin Li, Jing Zhang, Qian Yu, Lu Sheng, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gusseppe Bravo-Rocca, Peini Liu, Jordi Guitart, Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco, Ajay Dholakia, David Ellison</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps: Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis, and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general. The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Jiang, Min Xie, Jianxi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Jiang, Min Xie, Frank Youhua Chen, Jian Ma, Jianxi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID 4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haruki Kainuma, Takayuki Nishio</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced, while the overall training latency, including both computation and communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.</p>

Despite this highly limited information, experiments on LFW, AgeDB-30, and CFP-FP benchmarks demonstrate that DarkerBB achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracies in the similarity-only setting, with competitive query efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Farronato, Florian Scheidegger, Mattia Rigotti, Cristiano Malossi, Michele Magno, Haotong Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization. We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training, our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over non-calibrated models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Marusov, Alexander Yuhay, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengpeng Li, Zhengyang Tang, Ziniu Li, Mingfeng Xue, Keqin Bao, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun, Benyou Wang, Xiang Wang, Junyang Lin, Dayiheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models.

<p>Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3, and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the work of engineers and the education of future engineers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions, and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect than low-arousal states like concentration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate, non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to dynamic scene reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Gao, Liankai Jin, Xingyu Peng, Jiazhao Zhang, Yue Deng, Annan Li, He Wang, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Kaliosis, John Pavlopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance.

The existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized architectures and future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangning Yu, Zhuohan Wang, Linyi Yang, Haoxuan Li, Anjie Liu, Xiao Xue, Jun Wang, Mengyue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Kallina, Thomas Bohn\'e, Jat Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement (SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to advance rAI development in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3) dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R, VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodion Oblovatny, Alexandra Bazarova, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable solution for hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Chen, Yiran Zhao, Yang Zhang, An Zhang, Kenji Kawaguchi, Shafiq Joty, Junnan Li, Tat-Seng Chua, Michael Qizhe Shieh, Wenxuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However, more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view. In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared (active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families support our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Hickman, Ilija Trajkovic, Julia Kaltenborn, Francis Pelletier, Alex Archibald, Yaniv Gurwicz, Peer Nowack, David Rolnick, Julien Boussard</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhao, Clara Vania, Subhradeep Kayal, Naila Khan, Shay B. Cohen, Emine Yilmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants. However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Federici, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Boris van Breugel, Paul Whatmough, Markus Nagel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Gu, Yuanliang Ju, Shengxiang Sun, Igor Gilitschenski, Haruki Nishimura, Masha Itkina, Florian Shkurti</p>
<p>Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Hu, Rui Ai, Han Zhong, Xiaoyu Chen, Liwei Wang, Zhaoran Wang, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Peng, Yunjia Qi, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Foss, Chloe Evans, Sasha Mitts, Koustuv Sinha, Ammar Rizvi, Justine T. Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering (VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely outcomes of different actions and events through five question types: counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make accurate predictions in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Reichman, Constantin Patsch, Jack Truxal, Atishay Jain, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information. Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of $2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$ interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to prompt injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfei Wu, Jian Guan, Kaituo Feng, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Wei Wu, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhi Wang, Jiaqi Yang, Jianwen Jiang, Chao Liang, Gaojie Lin, Zerong Zheng, Ceyuan Yang, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text, image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However, most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos. Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit counterparts and other existing methods.</p>

To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

<p>Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware, sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled, parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving 91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model (DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas J. Ringstrom, Mohammadhosein Hasanbeig, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of hierarchical planning, compositionality, abstraction, and task transfer are crucial for designing algorithms that can efficiently solve a variety of problems with maximal representational reuse. Many real-world problems require non-Markovian policies to handle complex structured tasks with logical conditions, often leading to prohibitively large state representations; this requires efficient methods for breaking these problems down and reusing structure between tasks. To this end, we introduce a compositional framework called Linearly-Solvable Goal Kernel Dynamic Programming (LS-GKDP) to address the complexity of solving non-Markovian Boolean sub-goal tasks with ordering constraints. LS-GKDP combines the Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) formalism with the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. LMDPs can be efficiently solved as a principal eigenvector problem, and options are policies with termination conditions used as temporally extended actions; with LS-GKDP we expand LMDPs to control over options for logical tasks. This involves decomposing a high-dimensional problem down into a set of goal-condition options for each goal and constructing a goal kernel, which is an abstract transition kernel that jumps from an option's initial-states to its termination-states along with an update of the higher-level task-state. We show how an LMDP with a goal kernel enables the efficient optimization of meta-policies in a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the task grounding. Options can also be remapped to new problems within a super-exponential space of tasks without significant recomputation, and we identify cases where the solution is invariant to the task grounding, permitting zero-shot task transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed M. S. El-Kholany, Martin Gebser, Konstantin Schekotihin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Brindise, Cedric Langbort</p>
<p>Abstract: The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiri Nemecek, Tomas Pevny, Jakub Marecek</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to explain decisions made by AI systems is driven by both recent regulation and user demand. The decisions are often explainable only post hoc. In counterfactual explanations, one may ask what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation. Clearly, multiple criteria must be taken into account, although "distance from the sample" is a key criterion. Recent methods that consider the plausibility of a counterfactual seem to sacrifice this original objective. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations that are, at the same time, close and sparse. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO). We use a Sum-Product Network (SPN) to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual. To achieve that, we propose an MIO formulation of an SPN, which can be of independent interest.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20421">Worse than Random? An Embarrassingly Simple Probing Evaluation of Large Multimodal Models in Medical VQA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Xuehai He, Xiang Yue, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), achieving high accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, their reliability under robust evaluation is questionable. This study reveals that when subjected to simple probing evaluation, state-of-the-art models perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions. To address this critical evaluation problem, we introduce the Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed) dataset to rigorously assess LMM performance in medical imaging through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing original questions with negation questions with hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various diagnostic dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that top-performing models like GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro perform worse than random guessing on specialized diagnostic questions, indicating significant limitations in handling fine-grained medical inquiries. Besides, models like LLaVA-Med struggle even with more general questions, and results from CheXagent demonstrate the transferability of expertise across different modalities of the same organ, showing that specialized domain knowledge is still crucial for improving performance. This study underscores the urgent need for more robust evaluation to ensure the reliability of LMMs in critical fields like medical diagnosis, and current LMMs are still far from applicable to those fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melvin Wong, Jiao Liu, Thiago Rios, Stefan Menzel, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLM-driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm (LLM2TEA), the first agentic AI designer within a generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM) framework that promotes the crossover and synergy of designs from multiple domains, leading to innovative solutions that transcend individual disciplines. Of particular interest is the discovery of objects that are not only innovative but also conform to the physical specifications of the real world in science and engineering. LLM2TEA comprises a large language model to initialize a population of genotypes (defined by text prompts) describing the objects of interest, a text-to-3D generative model to produce phenotypes from these prompts, a classifier to interpret the semantic representations of the objects, and a physics simulation model to assess their physical properties. We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators to guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\% to 174\% improvement in the diversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative model baseline. In addition, more than 73\% of the generated designs have better physical performance than the top 1\% percentile of the designs generated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the proposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible physical objects. The designs produced by LLM2TEA meets practical requirements while showcasing creative and innovative features, underscoring its potential applications in complex design optimization and discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haneul Yoo, Yongjin Yang, Hwaran Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, concerns regarding their safety have become prominent. In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Kharbanda, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Raghava Mutharaju</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-hop query answering over a Knowledge Graph (KG) involves traversing one or more hops from the start node to answer a query. Path-based and logic-based methods are state-of-the-art for multi-hop question answering. The former is used in link prediction tasks. The latter is for answering complex logical queries. The logical multi-hop querying technique embeds the KG and queries in the same embedding space. The existing work incorporates First Order Logic (FOL) operators, such as conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$), and negation ($\neg$), in queries. Though current models have most of the building blocks to execute the FOL queries, they cannot use the dense information of multi-modal entities in the case of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). We propose RConE, an embedding method to capture the multi-modal information needed to answer a query. The model first shortlists candidate (multi-modal) entities containing the answer. It then finds the solution (sub-entities) within those entities. Several existing works tackle path-based question-answering in MMKGs. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to introduce logical constructs in querying MMKGs and to answer queries that involve sub-entities of multi-modal entities as the answer. Extensive evaluation of four publicly available MMKGs indicates that RConE outperforms the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Adam, Tom\'a\v{s} Kliegr</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a method for verifying RDF triples using LLMs, with an emphasis on providing traceable arguments. Because the LLMs cannot currently reliably identify the origin of the information used to construct the response to the user prompt, our approach is to avoid using internal LLM factual knowledge altogether. Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks of external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess the possible application of this retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88 %, and recall is 44 %. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We also evaluated the method on the SNLI dataset, which allowed us to compare our approach with models specifically tuned for the natural language inference task. We demonstrate the method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve statements needing verification. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs could be used for large-scale verification of statements in KGs, a task previously unfeasible due to human annotation costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. In this paper, we introduce preference embedding, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Experimental results show that our General Preference embedding Model (GPM) consistently outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal performance improvements over BT models. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Euler, Pedro Maristany de las Casas, Ralf Bornd\"orfer</p>
<p>Abstract: The logic-constrained shortest path problem (LCSPP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSPP. The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSPP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSPP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the flight planning problem with TFRs as an LCSPP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of dynamic shortest path algorithms, node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Cebrian, Emilia Gomez, David Fernandez Llorca</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation and deployment of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including large language models (LLMs), present unprecedented challenges for AI supervisory entities. We hypothesize that these entities will need to navigate an emergent ecosystem of risk and incident reporting, likely to exceed their supervision capacity. To investigate this, we develop a simulation framework parameterized by features extracted from the diverse landscape of risk, incident, or hazard reporting ecosystems, including community-driven platforms, crowdsourcing initiatives, and expert assessments. We evaluate four supervision policies: non-prioritized (first-come, first-served), random selection, priority-based (addressing the highest-priority risks first), and diversity-prioritized (balancing high-priority risks with comprehensive coverage across risk types). Our results indicate that while priority-based and diversity-prioritized policies are more effective at mitigating high-impact risks, particularly those identified by experts, they may inadvertently neglect systemic issues reported by the broader community. This oversight can create feedback loops that amplify certain types of reporting while discouraging others, leading to a skewed perception of the overall risk landscape. We validate our simulation results with several real-world datasets, including one with over a million ChatGPT interactions, of which more than 150,000 conversations were identified as risky. This validation underscores the complex trade-offs inherent in AI risk supervision and highlights how the choice of risk management policies can shape the future landscape of AI risks across diverse GPAI models used in society.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Doojin Baek, Yoshua Bengio, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Luo, Rui Yang, Hao Sun, Chunyuan Deng, Jiarui Yao, Jingyan Shen, Huan Zhang, Hanjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems. However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/amandaluof/DRMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wang, Xiao Zhang, Mingyi Li, Yuan Yuan, Mengbai Xiao, Fuzhen Zhuang, Dongxiao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of distributed systems, microservices and cloud native technologies have become central to modern enterprise software development. Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruize Zhang, Sirui Xiang, Zelai Xu, Feng Gao, Shilong Ji, Wenhao Tang, Wenbo Ding, Chao Yu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oren Sultan, Eitan Stern, Dafna Shahaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyong Lee, Subo Hwang, Dohoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Lyu, Dandan Zhang, Wei Ye, Fangdi Li, Zhihang Jiang, Yao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is at https://zesen01.github.io/jigsaw-puzzles</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kourosh Shahnazari, Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh, Mohammadali Keshtparvar</p>
<p>Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingnan Zheng, Xiangtian Ji, Yijun Lu, Chenhang Cui, Weixiang Zhao, Gelei Deng, Zhenkai Liang, An Zhang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.</p>

Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Liang Goh, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Jianan Zhou, Mohammed Haroon Dupty, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles. Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen van Bergerem</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Trabucco, Kyle Doherty, Max Gurinas, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Rahimi, Po-Chien Luan, Yuejiang Liu, Frano Raji\v{c}, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show that our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of real-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on the challenges and pathways towards causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Kavner, Lirong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative voting is a natural model of repeated strategic decision-making in social choice theory when agents have the opportunity to update their votes prior to finalizing the group decision. Prior work has analyzed the efficacy of iterative plurality on the welfare of the chosen outcome at equilibrium, relative to the truthful vote profile, via an adaptation of the price of anarchy. However, prior analyses have only studied the worst- and average-case performances when agents' preferences are distributed by the impartial culture. This work extends average-case analysis comprehensively across three alternatives and distinguishes under which of agents' preference distributions iterative plurality improves or degrades asymptotic welfare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemei Gu, Mario Krenn</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth in scientific publications poses a severe challenge for human researchers. It forces attention to more narrow sub-fields, which makes it challenging to discover new impactful research ideas and collaborations outside one's own field. While there are ways to predict a scientific paper's future citation counts, they need the research to be finished and the paper written, usually assessing impact long after the idea was conceived. Here we show how to predict the impact of onsets of ideas that have never been published by researchers. For that, we developed a large evolving knowledge graph built from more than 21 million scientific papers. It combines a semantic network created from the content of the papers and an impact network created from the historic citations of papers. Using machine learning, we can predict the dynamic of the evolving network into the future with high accuracy (AUC values beyond 0.9 for most experiments), and thereby the impact of new research directions. We envision that the ability to predict the impact of new ideas will be a crucial component of future artificial muses that can inspire new impactful and interesting scientific ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Rabiee, Sima Ghafoori, Anna Cetera, Maryam Norouzi, Walter Besio, Reza Abiri</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haneul Yoo, Jieun Han, So-Yeon Ahn, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring with 48.9K samples in total. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%. DREsS will enable further research to provide a more accurate and practical AES system for EFL writing education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansh Singhvi, Diganta Misra, Andrej Erkelens, Raghav Jain, Isabel Papadimitriou, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is an intricately structured system, and a key goal of NLP interpretability is to provide methodological insights for understanding how language models represent this structure internally. In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions measure how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic coarticulation. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases with non-compositional semantics. Our speech results show that inputs are more entangled for pairs where a neighboring consonant is likely to influence a vowel or approximant, showing that models encode the phonetic interaction needed for extracting discrete phonemic representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose "Generative Fusion Decoding" (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework designed to integrate large language models (LLMs) into cross-modal text recognition systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the necessary formulations to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating likelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous progression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play by design, making it readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for any re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through intermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods in English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context learning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware and long-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to 17.7\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Ji, Kaile Wang, Tianyi Qiu, Boyuan Chen, Jiayi Zhou, Changye Li, Hantao Lou, Juntao Dai, Yunhuai Liu, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Jiang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Zhihua Wei, Ziang Xiao, Shu Wang, Xing Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Warning: Contains harmful model outputs. Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite rising global usage of large language models (LLMs), their ability to generate long-form answers to culturally specific questions remains unexplored in many languages. To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of 51.7K culturally specific questions across 23 different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like "Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?" (Kirundi; English translation: "Why was the first king of Burundi called Ntare (Lion)?"). We evaluate factuality, relevance and surface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for many languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g., answering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource languages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more factual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions -- questions that have consistent meaning and answer across many cultures. We release CaLMQA to facilitate future research in cultural and multilingual long-form QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Song, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page: https://t-ys.github.io/BiCo-Fusion/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedang Lad, Wes Gurnee, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Erfan Sadeghi, Arash Fayyazi, Suhas Somashekar, Armin Abdollahi, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine learning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humor, deeply rooted in societal meanings and cultural details, poses a unique challenge for machines. While advances have been made in natural language processing, real-world humor often thrives in a multi-modal context, encapsulated distinctively by memes. This paper poses a particular emphasis on the impact of multi-images on meme captioning. After that, we introduce the \textsc{XMeCap} framework, a novel approach that adopts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning based on an innovative reward model, which factors in both global and local similarities between visuals and text. Our results, benchmarked against contemporary models, manifest a marked improvement in caption generation for both single-image and multi-image memes, as well as different meme categories. \textsc{XMeCap} achieves an average evaluation score of 75.85 for single-image memes and 66.32 for multi-image memes, outperforming the best baseline by 6.75\% and 8.56\%, respectively. This research not only establishes a new frontier in meme-related studies but also underscores the potential of machines in understanding and generating humor in a multi-modal setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Huang, Jiayang Song, Qiang Hu, Felix Juefei-Xu, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance evaluation plays a crucial role in the development life cycle of large language models (LLMs). It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a more accurate performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimation is a critical challenge in open-set recognition, where a probe biometric sample may belong to an unknown identity. It can be addressed through sample quality estimation via probabilistic embeddings. However, the low variance of probabilistic embedding only partly implies a low identification error probability: an embedding of a sample could be close to several classes in a gallery, thus yielding high uncertainty despite high sample quality. We propose HolUE - a holistic uncertainty estimation method based on a Bayesian probabilistic model; it is aware of two sources of ambiguity in the open-set recognition system: (1) the gallery uncertainty caused by overlapping classes and (2) the uncertainty of embeddings. Challenging open-set recognition datasets, such as IJB-C for the image domain and VoxBlink for the audio domain, serve as a testbed for our method. We also provide a new open-set recognition protocol for the identification of whales and dolphins. In all cases, HolUE better identifies recognition errors than alternative uncertainty estimation methods, including those based solely on sample quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical.In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Salatino, Tanay Aggarwal, Andrea Mannocci, Francesco Osborne, Enrico Motta</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arshiya Khan, Guannan Liu, Xing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant challenges in detecting and repairing vulnerable code, particularly when dealing with vulnerabilities involving multiple aspects, such as variables, code flows, and code structures. In this study, we utilize GitHub Copilot as the LLM and focus on buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal a notable gap in Copilot's abilities when dealing with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, with a 76% vulnerability detection rate but only a 15% vulnerability repair rate. To address this issue, we propose context-aware prompt tuning techniques designed to enhance LLM performance in repairing buffer overflow. By injecting a sequence of domain knowledge about the vulnerability, including various security and code contexts, we demonstrate that Copilot's successful repair rate increases to 63%, representing more than four times the improvement compared to repairs without domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Liu, Zhixin Lai, Jiawen Wang, Gengyuan Zhang, Shuo Chen, Philip Torr, Vera Demberg, Volker Tresp, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable advancements in terms of image quality and fidelity to textual prompts. Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10\% to 70\% where DALLE 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data. Our work provides a foundation for further development towards more secure and reliable T2I models. Project page at https://multimodalpragmatic.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco N. F. Q. Simoes, Mehdi Dastani, Thijs van Ommen</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Ochieng, Dennis Kaburu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuying Wang, Feng Wu, Yihan Tang, Lequan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haneul Yoo, Cheonbok Park, Sangdoo Yun, Alice Oh, Hwaran Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in various tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of high-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching$\unicode{x2014}$the practice of language alternation in a conversation$\unicode{x2014}$we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavel Sulimov, Claude Lehmann, Kurt Stockinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Query optimization has become a research area where classical algorithms are being challenged by machine learning algorithms. At the same time, recent trends in learned query optimizers have shown that it is prudent to take advantage of decades of database research and augment classical query optimizers by shrinking the plan search space through different types of hints (e.g. by specifying the join type, scan type or the order of joins) rather than completely replacing the classical query optimizer with machine learning models. It is especially relevant for cases when classical optimizers cannot fully enumerate all logical and physical plans and, as an alternative, need to rely on less robust approaches like genetic algorithms. However, even symbiotically learned query optimizers are hampered by the need for vast amounts of training data, slow plan generation during inference and unstable results across various workload conditions. In this paper, we present GenJoin - a novel learned query optimizer that considers the query optimization problem as a generative task and is capable of learning from a random set of subplan hints to produce query plans that outperform the classical optimizer. GenJoin is the first learned query optimizer that significantly and consistently outperforms PostgreSQL as well as state-of-the-art methods on two well-known real-world benchmarks across a variety of workloads using rigorous machine learning evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nay Myat Min, Long H. Pham, Yige Li, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that manipulate outputs via hidden triggers. Existing defense methods--designed for vision/text classification tasks--fail for text generation. We propose Internal Consistency Regularization (CROW), a defense leveraging the observation that backdoored models exhibit unstable layer-wise hidden representations when triggered, while clean models show smooth transitions. CROW enforces consistency across layers via adversarial perturbations and regularization during finetuning, neutralizing backdoors without requiring clean reference models or trigger knowledge--only a small clean dataset. Experiments across Llama-2 (7B, 13B), CodeLlama (7B, 13B), and Mistral-7B demonstrate CROW's effectiveness: it achieves significant reductions in attack success rates across diverse backdoor strategies (sentiment steering, targeted refusal, code injection) while preserving generative performance. CROW's architecture-agnostic design enables practical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milena Chadimov\'a, Eduard Jur\'a\v{s}ek, Tom\'a\v{s} Kliegr</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method, referred to as "hashing", which involves masking potentially bias-inducing words in large language models (LLMs) with hash-like meaningless identifiers to reduce cognitive biases and reliance on external knowledge. The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Ningyuan Xi, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Yue Zhao, Xiaokai Chen, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanay Aggarwal, Angelo Salatino, Francesco Osborne, Enrico Motta</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Tian, Xingshuo Han, Guoquan Wu, An Guo, Yuan Zhou. Jie Zhang, Shuo Li, Jun Wei, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Lyu, Zijing Tian, Zhonghong Ou, Yifan Zhu, Xiao Zhang, Qiankun Ha, Haoran Luo, Meina Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval maps data under different modality via semantic relevance. Existing approaches implicitly assume that data pairs are well-aligned and ignore the widely existing annotation noise, i.e., noisy correspondence (NC). Consequently, it inevitably causes performance degradation. Despite attempts that employ the co-teaching paradigm with identical architectures to provide distinct data perspectives, the differences between these architectures are primarily stemmed from random initialization. Thus, the model becomes increasingly homogeneous along with the training process. Consequently, the additional information brought by this paradigm is severely limited. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a Tripartite learning with Semantic Variation Consistency (TSVC) for robust image-text retrieval. We design a tripartite cooperative learning mechanism comprising a Coordinator, a Master, and an Assistant model. The Coordinator distributes data, and the Assistant model supports the Master model's noisy label prediction with diverse data. Moreover, we introduce a soft label estimation method based on mutual information variation, which quantifies the noise in new samples and assigns corresponding soft labels. We also present a new loss function to enhance robustness and optimize training effectiveness. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, even at increasing noise ratios, TSVC exhibits significant advantages in retrieval accuracy and maintains stable training performance.</p>

Based on our findings and in-depth analysis, we identify several promising directions for future research aimed at enhancing LLMs' zero-shot capabilities in irony detection, reasoning, and comprehension. These include advancing contextual awareness in irony detection, exploring hybrid symbolic-neural methods, and integrating multimodal data, among others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bias evaluation is fundamental to trustworthy AI, both in terms of checking data quality and in terms of checking the outputs of AI systems. In testing data quality, for example, one may study the distance of a given dataset, viewed as a distribution, to a given ground-truth reference dataset. However, classical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances, are known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide a meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD). In this metric, two distributions are close if, roughly, discrepancies are low for all feature subgroups. While the number of subgroups may be exponential, we show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of features, thus making it feasible for practical applications. Moreover, we provide a practical algorithm for evaluating the distance based on Mixed-integer optimization (MIO). We also note that the proposed distance is easily interpretable, thus providing clearer paths to fixing the biases once they have been identified. Finally, we describe a natural general bias detection framework, termed MSDD distances, and show that MSD aligns well with this framework. We empirically evaluate MSD by comparing it with other metrics and by demonstrating the above properties of MSD on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Li, Yuheng Tang, Shiqi Wang, Wenbo Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and rule-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Rule-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel rule-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/PatchPilot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hepeng Li, Yuhong Liu, Jun Yan, Jie Gao, Xiaoou Yang, Mohamed Naili</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijie Zhu, Xianjun Yang, Jindong Wang, Wenbo Guo, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Gaurav Jain, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms demonstrate significant speedups of up to 2.8x over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as a drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.</p>

<p>Abstract: The capabilities of artificial intelligence systems have been advancing to a great extent, but these systems still struggle with failure modes, vulnerabilities, and biases. In this paper, we study the current state of the field, and present promising insights and perspectives regarding concerns that challenge the trustworthiness of AI models. In particular, this paper investigates the issues regarding three thrusts: safety, privacy, and bias, which hurt models' trustworthiness. For safety, we discuss safety alignment in the context of large language models, preventing them from generating toxic or harmful content. For bias, we focus on spurious biases that can mislead a network. Lastly, for privacy, we cover membership inference attacks in deep neural networks. The discussions addressed in this paper reflect our own experiments and observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Guan, Abhijith Sharma, Chong Tian, Salem Lahlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

<p>Abstract: As machine learning-based prediction systems are increasingly used in high-stakes situations, it is important to understand how such predictive models will perform upon deployment. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques such as conformal prediction provide guarantees about the loss black-box models will incur even when the details of the models are hidden. However, such methods are based on frequentist probability, which unduly limits their applicability. We revisit the central aspects of conformal prediction from a Bayesian perspective and thereby illuminate the shortcomings of frequentist guarantees. We propose a practical alternative based on Bayesian quadrature that provides interpretable guarantees and offers a richer representation of the likely range of losses to be observed at test time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Kibum Kim, Jiwan Kim, Donghyun Kim, Minchul Yang, Kwangjin Oh, Julian McAuley, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made them powerful tools in embodied navigation, enabling agents to leverage commonsense and spatial reasoning for efficient exploration in unfamiliar environments. Existing LLM-based approaches convert global memory, such as semantic or topological maps, into language descriptions to guide navigation. While this improves efficiency and reduces redundant exploration, the loss of geometric information in language-based representations hinders spatial reasoning, especially in intricate environments. To address this, VLM-based approaches directly process ego-centric visual inputs to select optimal directions for exploration. However, relying solely on a first-person perspective makes navigation a partially observed decision-making problem, leading to suboptimal decisions in complex environments. In this paper, we present a novel vision-language model (VLM)-based navigation framework that addresses these challenges by adaptively retrieving task-relevant cues from a global memory module and integrating them with the agent's egocentric observations. By dynamically aligning global contextual information with local perception, our approach enhances spatial reasoning and decision-making in long-horizon tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in object navigation tasks, providing a more effective and scalable solution for embodied navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Yue Fan, Hongquan Li, Shan Jiang, Yang Zhao, Xinze Guan, Ching-Chen Kuo, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh Mehta, Guy M McKhann, Daniel Friedman, Adeen Flinker, Nima Mesgarani</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<p>Abstract: Self-consistency improves reasoning by aggregating diverse stochastic samples, yet the dynamics behind its efficacy remain underexplored. We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules. This establishes self-consistency as a synchronization challenge between sampling dynamics and evolving answer distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Zhang, Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Jihui Guo, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Zhe Zheng, Linjuan Wu, Wenqi Zhang, Yuchen Yan, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and diversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and efficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and selective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across different model architectures and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o with substantially fewer computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Revolutionizing drug discovery demands more than just understanding molecular interactions - it requires generative models that can design novel ligands tailored to specific biological targets. While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Yang, Shilin Lu, Shizheng Wang, Meng Hwa Er, Zengwei Zheng, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</p>

Although these traces effectively facilitate knowledge distillation into smaller, instruction-tuned models, the precise nature of transferred reasoning remains unclear. In this study, we investigate to what extent distilled models internalize replicated stylistic patterns during reasoning. To this end, we systematically analyze reasoning traces, identifying structural and lexical patterns that characterize successful reasoning. We then introduce two new datasets -- a dataset of emergent reasoning traces and a synthetic dataset explicitly constructed to replicate these stylistic patterns -- to precisely examine their influence on distilled models' reasoning capabilities. We find that models trained on the synthetic traces achieve comparable performance, indicating that distilled reasoning abilities rely significantly on surface-level patterns. Surprisingly, we observe an increase in performance even when the synthetic traces are altered to lead to the wrong answer. Our findings highlight how stylistic patterns can be leveraged to efficiently enhance LM reasoning across diverse model families.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are fundamental in artificial intelligence, driving progress in computer vision and natural language processing. High-quality datasets are crucial for their development, and there is growing interest in datasets composed of neural networks themselves to support benchmarking, automated machine learning (AutoML), and model analysis. We introduce LEMUR, an open source dataset of neural network models with well-structured code for diverse architectures across tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, and natural language processing. LEMUR is primarily designed to provide a rich source of structured model representations and associated performance data, enabling the fine-tuning of large language models for AutoML applications. Leveraging Python and PyTorch, LEMUR enables seamless extension to new datasets and models while maintaining consistency. It integrates an Optuna-powered framework for evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, statistical analysis, and graphical insights. LEMUR VR extension enables the seamless deployment of models in virtual reality, optimizing their performance on resource-constrained devices. Providing tools for model evaluation, preprocessing, and database management, LEMUR supports researchers and practitioners in developing, testing, and analyzing neural networks. It offers an API that delivers comprehensive information about neural network models and their complete performance statistics with a single request, which can be used in experiments with code-generating large language models. The LEMUR and its plugins are accessible as open source projects under the MIT license at https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset, https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-plots and https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-vr.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential as underlying tools to support learning and teaching in a variety of ways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotian Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Yang Feng, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment, paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment. Our code is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviv Bick, Eric Xing, Albert Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences, but their fixed-size recurrent state limits capability on algorithmic tasks, such as retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models and find that both rely on a similar Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism: a Gather Head extracts relevant information pieces from context, which an Aggregate Head integrates into a single representation. In both architectures, G&A concentrates in a few heads, forming critical bottlenecks even for simple retrieval. For example, we show that disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25% (random guessing). Moreover, this retrieval bottleneck can obscure limited knowledge demands of tasks as the pruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&A heads yet fails on other knowledge benchmarks. The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs typically underperform, such as GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue comprehension. We show that SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother attention patterns instead of the sharp token transitions effective G&A requires. Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads, rather than the entire language model. This suggests a unified explanation for Transformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths. We find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with a few attention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention. Similarly, replacing a single G&A head in a pretrained SSM with an attention variant boosts retrieval and benchmark scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongwook Han, Dongmin Choi, Woojung Song, Eun-Ju Lee, Yohan Jo</p>
<p>Abstract: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Yue Zhao, Qingqing Gu, Zhonglin Jiang, Xiaokai Chen, Yong Chen, Luo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency, reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a Nvidia 4090 GPU).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Wenxuan Huang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning. However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets and models validate the proposed module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egil Diau</p>
<p>Abstract: Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningyuan Yang, Jiaxuan Gao, Feng Gao, Yi Wu, Chao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Zhenhong Zhou, Kun Wang, Junfeng Fang, Yuanhe Zhang, Rui Wang, Ge Zhang, Xavier Li, Li Sun, Lingjuan Lyu, Yang Liu, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.</p>

<p>Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, Iterated Prefill Crawler (IPC), that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark IPC on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawler to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, IPC elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis B\'ethune, David Vigouroux, Yilun Du, Rufin VanRullen, Thomas Serre, Victor Boutin</p>
<p>Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomiao Qiu, Miao Zhang, Ziyue Qiao, Weili Guan, Min Zhang, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwoo Lee, Dong Bok Lee, Steven Adriaensen, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang, Frank Hutter, Seon Joo Kim, Hae Beom Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhuo Li, Bo Wang, Xiuze Zhou, Peijie Jiang, Jia Liu, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qichao Wang, Ziqiao Meng, Wenqian Cui, Yifei Zhang, Pengcheng Wu, Bingzhe Wu, Irwin King, Liang Chen, Peilin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Xiao, Junnan Dong, Chuang Zhou, Su Dong, Qian-wen Zhang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngwan Lee, Kangsan Kim, Kwanyong Park, Ilcahe Jung, Soojin Jang, Seanie Lee, Yong-Ju Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Pan, Mary-Anne Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant way of judging Large Language Models (LLMs) has been to ask how well they can recall explicit facts from very long inputs. While today's best models achieve near perfect recall, this masks a harder skill: performing multi-step reasoning and tracking intermediate state that never appears verbatim. We introduce Verbose ListOps (VLO), a benchmark that embeds deterministic ListOps computations inside narrative camouflage and, crucially, allows step-level evaluation of every intermediate result. Experiments show that models which solve raw ListOps with approximately 100% accuracy collapse on VLO after only 10,000 tokens. By exposing where a model's reasoning chain first diverges, VLO moves assessment beyond sheer context length and toward genuine comprehension. VLO's generation pipeline is task-agnostic: it can weave any deterministically verifiable reasoning schema -- arithmetic, symbolic, abductive, inductive or defeasible -- into narrative form. This makes VLO a reusable test-bed for the next wave of reasoning-centric model designs, not merely those with step-explicit scaffolds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaydip Sen, Saptarshi Sengupta, Subhasis Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS) algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation. To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS) is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardis Nadimi, Payam Abdisarabshali, Kasra Borazjani, Jacob Chakareski, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Pierron, Michel Barbeau, Luca De Cicco, Jose Rubio-Hernan, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyuan Zhu, Yaowen Ye, Tianyi Qiu, Hanlin Zhu, Sijun Tan, Ajraf Mannan, Jonathan Michala, Raluca Ada Popa, Willie Neiswanger</p>
<p>Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs), users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under constrained query budgets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p>

We also provide practical guidelines for scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an advance that deepens our understanding of in-context learning in LLMs and establishes its potential as a powerful tool for uncovering hidden structure in complex scientific data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ken Yaggel, Eyal German, Aviel Ben Siman Tov</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20) but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy in complex environments.

<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions. Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silin Gao, Antoine Bosselut, Samy Bengio, Emmanuel Abbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhen Li, Dell Zhang, Xuelong Li, Yiqing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text, enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Jiang, Amil Dravid, Alexei Efros, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Liu, Tianyi Xiong, Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, Junfeng Guo, Tianyi Zhou, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Han, Jun Zhou, Jialun Pei, Jing Qin, Yingfang Fan, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei Lyu, Weijia Zhang, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter temperature compared to previous best models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Wang, Hao Peng, Senzhang Wang, Haohua Du, Chunyang Liu, Jia Wu, Guanlin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/STAMImupter.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chupei Wang (University of Virginia), Jiaqiu Vince Sun (New York University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Tieu, Dongqi Fu, Zihao Li, Ross Maciejewski, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Changjiang, Liang Jiacheng, Cao Bochuan, Chen Jinghui, Wang Ting</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiya Li, Junjie Chen, Bei Li, Boyang Liu, Zichen Wen, Nuanqiao Shan, Xiaoqian Liu, Anping Liu, Huajie Liu, Hu Song, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dieuwertje Alblas, Patryk Rygiel, Julian Suk, Kaj O. Kappe, Marieke Hofman, Christoph Brune, Kak Khee Yeung, Jelmer M. Wolterink</p>
<p>Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dror Kris Markus, Fabrizio Gilardi, Daria Stetsenko</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice. This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between 2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output. These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samah Kansab, Francis Bordeleau, Ali Tizghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes (e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clara Lachenmaier, Judith Sieker, Sina Zarrie{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse.</p>
