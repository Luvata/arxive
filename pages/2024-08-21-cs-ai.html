<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangxi Wu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in the field of code generation. However, as more and more users rely on these models for software development, the security risks associated with code generation models have become increasingly significant. Studies have shown that traditional deep learning robustness issues also negatively impact the field of code generation. In this paper, we first present the game-theoretic model that focuses on security issues in code generation scenarios. This framework outlines possible scenarios and patterns where attackers could spread malicious code models to create security threats. We also pointed out for the first time that the attackers can use backdoor attacks to dynamically adjust the timing of malicious code injection, which will release varying degrees of malicious code depending on the skill level of the user. Through extensive experiments on leading code generation models, we validate our proposed game-theoretic model and highlight the significant threats that these new attack scenarios pose to the safe use of code models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10343">LegalBench-RAG: A Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Legal Domain</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Pipitone, Ghita Houir Alami</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are showing promising potential, and are becoming increasingly relevant in AI-powered legal applications. Existing benchmarks, such as LegalBench, assess the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain, but there is a critical gap in evaluating the retrieval component of RAG systems. To address this, we introduce LegalBench-RAG, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the retrieval step of RAG pipelines within the legal space. LegalBench-RAG emphasizes precise retrieval by focusing on extracting minimal, highly relevant text segments from legal documents. These highly relevant snippets are preferred over retrieving document IDs, or large sequences of imprecise chunks, both of which can exceed context window limitations. Long context windows cost more to process, induce higher latency, and lead LLMs to forget or hallucinate information. Additionally, precise results allow LLMs to generate citations for the end user. The LegalBench-RAG benchmark is constructed by retracing the context used in LegalBench queries back to their original locations within the legal corpus, resulting in a dataset of 6,858 query-answer pairs over a corpus of over 79M characters, entirely human-annotated by legal experts. We also introduce LegalBench-RAG-mini, a lightweight version for rapid iteration and experimentation. By providing a dedicated benchmark for legal retrieval, LegalBench-RAG serves as a critical tool for companies and researchers focused on enhancing the accuracy and performance of RAG systems in the legal domain. The LegalBench-RAG dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/zeroentropy-cc/legalbenchrag.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Grohe, Christoph Standke, Juno Steegmans, Jan Van den Bussche</p>
<p>Abstract: We lay the foundations for a database-inspired approach to interpreting and understanding neural network models by querying them using declarative languages. Towards this end we study different query languages, based on first-order logic, that mainly differ in their access to the neural network model. First-order logic over the reals naturally yields a language which views the network as a black box; only the input--output function defined by the network can be queried. This is essentially the approach of constraint query languages. On the other hand, a white-box language can be obtained by viewing the network as a weighted graph, and extending first-order logic with summation over weight terms. The latter approach is essentially an abstraction of SQL. In general, the two approaches are incomparable in expressive power, as we will show. Under natural circumstances, however, the white-box approach can subsume the black-box approach; this is our main result. We prove the result concretely for linear constraint queries over real functions definable by feedforward neural networks with a fixed number of hidden layers and piecewise linear activation functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keith Tyser, Ben Segev, Gaston Longhitano, Xin-Yu Zhang, Zachary Meeks, Jason Lee, Uday Garg, Nicholas Belsten, Avi Shporer, Madeleine Udell, Dov Te'eni, Iddo Drori</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic reviewing helps handle a large volume of papers, provides early feedback and quality control, reduces bias, and allows the analysis of trends. We evaluate the alignment of automatic paper reviews with human reviews using an arena of human preferences by pairwise comparisons. Gathering human preference may be time-consuming; therefore, we also use an LLM to automatically evaluate reviews to increase sample efficiency while reducing bias. In addition to evaluating human and LLM preferences among LLM reviews, we fine-tune an LLM to predict human preferences, predicting which reviews humans will prefer in a head-to-head battle between LLMs. We artificially introduce errors into papers and analyze the LLM's responses to identify limitations, use adaptive review questions, meta prompting, role-playing, integrate visual and textual analysis, use venue-specific reviewing materials, and predict human preferences, improving upon the limitations of the traditional review processes. We make the reviews of publicly available arXiv and open-access Nature journal papers available online, along with a free service which helps authors review and revise their research papers and improve their quality. This work develops proof-of-concept LLM reviewing systems that quickly deliver consistent, high-quality reviews and evaluate their quality. We mitigate the risks of misuse, inflated review scores, overconfident ratings, and skewed score distributions by augmenting the LLM with multiple documents, including the review form, reviewer guide, code of ethics and conduct, area chair guidelines, and previous year statistics, by finding which errors and shortcomings of the paper may be detected by automated reviews, and evaluating pairwise reviewer preferences. This work identifies and addresses the limitations of using LLMs as reviewers and evaluators and enhances the quality of the reviewing process.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates work on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) anti-bullying system. The system is designed to identify coordinated bullying attacks via social media and other mechanisms, characterize them and propose remediation and response activities to them. In particular, a large language model (LLM) is used to populate an enhanced expert system-based network model of a bullying attack. This facilitates analysis and remediation activity - such as generating report messages to social media companies - determination. The system is described and the efficacy of the LLM for populating the model is analyzed herein.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10442">Feasibility of assessing cognitive impairment via distributed camera network and privacy-preserving edge computing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaitra Hegde, Yashar Kiarashi, Allan I Levey, Amy D Rodriguez, Hyeokhyen Kwon, Gari D Clifford</p>
<p>Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a decline in cognitive functions beyond typical age and education-related expectations. Since, MCI has been linked to reduced social interactions and increased aimless movements, we aimed to automate the capture of these behaviors to enhance longitudinal monitoring.
  METHODS: Using a privacy-preserving distributed camera network, we collected movement and social interaction data from groups of individuals with MCI undergoing therapy within a 1700$m^2$ space. We developed movement and social interaction features, which were then used to train a series of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between higher and lower cognitive functioning MCI groups.
  RESULTS: A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between high and low-functioning cohorts in features such as linear path length, walking speed, change in direction while walking, entropy of velocity and direction change, and number of group formations in the indoor space. Despite lacking individual identifiers to associate with specific levels of MCI, a machine learning approach using the most significant features provided a 71% accuracy.
  DISCUSSION: We provide evidence to show that a privacy-preserving low-cost camera network using edge computing framework has the potential to distinguish between different levels of cognitive impairment from the movements and social interactions captured during group activities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10455">IDEA: Enhancing the rule learning ability of language agent through Induction, DEuction, and Abduction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu He, Zhiyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. This work introduces RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning ability of LLMs in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents interact with the environment to gather observations and discern patterns, using these insights to solve problems. To further enhance the rule-learning capabilities of LLM agents within this benchmark, we propose IDEA agent, which integrates Induction, Deduction, and Abduction processes. IDEA agent refines this approach by leveraging a structured reasoning sequence: generating hypotheses through abduction, testing them via deduction, and refining them based on induction feedback. This sequence enables agents to dynamically establish and apply rules, mimicking human-like reasoning processes. Our evaluation of five representative LLMs indicates that while these models can generate plausible initial hypotheses, they often struggle with strategic interaction within the environment, effective incorporation of feedback, and adaptive refinement of their hypotheses. IDEA agent demonstrates significantly improved performance on the RULEARN benchmark, offering valuable insights for the development of agents capable of human-like rule-learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan An, Samarth Kolanupaka, Jacob An, Matthew Ma, Unnat Chhatwal, Alex Kalinowski, Michelle Rogers, Brian Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent lecturing assistant (ILA) system that utilizes a knowledge graph to represent course content and optimal pedagogical strategies. The system is designed to support instructors in enhancing student learning through real-time analysis of voice, content, and teaching methods. As an initial investigation, we present a case study on lecture voice sentiment analysis, in which we developed a training set comprising over 3,000 one-minute lecture voice clips. Each clip was manually labeled as either engaging or non-engaging. Utilizing this dataset, we constructed and evaluated several classification models based on a variety of features extracted from the voice clips. The results demonstrate promising performance, achieving an F1-score of 90% for boring lectures on an independent set of over 800 test voice clips. This case study lays the groundwork for the development of a more sophisticated model that will integrate content analysis and pedagogical practices. Our ultimate goal is to aid instructors in teaching more engagingly and effectively by leveraging modern artificial intelligence techniques.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10504">QPO: Query-dependent Prompt Optimization via Multi-Loop Offline Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Kong, Hangyu Mao, Qi Zhao, Bin Zhang, Jingqing Ruan, Li Shen, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang, Rui Zhao, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10512">Approximate Estimation of High-dimension Execution Skill for Dynamic Agents in Continuous Domains</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Delma Nieves-Rivera, Christopher Archibald</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world continuous action domains, human agents must decide which actions to attempt and then execute those actions to the best of their ability. However, humans cannot execute actions without error. Human performance in these domains can potentially be improved by the use of AI to aid in decision-making. One requirement for an AI to correctly reason about what actions a human agent should attempt is a correct model of that human's execution error, or skill. Recent work has demonstrated successful techniques for estimating this execution error with various types of agents across different domains. However, this previous work made several assumptions that limit the application of these ideas to real-world settings. First, previous work assumed that the error distributions were symmetric normal, which meant that only a single parameter had to be estimated. In reality, agent error distributions might exhibit arbitrary shapes and should be modeled more flexibly. Second, it was assumed that the execution error of the agent remained constant across all observations. Especially for human agents, execution error changes over time, and this must be taken into account to obtain effective estimates. To overcome both of these shortcomings, we propose a novel particle-filter-based estimator for this problem. After describing the details of this approximate estimator, we experimentally explore various design decisions and compare performance with previous skill estimators in a variety of settings to showcase the improvements. The outcome is an estimator capable of generating more realistic, time-varying execution skill estimates of agents, which can then be used to assist agents in making better decisions and improve their overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of traditional IVR (Interactive Voice Response) methods often proves insufficient to meet customer needs. This article examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance the efficiency of IVR systems in call centers. A proposed approach is based on the integration of speech-to-text conversion solutions, text query classification using large language models (LLM), and speech synthesis. Special attention is given to adapting these technologies to work with the Kazakh language, including fine-tuning models on specialized datasets. The practical aspects of implementing the developed system in a real call center for query classification are described. The research results demonstrate that the application of AI technologies in call center IVR systems reduces operator workload, improves customer service quality, and increases the efficiency of query processing. The proposed approach can be adapted for use in call centers operating with various languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) critically depends on the availability of high-quality, pre-collected offline datasets that represent real-world complexities and practical applications. However, existing datasets often fall short in their simplicity and lack of realism. To address this gap, we propose Hokoff, a comprehensive set of pre-collected datasets that covers both offline RL and offline MARL, accompanied by a robust framework, to facilitate further research. This data is derived from Honor of Kings, a recognized Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game known for its intricate nature, closely resembling real-life situations. Utilizing this framework, we benchmark a variety of offline RL and offline MARL algorithms. We also introduce a novel baseline algorithm tailored for the inherent hierarchical action space of the game. We reveal the incompetency of current offline RL approaches in handling task complexity, generalization and multi-task learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Litian Huang, Xinguo Yu, Feng Xiong, Bin He, Shengbing Tang, Jiawen Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving Algebra Problems with Geometry Diagrams (APGDs) is still a challenging problem because diagram processing is not studied as intensively as language processing. To work against this challenge, this paper proposes a hologram reasoning scheme and develops a high-performance method for solving APGDs by using this scheme. To reach this goal, it first defines a hologram, being a kind of graph, and proposes a hologram generator to convert a given APGD into a hologram, which represents the entire information of APGD and the relations for solving the problem can be acquired from it by a uniform way. Then HGR, a hologram reasoning method employs a pool of prepared graph models to derive algebraic equations, which is consistent with the geometric theorems. This method is able to be updated by adding new graph models into the pool. Lastly, it employs deep reinforcement learning to enhance the efficiency of model selection from the pool. The entire HGR not only ensures high solution accuracy with fewer reasoning steps but also significantly enhances the interpretability of the solution process by providing descriptions of all reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HGR in improving both accuracy and interpretability in solving APGDs.</p>

Our method gathers quality feedback through self-play simulations with Monte Carlo tree search and LLM-based reflection, which can then be used to learn high-level strategic skills such as how to evaluate states that guide the low-level execution.We showcase how our method can be used in both action planning and dialogue generation in the context of games, achieving good performance on both tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate that our method can help train agents with better performance than both traditional reinforcement learning-based approaches and other LLM-based skill learning approaches in games including the Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and The Resistance: Avalon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruct LLM provide a paradigm used in large scale language model to align LLM to human preference. The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and reinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in downstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications. Comparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms being proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most efforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality data. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training metric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the original model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training effectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and original LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes K. Fichte, Markus Hecher, Yasir Mahmood, Arne Meier</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract argumentation is a popular toolkit for modeling, evaluating, and comparing arguments. Relationships between arguments are specified in argumentation frameworks (AFs), and conditions are placed on sets (extensions) of arguments that allow AFs to be evaluated. For more expressiveness, AFs are augmented with \emph{acceptance conditions} on directly interacting arguments or a constraint on the admissible sets of arguments, resulting in dialectic frameworks or constrained argumentation frameworks. In this paper, we consider flexible conditions for \emph{rejecting} an argument from an extension, which we call rejection conditions (RCs). On the technical level, we associate each argument with a specific logic program. We analyze the resulting complexity, including the structural parameter treewidth. Rejection AFs are highly expressive, giving rise to natural problems on higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The cutting edge of applying AI to science is the closed-loop automation of scientific research: robot scientists. We have previously developed two robot scientists: `Adam' (for yeast functional biology), and `Eve' (for early-stage drug design)). We are now developing a next generation robot scientist Genesis. With Genesis we aim to demonstrate that an area of science can be investigated using robot scientists unambiguously faster, and at lower cost, than with human scientists. Here we report progress on the Genesis project. Genesis is designed to automatically improve system biology models with thousands of interacting causal components. When complete Genesis will be able to initiate and execute in parallel one thousand hypothesis-led closed-loop cycles of experiment per-day. Here we describe the core Genesis hardware: the one thousand computer-controlled $\mu$-bioreactors. For the integrated Mass Spectrometry platform we have developed AutonoMS, a system to automatically run, process, and analyse high-throughput experiments. We have also developed Genesis-DB, a database system designed to enable software agents access to large quantities of structured domain information. We have developed RIMBO (Revisions for Improvements of Models in Biology Ontology) to describe the planned hundreds of thousands of changes to the models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Dong, Xiaoyi Fan, Fangxin Wang, Chengming Li, Victor C. M. Leung, Xiping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the invention of GPT2--1.5B in 2019, large language models (LLMs) have transitioned from specialized models to versatile foundation models. The LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot ability, however, require fine-tuning on local datasets and significant resources for deployment. Traditional fine-tuning techniques with the first-order optimizers require substantial GPU memory that exceeds mainstream hardware capability. Therefore, memory-efficient methods are motivated to be investigated. Model compression techniques can reduce energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact so that to support sustainable artificial intelligence advancements. Additionally, large-scale foundation models have expanded to create images, audio, videos, and multi-modal contents, further emphasizing the need for efficient deployment. Therefore, we are motivated to present a comprehensive overview of the prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods over the network edge. We also review the state-of-the-art literatures on model compression to provide a vision on deploying LLMs over the network edge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Uprety, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Haiming Liu, Dawei Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the capability of AI models in comprehending and generating natural language text. They are increasingly being used to empower and deploy agents in real-world scenarios, which make decisions and take actions based on their understanding of the context. Therefore researchers, policy makers and enterprises alike are working towards ensuring that the decisions made by these agents align with human values and user expectations. That being said, human values and decisions are not always straightforward to measure and are subject to different cognitive biases. There is a vast section of literature in Behavioural Science which studies biases in human judgements. In this work we report an ongoing investigation on alignment of LLMs with human judgements affected by order bias. Specifically, we focus on a famous human study which showed evidence of order effects in similarity judgements, and replicate it with various popular LLMs. We report the different settings where LLMs exhibit human-like order effect bias and discuss the implications of these findings to inform the design and development of LLM based applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style. ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the 8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories, recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a 4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Zeng, Fei Ren, Xinpeng Zhou, Yihang Wang, Yingxia Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Although instruction tuning is widely used to adjust behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), extensive empirical evidence and research indicates that it is primarily a process where the model fits to specific task formats, rather than acquiring new knowledge or capabilities. We propose that this limitation stems from biased features learned during instruction tuning, which differ from ideal task-specfic features, leading to learn less underlying semantics in downstream tasks. However, ideal features are unknown and incalculable, constraining past work to rely on prior knowledge to assist reasoning or training, which limits LLMs' capabilities to the developers' abilities, rather than data-driven scalable learning. In our paper, through our novel data synthesis method, DELIA (Diversity-Enhanced Learning for Instruction Adaptation), we leverage the buffering effect of extensive diverse data in LLMs training to transform biased features in instruction tuning into approximations of ideal features, without explicit prior ideal features. Experiments show DELIA's better performance compared to common instruction tuning and other baselines. It outperforms common instruction tuning by 17.07%-33.41% on Icelandic-English translation bleurt score (WMT-21 dataset, gemma-7b-it) and improves accuracy by 36.1% on formatted text generation (Llama2-7b-chat). Notably, among knowledge injection methods we've known, DELIA uniquely align the internal representations of new special tokens with their prior semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Xie, Jinyu Mo, Defu Lian, Jie Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by distributed selection problems, we formulate a new variant of multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, which captures stochastic arrival of requests to each arm, as well as the policy of allocating requests to players. The challenge is how to design a distributed learning algorithm such that players select arms according to the optimal arm pulling profile (an arm pulling profile prescribes the number of players at each arm) without communicating to each other. We first design a greedy algorithm, which locates one of the optimal arm pulling profiles with a polynomial computational complexity. We also design an iterative distributed algorithm for players to commit to an optimal arm pulling profile with a constant number of rounds in expectation. We apply the explore then commit (ETC) framework to address the online setting when model parameters are unknown. We design an exploration strategy for players to estimate the optimal arm pulling profile. Since such estimates can be different across different players, it is challenging for players to commit. We then design an iterative distributed algorithm, which guarantees that players can arrive at a consensus on the optimal arm pulling profile in only M rounds. We conduct experiments to validate our algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Choi, Hyunsung Kim, Minho Lee, Chang-Jo Kim, Jinsung Yoon, Sang-Ki Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinqi Su, Yawen Cui, Ajian Liu, Xun Lin, Yuhao Wang, Haochen Liang, Wenhui Li, Zitong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In current web environment, fake news spreads rapidly across online social networks, posing serious threats to society. Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most of the work on learning action models focus on learning the actions' dynamics from input plans. This allows us to specify the valid plans of a planning task. However, very little work focuses on learning action costs, which in turn allows us to rank the different plans. In this paper we introduce a new problem: that of learning the costs of a set of actions such that a set of input plans are optimal under the resulting planning model. To solve this problem we present $LACFIP^k$, an algorithm to learn action's costs from unlabeled input plans. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing how $LACFIP^k$ can successfully solve this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Xie, Mingze Zhong, Defu Lian, Zhen Wang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Online rating systems are often used in numerous web or mobile applications, e.g., Amazon and TripAdvisor, to assess the ground-truth quality of products. Due to herding effects, the aggregation of historical ratings (or historical collective opinion) can significantly influence subsequent ratings, leading to misleading and erroneous assessments. We study how to manage product ratings via rating aggregation rules and shortlisted representative reviews, for the purpose of correcting the assessment error. We first develop a mathematical model to characterize important factors of herding effects in product ratings. We then identify sufficient conditions (via the stochastic approximation theory), under which the historical collective opinion converges to the ground-truth collective opinion of the whole user population. These conditions identify a class of rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms that can reveal the ground-truth product quality. We also quantify the speed of convergence (via the martingale theory), which reflects the efficiency of rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms. We prove that the herding effects slow down the speed of convergence while an accurate review selection mechanism can speed it up. We also study the speed of convergence numerically and reveal trade-offs in selecting rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms. To show the utility of our framework, we design a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer model parameters from ratings, and conduct experiments on rating datasets from Amazon and TripAdvisor. We show that proper recency aware rating aggregation rules can improve the speed of convergence in Amazon and TripAdvisor by 41% and 62% respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baekryun Seong, Jieung Kim, Sang-Ki Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, AI research has primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), and increasing accuracy often involves scaling up and consuming more power. The power consumption of AI has become a significant societal issue; in this context, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution. SNNs operate event-driven, like the human brain, and compress information temporally. These characteristics allow SNNs to significantly reduce power consumption compared to perceptron-based artificial neural networks (ANNs), highlighting them as a next-generation neural network technology. However, societal concerns regarding AI go beyond power consumption, with the reliability of AI models being a global issue. For instance, adversarial attacks on AI models are a well-studied problem in the context of traditional neural networks. Despite their importance, the stability and property verification of SNNs remains in the early stages of research. Most SNN verification methods are time-consuming and barely scalable, making practical applications challenging. In this paper, we introduce temporal encoding to achieve practical performance in verifying the adversarial robustness of SNNs. We conduct a theoretical analysis of this approach and demonstrate its success in verifying SNNs at previously unmanageable scales. Our contribution advances SNN verification to a practical level, facilitating the safer application of SNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the emergence of more and more economy-specific LLMS, how to measure whether they can be safely invested in production becomes a problem. Previous research has primarily focused on evaluating the performance of LLMs within specific application scenarios. However, these benchmarks cannot reflect the theoretical level and generalization ability, and the backward datasets are increasingly unsuitable for problems in real scenarios. In this paper, we have compiled a new benchmark, MTFinEval, focusing on the LLMs' basic knowledge of economics, which can always be used as a basis for judgment. To examine only theoretical knowledge as much as possible, MTFinEval is build with foundational questions from university textbooks,and exam papers in economics and management major. Aware of the overall performance of LLMs do not depend solely on one subdiscipline of economics, MTFinEval comprise 360 questions refined from six major disciplines of economics, and reflect capabilities more comprehensively. Experiment result shows all LLMs perform poorly on MTFinEval, which proves that our benchmark built on basic knowledge is very successful. Our research not only offers guidance for selecting the appropriate LLM for specific use cases, but also put forward increase the rigor reliability of LLMs from the basics.</p>

<p>Abstract: While previous chapters focused on recommendation systems (RSs) based on standardized, non-verbal user feedback such as purchases, views, and clicks -- the advent of LLMs has unlocked the use of natural language (NL) interactions for recommendation. This chapter discusses how LLMs' abilities for general NL reasoning present novel opportunities to build highly personalized RSs -- which can effectively connect nuanced and diverse user preferences to items, potentially via interactive dialogues. To begin this discussion, we first present a taxonomy of the key data sources for language-driven recommendation, covering item descriptions, user-system interactions, and user profiles. We then proceed to fundamental techniques for LLM recommendation, reviewing the use of encoder-only and autoregressive LLM recommendation in both tuned and untuned settings. Afterwards, we move to multi-module recommendation architectures in which LLMs interact with components such as retrievers and RSs in multi-stage pipelines. This brings us to architectures for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), in which LLMs facilitate multi-turn dialogues where each turn presents an opportunity not only to make recommendations, but also to engage with the user in interactive preference elicitation, critiquing, and question-answering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Teachers are important to imparting knowledge and guiding learners, and the role of large language models (LLMs) as potential educators is emerging as an important area of study. Recognizing LLMs' capability to generate educational content can lead to advances in automated and personalized learning. While LLMs have been tested for their comprehension and problem-solving skills, their capability in teaching remains largely unexplored. In teaching, questioning is a key skill that guides students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize core concepts and principles. Therefore, our research introduces a benchmark to evaluate the questioning capability in education as a teacher of LLMs through evaluating their generated educational questions, utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl's taxonomy across general, monodisciplinary, and interdisciplinary domains. We shift the focus from LLMs as learners to LLMs as educators, assessing their teaching capability through guiding them to generate questions. We apply four metrics, including relevance, coverage, representativeness, and consistency, to evaluate the educational quality of LLMs' outputs. Our results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates significant potential in teaching general, humanities, and science courses; Claude2 appears more apt as an interdisciplinary teacher. Furthermore, the automatic scores align with human perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley</p>
<p>Abstract: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds.</p>

Existing machine learning architectures often struggle to represent these algorithmic decisions as discrete state transitions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework: GraphFSA (Graph Finite State Automaton). GraphFSA is designed to learn a finite state automaton that runs on each node of a given graph. We test GraphFSA on cellular automata problems, showcasing its abilities in a straightforward algorithmic setting. For a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our framework, we create a diverse range of synthetic problems. As our main application, we then focus on learning more elaborate graph algorithms. Our findings suggest that GraphFSA exhibits strong generalization and extrapolation abilities, presenting an alternative approach to represent these algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyong Zhang, Aniket Gupta, Huaizu Jiang, Hanumant Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is crucial for various real-world applications. While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances high accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we introduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands light while providing close to state of the art accuracy. Compares to other state of the art methods, our model achieves a 10x-70x speedup while maintaining comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world data. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates integrating large language models (LLMs) with advanced hardware, focusing on developing a general-purpose device designed for enhanced interaction with LLMs. Initially, we analyze the current landscape, where virtual assistants and LLMs are reshaping human-technology interactions, highlighting pivotal advancements and setting the stage for a new era of intelligent hardware. Despite substantial progress in LLM technology, a significant gap exists in hardware development, particularly concerning scalability, efficiency, affordability, and multimodal capabilities. This disparity presents both challenges and opportunities, underscoring the need for hardware that is not only powerful but also versatile and capable of managing the sophisticated demands of modern computation. Our proposed device addresses these needs by emphasizing scalability, multimodal data processing, enhanced user interaction, and privacy considerations, offering a comprehensive platform for LLM integration in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neha R. Gupta, Jessica Hullman, Hari Subramonyam</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in Responsible AI has developed a range of principles and practices to ensure that machine learning systems are used in a manner that is ethical and aligned with human values. However, a critical yet often neglected aspect of ethical ML is the ethical implications that appear when designing evaluations of ML systems. For instance, teams may have to balance a trade-off between highly informative tests to ensure downstream product safety, with potential fairness harms inherent to the implemented testing procedures. We conceptualize ethics-related concerns in standard ML evaluation techniques. Specifically, we present a utility framework, characterizing the key trade-off in ethical evaluation as balancing information gain against potential ethical harms. The framework is then a tool for characterizing challenges teams face, and systematically disentangling competing considerations that teams seek to balance. Differentiating between different types of issues encountered in evaluation allows us to highlight best practices from analogous domains, such as clinical trials and automotive crash testing, which navigate these issues in ways that can offer inspiration to improve evaluation processes in ML. Our analysis underscores the critical need for development teams to deliberately assess and manage ethical complexities that arise during the evaluation of ML systems, and for the industry to move towards designing institutional policies to support ethical evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghee Lee, Maho Kohga, Steve Landau, Sile O'Modhrain, Hari Subramonyam</p>
<p>Abstract: People with visual impairments often struggle to create content that relies heavily on visual elements, particularly when conveying spatial and structural information. Existing accessible drawing tools, which construct images line by line, are suitable for simple tasks like math but not for more expressive artwork. On the other hand, emerging generative AI-based text-to-image tools can produce expressive illustrations from descriptions in natural language, but they lack precise control over image composition and properties. To address this gap, our work integrates generative AI with a constructive approach that provides users with enhanced control and editing capabilities. Our system, AltCanvas, features a tile-based interface enabling users to construct visual scenes incrementally, with each tile representing an object within the scene. Users can add, edit, move, and arrange objects while receiving speech and audio feedback. Once completed, the scene can be rendered as a color illustration or as a vector for tactile graphic generation. Involving 14 blind or low-vision users in design and evaluation, we found that participants effectively used the AltCanvas workflow to create illustrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Sestito, Shady Agwa, Themis Prodromakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern hardware architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), other than targeting high performance, aim at dissipating limited energy. Reducing the data movement cost between the computing cores and the memory is a way to mitigate the energy consumption. Systolic arrays are suitable architectures to achieve this objective: they use multiple processing elements that communicate each other to maximize data utilization, based on proper dataflows like the weight stationary and row stationary. Motivated by this, we have proposed TrIM, an innovative dataflow based on a triangular movement of inputs, and capable to reduce the number of memory accesses by one order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art systolic arrays. In this paper, we present a TrIM-based hardware architecture for CNNs. As a showcase, the accelerator is implemented onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to execute the VGG-16 CNN. The architecture achieves a peak throughput of 453.6 Giga Operations per Second, outperforming a state-of-the-art row stationary systolic array by ~5.1x in terms of memory accesses, and being up to ~12.2x more energy-efficient than other FPGA accelerators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananya Pandey, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma</p>
<p>Abstract: Various linguistic and non-linguistic clues, such as excessive emphasis on a word, a shift in the tone of voice, or an awkward expression, frequently convey sarcasm. The computer vision problem of sarcasm recognition in conversation aims to identify hidden sarcastic, criticizing, and metaphorical information embedded in everyday dialogue. Prior, sarcasm recognition has focused mainly on text. Still, it is critical to consider all textual information, audio stream, facial expression, and body position for reliable sarcasm identification. Hence, we propose a novel approach that combines a lightweight depth attention module with a self-regulated ConvNet to concentrate on the most crucial features of visual data and an attentional tokenizer based strategy to extract the most critical context-specific information from the textual data. The following is a list of the key contributions that our experimentation has made in response to performing the task of Multi-modal Sarcasm Recognition: an attentional tokenizer branch to get beneficial features from the glossary content provided by the subtitles; a visual branch for acquiring the most prominent features from the video frames; an utterance-level feature extraction from acoustic content and a multi-headed attention based feature fusion branch to blend features obtained from multiple modalities. Extensive testing on one of the benchmark video datasets, MUSTaRD, yielded an accuracy of 79.86% for speaker dependent and 76.94% for speaker independent configuration demonstrating that our approach is superior to the existing methods. We have also conducted a cross-dataset analysis to test the adaptability of VyAnG-Net with unseen samples of another dataset MUStARD++.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangbin Zheng, Han Zhang, Qianqing Xu, An-Ping Zeng, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Enzyme design plays a crucial role in both industrial production and biology. However, this field faces challenges due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks and the complexity of enzyme design tasks, leading to a dearth of systematic research. Consequently, computational enzyme design is relatively overlooked within the broader protein domain and remains in its early stages. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing MetaEnzyme, a staged and unified enzyme design framework. We begin by employing a cross-modal structure-to-sequence transformation architecture, as the feature-driven starting point to obtain initial robust protein representation. Subsequently, we leverage domain adaptive techniques to generalize specific enzyme design tasks under low-resource conditions. MetaEnzyme focuses on three fundamental low-resource enzyme redesign tasks: functional design (FuncDesign), mutation design (MutDesign), and sequence generation design (SeqDesign). Through novel unified paradigm and enhanced representation capabilities, MetaEnzyme demonstrates adaptability to diverse enzyme design tasks, yielding outstanding results. Wet lab experiments further validate these findings, reinforcing the efficacy of the redesign process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananya Pandey, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma</p>
<p>Abstract: The natural language processing and multimedia field has seen a notable surge in interest in multimodal sentiment recognition. Hence, this study aims to employ Target-Dependent Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (TDMSA) to identify the level of sentiment associated with every target (aspect) stated within a multimodal post consisting of a visual-caption pair. Despite the recent advancements in multimodal sentiment recognition, there has been a lack of explicit incorporation of emotional clues from the visual modality, specifically those pertaining to facial expressions. The challenge at hand is to proficiently obtain visual and emotional clues and subsequently synchronise them with the textual content. In light of this fact, this study presents a novel approach called the Visual-to-Emotional-Caption Translation Network (VECTN) technique. The primary objective of this strategy is to effectively acquire visual sentiment clues by analysing facial expressions. Additionally, it effectively aligns and blends the obtained emotional clues with the target attribute of the caption mode. The experimental findings demonstrate that our methodology is capable of producing ground-breaking outcomes when applied to two publicly accessible multimodal Twitter datasets, namely, Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017. The experimental results show that the suggested model achieves an accuracy of 81.23% and a macro-F1 of 80.61% on the Twitter-15 dataset, while 77.42% and 75.19% on the Twitter-17 dataset, respectively. The observed improvement in performance reveals that our model is better than others when it comes to collecting target-level sentiment in multimodal data using the expressions of the face.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These "global patterns" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi, Mei Liu, Zijun Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in sequential modeling applied to Electronic Health Records (EHR) have greatly influenced prescription recommender systems. While the recent literature on drug recommendation has shown promising performance, the study of discovering a diversity of coexisting temporal relationships at the level of medical codes over consecutive visits remains less explored. The goal of this study can be motivated from two perspectives. First, there is a need to develop a sophisticated sequential model capable of disentangling the complex relationships across sequential visits. Second, it is crucial to establish multiple and diverse health profiles for the same patient to ensure a comprehensive consideration of different medical intents in drug recommendation. To achieve this goal, we introduce Attentive Recommendation with Contrasted Intents (ARCI), a multi-level transformer-based method designed to capture the different but coexisting temporal paths across a shared sequence of visits. Specifically, we propose a novel intent-aware method with contrastive learning, that links specialized medical intents of the patients to the transformer heads for extracting distinct temporal paths associated with different health profiles. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets for the prescription recommendation task using both ranking and classification metrics. Our results demonstrate that ARCI has outperformed the state-of-the-art prescription recommendation methods and is capable of providing interpretable insights for healthcare practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Ricordi archive, a prestigious collection of significant musical manuscripts from renowned opera composers such as Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, has been digitized. This process has allowed us to automatically extract samples that represent various musical elements depicted on the manuscripts, including notes, staves, clefs, erasures, and composer's annotations, among others. To distinguish between digitization noise and actual music elements, a subset of these images was meticulously grouped and labeled by multiple individuals into several classes. After assessing the consistency of the annotations, we trained multiple neural network-based classifiers to differentiate between the identified music elements. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of these classifiers, with the ultimate goal of using them for the automatic categorization of the remaining unannotated data set. The dataset, complemented by manual annotations, models, and source code used in these experiments are publicly accessible for replication purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Morris, David J. Tena Cucala, Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are frequently used to predict missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). Motivated by the lack of explainability for the outputs of these models, recent work has aimed to explain their predictions using Datalog, a widely used logic-based formalism. However, such work has been restricted to certain subclasses of GNNs. In this paper, we consider one of the most popular GNN architectures for KGs, R-GCN, and we provide two methods to extract rules that explain its predictions and are sound, in the sense that each fact derived by the rules is also predicted by the GNN, for any input dataset. Furthermore, we provide a method that can verify that certain classes of Datalog rules are not sound for the R-GCN. In our experiments, we train R-GCNs on KG completion benchmarks, and we are able to verify that no Datalog rule is sound for these models, even though the models often obtain high to near-perfect accuracy. This raises some concerns about the ability of R-GCN models to generalise and about the explainability of their predictions. We further provide two variations to the training paradigm of R-GCN that encourage it to learn sound rules and find a trade-off between model accuracy and the number of learned sound rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Gong, Gefei Shen, Luanzheng Guo, Nathan Tallent, Dongfang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most common operations in multimodal scientific data management is searching for the $k$ most similar items (or, $k$-nearest neighbors, KNN) from the database after being provided a new item. Although recent advances of multimodal machine learning models offer a \textit{semantic} index, the so-called \textit{embedding vectors} mapped from the original multimodal data, the dimension of the resulting embedding vectors are usually on the order of hundreds or a thousand, which are impractically high for time-sensitive scientific applications.
  This work proposes to reduce the dimensionality of the output embedding vectors such that the set of top-$k$ nearest neighbors do not change in the lower-dimensional space, namely Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR). In order to develop such an OPDR method, our central hypothesis is that by analyzing the intrinsic relationship among key parameters during the dimension-reduction map, a quantitative function may be constructed to reveal the correlation between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. To demonstrate the hypothesis, this paper first defines a formal measure function to quantify the KNN similarity for a specific vector, then extends the measure into an aggregate accuracy of the global metric spaces, and finally derives a closed-form function between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. We incorporate the closed-function into popular dimension-reduction methods, various distance metrics, and embedding models.</p>

Recently, diffusion models have been further applied and show their strong abilities in planning tasks, leading to a significant growth in related publications since 2023. To help researchers better understand the field and promote the development of the field, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent advancements in the application of diffusion models for planning. Specifically, this paper categorizes and discusses the current literature from the following perspectives: (i) relevant datasets and benchmarks used for evaluating diffusion modelbased planning; (ii) fundamental studies that address aspects such as sampling efficiency; (iii) skill-centric and condition-guided planning for enhancing adaptability; (iv) safety and uncertainty managing mechanism for enhancing safety and robustness; and (v) domain-specific application such as autonomous driving.

Streamliners are constraints that narrow the search space, enhancing the speed and feasibility of solving complex problems. Traditionally, streamliners were crafted manually or generated through systematically combined atomic constraints with high-effort offline testing. Our approach uses LLMs to propose effective streamliners. Our system StreamLLM generates streamlines for problems specified in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the LLM with quick empirical tests. Our rigorous empirical evaluation involving ten problems with several hundreds of test instances shows robust results that are highly encouraging, showcasing the transforming power of LLMs in the domain of constraint programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghang Li, Long Xia, Lei Shi, Yong Xu, Dawei Yin, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for effective urban planning and transportation management, enabling efficient resource allocation and enhanced travel experiences. However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manon Revel, Matteo Cargnelutti, Tyna Eloundou, Greg Leppert</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them - a metric we term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the Anthropic/hh-rlhf preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dose prediction plays a key role in knowledge-based planning (KBP) by automatically generating patient-specific dose distribution. Recent advances in deep learning-based dose prediction methods necessitates collaboration among data contributors for improved performance. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution, enabling medical centers to jointly train deep-learning models without compromising patient data privacy. We developed the FedKBP framework to evaluate the performances of centralized, federated, and individual (i.e. separated) training of dose prediction model on the 340 plans from OpenKBP dataset. To simulate FL and individual training, we divided the data into 8 training sites. To evaluate the effect of inter-site data variation on model training, we implemented two types of case distributions: 1) Independent and identically distributed (IID), where the training and validating cases were evenly divided among the 8 sites, and 2) non-IID, where some sites have more cases than others. The results show FL consistently outperforms individual training on both model optimization speed and out-of-sample testing scores, highlighting the advantage of FL over individual training. Under IID data division, FL shows comparable performance to centralized training, underscoring FL as a promising alternative to traditional pooled-data training. Under non-IID division, larger sites outperformed smaller sites by up to 19% on testing scores, confirming the need of collaboration among data owners to achieve better prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, non-IID FL showed reduced performance as compared to IID FL, posing the need for more sophisticated FL method beyond mere model averaging to handle data variation among participating sites.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yang, Runhan Shi, Zuchao Li, Shu Jiang, Bao-Liang Lu, Yang Yang, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis analysis is pivotal yet challenging in drug discovery and organic chemistry. Despite the proliferation of computational tools over the past decade, AI-based systems often fall short in generalizing across diverse reaction types and exploring alternative synthetic pathways. This paper presents BatGPT-Chem, a large language model with 15 billion parameters, tailored for enhanced retrosynthesis prediction. Integrating chemical tasks via a unified framework of natural language and SMILES notation, this approach synthesizes extensive instructional data from an expansive chemical database. Employing both autoregressive and bidirectional training techniques across over one hundred million instances, BatGPT-Chem captures a broad spectrum of chemical knowledge, enabling precise prediction of reaction conditions and exhibiting strong zero-shot capabilities. Superior to existing AI methods, our model demonstrates significant advancements in generating effective strategies for complex molecules, as validated by stringent benchmark tests. BatGPT-Chem not only boosts the efficiency and creativity of retrosynthetic analysis but also establishes a new standard for computational tools in synthetic design. This development empowers chemists to adeptly address the synthesis of novel compounds, potentially expediting the innovation cycle in drug manufacturing and materials science.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Guojiang Shen, Xiangjie Kong, Xuetao Wei, Liqiang Nie, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: As urban residents demand higher travel quality, vehicle dispatch has become a critical component of online ride-hailing services. However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Dian Lim, Hong Yu Li, Simon Chun Kiat Goh, Xiangyu Wang, Peng Zhao, Chuan Seng Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive representation learning, which aims to learnthe shared information between different views of unlabeled data by maximizing the mutual information between them, has shown its powerful competence in self-supervised learning for downstream tasks. However, recent works have demonstrated that more estimated mutual information does not guarantee better performance in different downstream tasks. Such works inspire us to conjecture that the learned representations not only maintain task-relevant information from unlabeled data but also carry task-irrelevant information which is superfluous for downstream tasks, thus leading to performance degeneration. In this paper we show that superfluous information does exist during the conventional contrastive learning framework, and further design a new objective, namely SuperInfo, to learn robust representations by a linear combination of both predictive and superfluous information. Besides, we notice that it is feasible to tune the coefficients of introduced losses to discard task-irrelevant information, while keeping partial non-shared task-relevant information according to our SuperInfo loss.We demonstrate that learning with our loss can often outperform the traditional contrastive learning approaches on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks with significant improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shyam K Sateesh, Sparsh BK, Uma D</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a thriving field, particularly in neuroscience and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This study aims to understand and improve the predictive accuracy of emotional state classification through metrics such as valence, arousal, dominance, and likeness by applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze EEG signals. Using a popular dataset of multi-channel EEG recordings known as DEAP, we look towards leveraging LSTM networks' properties to handle temporal dependencies within EEG signal data. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding and classification of emotional parameter states. We obtain accuracies of 89.89%, 90.33%, 90.70%, and 90.54% for arousal, valence, dominance, and likeness, respectively, demonstrating significant improvements in emotion recognition model capabilities. This paper elucidates the methodology and architectural specifics of our LSTM model and provides a benchmark analysis with existing papers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunil Arora, Sahil Arora, John D. Hastings</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the meta-issues surrounding social media, which, while theoretically designed to enhance social interactions and improve our social lives by facilitating the sharing of personal experiences and life events, often results in adverse psychological impacts. Our investigation reveals a paradoxical outcome: rather than fostering closer relationships and improving social lives, the algorithms and structures that underlie social media platforms inadvertently contribute to a profound psychological impact on individuals, influencing them in unforeseen ways. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among teenagers, who are disproportionately affected by curated online personas, peer pressure to present a perfect digital image, and the constant bombardment of notifications and updates that characterize their social media experience. As such, we issue a call to action for policymakers, platform developers, and educators to prioritize the well-being of teenagers in the digital age and work towards creating secure and safe social media platforms that protect the young from harm, online harassment, and exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Rifat Raiyan, Zibran Zarif Amio, Sabbir Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 8,340 images of hand shadow puppets across 11 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of traditional convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model InceptionV3 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We describe a datalog query evaluation approach based on efficient and composable boolean matrix manipulation modules. We first define an overarching problem, Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP), which uses boolean matrices as an alternative computation to evaluate datalog programs. We develop two novel BMLP modules for bottom-up inferences on linear dyadic recursive datalog programs, and show how additional modules can extend this capability to compute both linear and non-linear recursive datalog programs of arity two. Our empirical results demonstrate that these modules outperform general-purpose and specialised systems by factors of 30x and 9x, respectively, when evaluating large programs with millions of facts. This boolean matrix approach significantly enhances the efficiency of datalog querying to support logic programming techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Lin, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study reinforcement learning in Markov Decision Processes with Probabilistic Reward Machines (PRMs), a form of non-Markovian reward commonly found in robotics tasks. We design an algorithm for PRMs that achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{HOAT} + H^2O^2A^{3/2} + H\sqrt{T})$, where $H$ is the time horizon, $O$ is the number of observations, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is the number of time-steps. This result improves over the best-known bound, $\widetilde{O}(H\sqrt{OAT})$ of \citet{pmlr-v206-bourel23a} for MDPs with Deterministic Reward Machines (DRMs), a special case of PRMs. When $T \geq H^3O^3A^2$ and $OA \geq H$, our regret bound leads to a regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{HOAT})$, which matches the established lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HOAT})$ for MDPs with DRMs up to a logarithmic factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm for PRMs. Additionally, we present a new simulation lemma for non-Markovian rewards, which enables reward-free exploration for any non-Markovian reward given access to an approximate planner. Complementing our theoretical findings, we show through extensive experiment evaluations that our algorithm indeed outperforms prior methods in various PRM environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Lu, Lakshay Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous methods for audio-image matching generally fall into one of two categories: pipeline models or End-to-End models. Pipeline models first transcribe speech and then encode the resulting text; End-to-End models encode speech directly. Generally, pipeline models outperform end-to-end models, but the intermediate transcription necessarily discards some potentially useful non-textual information. In addition to textual information, speech can convey details such as accent, mood, and and emphasis, which should be effectively captured in the encoded representation. In this paper, we investigate whether non-textual information, which is overlooked by pipeline-based models, can be leveraged to improve speech-image matching performance. We thoroughly analyze and compare End-to-End models, pipeline models, and our proposed dual-channel model for robust audio-image retrieval on a variety of datasets. Our approach achieves a substantial performance gain over the previous state-of-the-art by leveraging strong pretrained models, a prompting mechanism and a bifurcated design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khadija Iddrisu, Waseem Shariff, Noel E. OConnor, Joseph Lemley, Suzanne Little</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Cameras, also known as Neuromorphic sensors, capture changes in local light intensity at the pixel level, producing asynchronously generated data termed ``events''. This distinct data format mitigates common issues observed in conventional cameras, like under-sampling when capturing fast-moving objects, thereby preserving critical information that might otherwise be lost. However, leveraging this data often necessitates the development of specialized, handcrafted event representations that can integrate seamlessly with conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), considering the unique attributes of event data. In this study, We evaluate event-based Face and Eye tracking. The core objective of our study is to showcase the viability of integrating conventional algorithms with event-based data, transformed into a frame format while preserving the unique benefits of event cameras. To validate our approach, we constructed a frame-based event dataset by simulating events between RGB frames derived from the publicly accessible Helen Dataset. We assess its utility for face and eye detection tasks through the application of GR-YOLO -- a pioneering technique derived from YOLOv3. This evaluation includes a comparative analysis with results derived from training the dataset with YOLOv8. Subsequently, the trained models were tested on real event streams from various iterations of Prophesee's event cameras and further evaluated on the Faces in Event Stream (FES) benchmark dataset. The models trained on our dataset shows a good prediction performance across all the datasets obtained for validation with the best results of a mean Average precision score of 0.91. Additionally, The models trained demonstrated robust performance on real event camera data under varying light conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Capturing pupil diameter is essential for assessing psychological and physiological states such as stress levels and cognitive load. However, the low resolution of images in eye datasets often hampers precise measurement. This study evaluates the impact of various upscaling methods, ranging from bicubic interpolation to advanced super-resolution, on pupil diameter predictions. We compare several pre-trained methods, including CodeFormer, GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN, HAT, and SRResNet. Our findings suggest that pupil diameter prediction models trained on upscaled datasets are highly sensitive to the selected upscaling method and scale. Our results demonstrate that upscaling methods consistently enhance the accuracy of pupil diameter prediction models, highlighting the importance of upscaling in pupilometry. Overall, our work provides valuable insights for selecting upscaling techniques, paving the way for more accurate assessments in psychological and physiological research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna-Maria Nau, Phillip Ditto, Dawnie Wolfe Steadman, Audris Mockus</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the stage of decomposition (SOD) is crucial for estimating the postmortem interval and identifying human remains. Currently, labor-intensive manual scoring methods are used for this purpose, but they are subjective and do not scale for the emerging large-scale archival collections of human decomposition photos. This study explores the feasibility of automating two common human decomposition scoring methods proposed by Megyesi and Gelderman using artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluated two popular deep learning models, Inception V3 and Xception, by training them on a large dataset of human decomposition images to classify the SOD for different anatomical regions, including the head, torso, and limbs. Additionally, an interrater study was conducted to assess the reliability of the AI models compared to human forensic examiners for SOD identification. The Xception model achieved the best classification performance, with macro-averaged F1 scores of .878, .881, and .702 for the head, torso, and limbs when predicting Megyesi's SODs, and .872, .875, and .76 for the head, torso, and limbs when predicting Gelderman's SODs. The interrater study results supported AI's ability to determine the SOD at a reliability level comparable to a human expert. This work demonstrates the potential of AI models trained on a large dataset of human decomposition images to automate SOD identification.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity and demand for faster, energy-efficient hardware designs necessitate innovative High-Level Synthesis (HLS) methodologies. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline or replace the HLS process, leveraging their ability to understand natural language specifications and refactor code. We survey the current research and conduct experiments comparing Verilog designs generated by a standard HLS tool (Vitis HLS) with those produced by LLMs translating C code or natural language specifications. Our evaluation focuses on quantifying the impact on performance, power, and resource utilization, providing an assessment of the efficiency of LLM-based approaches. This study aims to illuminate the role of LLMs in HLS, identifying promising directions for optimized hardware design in applications such as AI acceleration, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.</p>

Feature engineering has been historically addressed by carefully hand-crafting data representations based on domain expertise. This work views the internal representations of modern deep neural networks (DNNs), called embeddings, as an automated form of traditional feature engineering. For trained DNNs, we show that these embeddings can reveal interpretable, high-level concepts in unstructured sample data. We use these embeddings in natural language and computer vision tasks to uncover both inherent heterogeneity in the underlying data and human-understandable explanations for it. In particular, we find empirical evidence that there is inherent separability between real data and that generated from AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niyar R Barman, Krish Sharma, Ashhar Aziz, Shashwat Bajpai, Shwetangshu Biswas, Vasu Sharma, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amit Sheth, Amitava Das</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image generation systems, exemplified by models like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Imagen, and DALL-E, has heightened concerns about their potential misuse. In response, companies like Meta and Google have intensified their efforts to implement watermarking techniques on AI-generated images to curb the circulation of potentially misleading visuals. However, in this paper, we argue that current image watermarking methods are fragile and susceptible to being circumvented through visual paraphrase attacks. The proposed visual paraphraser operates in two steps. First, it generates a caption for the given image using KOSMOS-2, one of the latest state-of-the-art image captioning systems. Second, it passes both the original image and the generated caption to an image-to-image diffusion system. During the denoising step of the diffusion pipeline, the system generates a visually similar image that is guided by the text caption. The resulting image is a visual paraphrase and is free of any watermarks. Our empirical findings demonstrate that visual paraphrase attacks can effectively remove watermarks from images. This paper provides a critical assessment, empirically revealing the vulnerability of existing watermarking techniques to visual paraphrase attacks. While we do not propose solutions to this issue, this paper serves as a call to action for the scientific community to prioritize the development of more robust watermarking techniques. Our first-of-its-kind visual paraphrase dataset and accompanying code are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents Rummaging Using Mutual Information (RUMI), a method for online generation of robot action sequences to gather information about the pose of a known movable object in visually-occluded environments. Focusing on contact-rich rummaging, our approach leverages mutual information between the object pose distribution and robot trajectory for action planning. From an observed partial point cloud, RUMI deduces the compatible object pose distribution and approximates the mutual information of it with workspace occupancy in real time. Based on this, we develop an information gain cost function and a reachability cost function to keep the object within the robot's reach. These are integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework with a stochastic dynamics model, updating the pose distribution in a closed loop. Key contributions include a new belief framework for object pose estimation, an efficient information gain computation strategy, and a robust MPC-based control scheme. RUMI demonstrates superior performance in both simulated and real tasks compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in many different domains, but because of their limited interpretability, there are questions about how trustworthy they are in various perspectives, e.g., truthfulness and toxicity. Recent research has started developing testing methods for LLMs, aiming to uncover untrustworthy issues, i.e., defects, before deployment. However, systematic and formalized testing criteria are lacking, which hinders a comprehensive assessment of the extent and adequacy of testing exploration. To mitigate this threat, we propose a set of multi-level testing criteria, LeCov, for LLMs. The criteria consider three crucial LLM internal components, i.e., the attention mechanism, feed-forward neurons, and uncertainty, and contain nine types of testing criteria in total. We apply the criteria in two scenarios: test prioritization and coverage-guided testing. The experiment evaluation, on three models and four datasets, demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of LeCov.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assigning orders to drivers under localized spatiotemporal context (micro-view order-dispatching) is a major task in Didi, as it influences ride-hailing service experience. Existing industrial solutions mainly follow a two-stage pattern that incorporate heuristic or learning-based algorithms with naive combinatorial methods, tackling the uncertainty of both sides' behaviors, including emerging timings, spatial relationships, and travel duration, etc. In this paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning based order-dispatching approach that solves behavior prediction and combinatorial optimization uniformly in a sequential decision-making manner. Specifically, we employ a two-layer Markov Decision Process framework to model this problem, and present \underline{D}eep \underline{D}ouble \underline{S}calable \underline{N}etwork (D2SN), an encoder-decoder structure network to generate order-driver assignments directly and stop assignments accordingly. Besides, by leveraging contextual dynamics, our approach can adapt to the behavioral patterns for better performance. Extensive experiments on Didi's real-world benchmarks justify that the proposed approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines in optimizing matching efficiency and user experience tasks. In addition, we evaluate the deployment outline and discuss the gains and experiences obtained during the deployment tests from the view of large-scale engineering implementation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has significantly influenced the development of new therapeutic agents. These computational methods can be used to design and predict the properties of generated molecules. Multi-target Drug Discovery (MTDD) is an emerging paradigm for discovering drugs against complex disorders that do not respond well to more traditional target-specific treatments, such as central nervous system, immune system, and cardiovascular diseases. Still, there is yet to be an established benchmark suite for assessing the effectiveness of AI tools for designing multi-target compounds. Standardized benchmarks allow for comparing existing techniques and promote rapid research progress. Hence, this work proposes an evaluation framework for molecule generation techniques in MTDD scenarios, considering brain diseases as a case study. Our methodology involves using large language models to select the appropriate molecular targets, gathering and preprocessing the bioassay datasets, training quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict target modulation, and assessing other essential drug-likeness properties for implementing the benchmarks. Additionally, this work will assess the performance of four deep generative models and evolutionary algorithms over our benchmark suite.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Chao wang, Shiao Wang, Xixi Wang, Zhicheng Zhao, Lin Zhu, Bo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Event camera-based visual tracking has drawn more and more attention in recent years due to the unique imaging principle and advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, and dense temporal resolution. Current event-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance bottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static template for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Mamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with linear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template are fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and interaction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a dynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory Mamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template library and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a more effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of dynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to achieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple large-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Yao Rong, Fuling Wang, Jianing Li, Lin Zhu, Bo Jiang, Yaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability. Unlike traditional SLT based on visible light videos, which is easily affected by factors such as lighting, rapid hand movements, and privacy breaches, this paper proposes the use of high-definition Event streams for SLT, effectively mitigating the aforementioned issues. This is primarily because Event streams have a high dynamic range and dense temporal signals, which can withstand low illumination and motion blur well. Additionally, due to their sparsity in space, they effectively protect the privacy of the target person. More specifically, we propose a new high-resolution Event stream sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively fills the data gap in this area of research. It contains 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected in a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes, encompassing multiple angles, light intensities, and camera movements. We have benchmarked existing mainstream SLT works to enable fair comparison for future efforts. Based on this dataset and several other large-scale datasets, we propose a novel baseline method that fully leverages the Mamba model's ability to integrate temporal information of CNN features, resulting in improved sign language translation outcomes. Both the benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Chevalier (Dj), Duncan Starkenburg (Dj),  Krishnamurthy (Dj),  Dvijotham</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of formal verification, Neural Networks (NNs) are typically reformulated into equivalent mathematical programs which are optimized over. To overcome the inherent non-convexity of these reformulations, convex relaxations of nonlinear activation functions are typically utilized. Common relaxations (i.e., static linear cuts) of ``S-shaped" activation functions, however, can be overly loose, slowing down the overall verification process. In this paper, we derive tuneable hyperplanes which upper and lower bound the sigmoid activation function. When tuned in the dual space, these affine bounds smoothly rotate around the nonlinear manifold of the sigmoid activation function. This approach, termed $\alpha$-sig, allows us to tractably incorporate the tightest possible, element-wise convex relaxation of the sigmoid activation function into a formal verification framework. We embed these relaxations inside of large verification tasks and compare their performance to LiRPA and $\alpha$-CROWN, a state-of-the-art verification duo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianian Gong, Nachuan Duan, Ziheng Tao, Zhaohui Gong, Yuan Yuan, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Wang, Xu Huang, Bowen Tian, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative LLM have achieved significant success in various industrial tasks and can effectively adapt to vertical domains and downstream tasks through ICL. However, with tasks becoming increasingly complex, the context length required by ICL is also getting longer, and two significant issues arise: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem.
  Recently, compressing prompts by removing tokens according to some metric obtained from some causal language models, such as llama-7b, has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. However, the metric used by prior method such as self-information or PPL do not fully align with the objective of distinuishing the most important tokens when conditioning on query. In this work, we introduce information bottleneck theory to carefully examine the properties required by the metric. Inspired by this, we use cross-attention in encoder-decoder architecture as a new metric. Our simple method leads to significantly better performance in smaller models with lower latency.
  We evaluate our method on four datasets: DROP, CoQA, SQuAD, and Quoref. The experimental results show that, while maintaining the same performance, our compression rate can improve by nearly 25% over previous SOTA. Remarkably, in experiments where 25% of the tokens are removed, our model's EM score for answers sometimes even exceeds that of the control group using uncompressed text as context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing visual assistive technologies are built for simple and common use cases, and have few avenues for blind people to customize their functionalities. Drawing from prior work on DIY assistive technology, this paper investigates end-user programming as a means for users to create and customize visual access programs to meet their unique needs. We introduce ProgramAlly, a system for creating custom filters for visual information, e.g., 'find NUMBER on BUS', leveraging three end-user programming approaches: block programming, natural language, and programming by example. To implement ProgramAlly, we designed a representation of visual filtering tasks based on scenarios encountered by blind people, and integrated a set of on-device and cloud models for generating and running these programs. In user studies with 12 blind adults, we found that participants preferred different programming modalities depending on the task, and envisioned using visual access programs to address unique accessibility challenges that are otherwise difficult with existing applications. Through ProgramAlly, we present an exploration of how blind end-users can create visual access programs to customize and control their experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Thi Nguyen, Campbell Wilson, Janis Dalins</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the forensic value of hand images involves the use of unique features and patterns present in an individual's hand. The human hand has distinct characteristics, such as the pattern of veins, fingerprints, and the geometry of the hand itself. This paper investigates the use of vision transformers (ViTs) for classification of hand images. We use explainability tools to explore the internal representations of ViTs and assess their impact on the model outputs. Utilizing the internal understanding of ViTs, we introduce distillation methods that allow a student model to adaptively extract knowledge from a teacher model while learning on data of a different domain to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Two publicly available hand image datasets are used to conduct a series of experiments to evaluate performance of the ViTs and our proposed adaptive distillation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that ViT models significantly outperform traditional machine learning methods and the internal states of ViTs are useful for explaining the model outputs in the classification task. By averting catastrophic forgetting, our distillation methods achieve excellent performance on data from both source and target domains, particularly when these two domains exhibit significant dissimilarity. The proposed approaches therefore can be developed and implemented effectively for real-world applications such as access control, identity verification, and authentication systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huifa Li, Jie Fu, Xinpeng Ling, Zhiyu Sun, Kuncan Wang, Zhili Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-decoder (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives corresponding to three decoders, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wall Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Return-Conditioned Transformer Decision Models (RCTDM) have demonstrated the potential to enhance transformer performance in offline reinforcement learning by replacing rewards in the input sequence with returns-to-go. However, to achieve the goal of learning an optimal policy from offline datasets composed of limited suboptimal trajectories, RCTDM required alternative methods. One prominent approach, trajectory stitching, was designed to enable the network to combine multiple trajectories to find the optimal path. To implement this using only transformers without auxiliary networks, it was necessary to shorten the input sequence length to better capture the Markov property in reinforcement learnings. This, however, introduced a trade-off, as it reduced the accuracy of action inference. Our study introduces a model named Decision MetaMamba to resolve these challenges. DMM employs an input token mixer to extract patterns from short sequences and uses a State Space Model (SSM) to selectively combine information from relatively distant sequences. Inspired by Metaformer, this structure was developed by transforming Mamba's input layer into various multi-modal layers. Fortunately, with the advent of Mamba, implemented using parallel selective scanning, we achieved a high-performance sequence model capable of replacing transformers. Based on these innovations, DMM demonstrated excellent performance across various datasets in offline RL, confirming that models using SSM can improve performance by domain-specific alterations of the input layer. Additionally, it maintained its performance even in lightweight models with fewer parameters. These results suggest that decision models based on SSM can pave the way for improved outcomes in future developments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contextualized ASR models have been demonstrated to effectively improve the recognition accuracy of uncommon phrases when a predefined phrase list is available. However, these models often struggle with bilingual settings, which are prevalent in code-switching speech recognition. In this study, we make the initial attempt to address this challenge by introducing a Cross-lingual Contextual Biasing(XCB) module. Specifically, we augment a pre-trained ASR model for the dominant language by integrating an auxiliary language biasing module and a supplementary language-specific loss, aimed at enhancing the recognition of phrases in the secondary language. Experimental results conducted on our in-house code-switching dataset have validated the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the recognition of biasing phrases in the secondary language, even without any additional inference overhead. Additionally, our proposed system exhibits both efficiency and generalization when is applied by the unseen ASRU-2019 test set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers, renowned for their powerful feature extraction capabilities, have played an increasingly prominent role in various vision tasks. Especially, recent advancements present transformer with hierarchical structures such as Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), demonstrating outstanding ability to efficiently capture both global and local features. However, transformers' application in edge detection has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose EdgeNAT, a one-stage transformer-based edge detector with DiNAT as the encoder, capable of extracting object boundaries and meaningful edges both accurately and efficiently. On the one hand, EdgeNAT captures global contextual information and detailed local cues with DiNAT, on the other hand, it enhances feature representation with a novel SCAF-MLA decoder by utilizing both inter-spatial and inter-channel relationships of feature maps. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both RGB and depth images. Notably, on the widely used BSDS500 dataset, our L model achieves impressive performances, with ODS F-measure and OIS F-measure of 86.0%, 87.6% for multi-scale input,and 84.9%, and 86.3% for single-scale input, surpassing the current state-of-the-art EDTER by 1.2%, 1.1%, 1.7%, and 1.6%, respectively. Moreover, as for throughput, our approach runs at 20.87 FPS on RTX 4090 GPU with single-scale input. The code for our method will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: With diet and nutrition apps reaching 1.4 billion users in 2022 [1], it's no surprise that health apps like MyFitnessPal, Noom, and Calorie Counter, are surging in popularity. However, one major setback [2] of nearly all nutrition applications is that users must enter food data manually, which is time-consuming and tedious. Thus, there has been an increasing demand for applications that can accurately identify food items, analyze their nutritional content, and offer dietary recommendations in real-time. This paper introduces a comprehensive system that combines advanced computer vision techniques with nutrition analysis, implemented in a versatile mobile and web application. The system is divided into three key components: 1) food detection using the YOLOv8 model, 2) nutrient analysis via the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API, and 3) personalized meal recommendations using the Edamam Meal Planning and Recipe Search APIs. Designed for both mobile and web platforms, the application ensures fast processing times with an intuitive user interface, with features such as data visualizations using Chart.js, a login system, and personalized settings for dietary preferences, allergies, and cuisine choices. Preliminary results showcase the system's effectiveness, making it a valuable tool for users to make informed dietary decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stable diffusion networks have emerged as a groundbreaking development for their ability to produce realistic and detailed visual content. This characteristic renders them ideal decoders, capable of producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based point cloud compression method, dubbed Diff-PCC, to leverage the expressive power of the diffusion model for generative and aesthetically superior decoding. Different from the conventional autoencoder fashion, a dual-space latent representation is devised in this paper, in which a compressor composed of two independent encoding backbones is considered to extract expressive shape latents from distinct latent spaces. At the decoding side, a diffusion-based generator is devised to produce high-quality reconstructions by considering the shape latents as guidance to stochastically denoise the noisy point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Diff-PCC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance (e.g., 7.711 dB BD-PSNR gains against the latest G-PCC standard at ultra-low bitrate) while attaining superior subjective quality.

<p>Abstract: We propose a stable model semantics for higher-order logic programs. Our semantics is developed using Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT), a powerful formalism that has successfully been used to give meaning to diverse non-monotonic formalisms. The proposed semantics generalizes the classical two-valued stable model semantics of (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) as-well-as the three-valued one of (Przymusinski 1990), retaining their desirable properties. Due to the use of AFT, we also get for free alternative semantics for higher-order logic programs, namely supported model, Kripke-Kleene, and well-founded. Additionally, we define a broad class of stratified higher-order logic programs and demonstrate that they have a unique two-valued higher-order stable model which coincides with the well-founded semantics of such programs. We provide a number of examples in different application domains, which demonstrate that higher-order logic programming under the stable model semantics is a powerful and versatile formalism, which can potentially form the basis of novel ASP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Zhao, Divya Saxena, Jiannong Cao, Xiaoyun Liu, Changlin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: In continual learning (CL), model growth enhances adaptability over new data, improving knowledge retention for more tasks. However, improper model growth can lead to severe degradation of previously learned knowledge, an issue we name as growth-induced forgetting (GIFt), especially in task-agnostic CL using entire grown model for inference. Existing works, despite adopting model growth and random initialization for better adaptability, often fail to recognize the presence of GIFt caused by improper model growth. This oversight limits comprehensive control of forgetting and hinders full utilization of model growth. We are the first in CL to identify this issue and conduct an in-depth study on root cause of GIFt, where layer expansion stands out among model growth strategies, widening layers without affecting model functionality. Yet, direct adoption of layer expansion presents challenges. It lacks data-driven control and initialization of expanded parameters to balance adaptability and knowledge retention. This paper presents a novel SparseGrow approach to overcome the issue of GIFt while enhancing adaptability over new data. SparseGrow employs data-driven sparse layer expansion to control efficient parameter usage during growth, reducing GIFt from excessive growth and functionality changes. It also combines sparse growth with on-data initialization at training late-stage to create partially 0-valued expansions that fit learned distribution, enhancing retention and adaptability. To further minimize forgetting, freezing is applied by calculating the sparse mask, allowing data-driven preservation of important parameters. Through experiments across datasets with various settings, cases and task numbers, we demonstrate the necessity of layer expansion and showcase the effectiveness of SparseGrow in overcoming GIFt, highlighting its adaptability and knowledge retention for incremental tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Scaffold Prompt Tuning (ScaPT), a novel prompt-based framework for adapting large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pre-trained models to downstream tasks, with high parameter efficiency and improved performance compared to fine-tuning and baselines for prompt tuning. The full fine-tuning updates all pre-trained parameters, which may distort the learned feature space and lead to overfitting with limited training data which is common in fMRI fields. In contrast, we design a hierarchical prompt structure that transfers the knowledge learned from high-resource tasks to low-resource ones. This structure, equipped with a Deeply-conditioned Input-Prompt (DIP) mapping module, allows for efficient adaptation by updating only 2% of the trainable parameters. The framework enhances semantic interpretability through attention mechanisms between inputs and prompts, and it clusters prompts in the latent space in alignment with prior knowledge. Experiments on public resting state fMRI datasets reveal ScaPT outperforms fine-tuning and multitask-based prompt tuning in neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis/prognosis and personality trait prediction, even with fewer than 20 participants. It highlights ScaPT's efficiency in adapting pre-trained fMRI models to low-resource tasks.</p>

However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy breaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches primarily center around using prompt-specific methods to generate adversarial examples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods is hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts. In this paper, we introduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for customized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a Laplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by maximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution. This approach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved defense stability. Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style protection, demonstrate the superior generalization of our method in comparison to existing techniques.</p>

Whilst the proposed CNN architecture is demonstrated to achieve more than 99% accuracy for the test dataset, the computational procedure of CNN remains a black box. The visualisation based on Grad-CAM is attempted to explain such very high accuracy and may provide useful information for physicians. Future motivation based on this work is discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Chen, Bowen Wang, Zhouqiang jiang, Yuta Nakashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA). However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxin Tang, Siyuan Tang, Jian Zhang, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Breast ultrasound is prominently used in diagnosing breast tumors. At present, many automatic systems based on deep learning have been developed to help radiologists in diagnosis. However, training such systems remains challenging because they are usually data-hungry and demand amounts of labeled data, which need professional knowledge and are expensive. Methods: We adopted a triplet network and a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to learn representations from unlabeled breast ultrasound video clips. We further designed a new hard triplet loss to to learn representations that particularly discriminate positive and negative image pairs that are hard to recognize. We also constructed a pretraining dataset from breast ultrasound videos (1,360 videos from 200 patients), which includes an anchor sample dataset with 11,805 images, a positive sample dataset with 188,880 images, and a negative sample dataset dynamically generated from video clips. Further, we constructed a finetuning dataset, including 400 images from 66 patients. We transferred the pretrained network to a downstream benign/malignant classification task and compared the performance with other state-of-the-art models, including three models pretrained on ImageNet and a previous contrastive learning model retrained on our datasets. Results and conclusion: Experiments revealed that our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.952, which is significantly higher than the others. Further, we assessed the dependence of our pretrained model on the number of labeled data and revealed that <100 samples were required to achieve an AUC of 0.901. The proposed framework greatly reduces the demand for labeled data and holds potential for use in automatic breast ultrasound image diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Cheng, Xingming Chen, Jinxin Liang, Xiaoyu Tang, Xieyuanli Chen, Dachuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively summarizing dense 3D point cloud data and extracting motion information of moving objects (moving object segmentation, MOS) is crucial to autonomous driving and robotics applications. How to effectively utilize motion and semantic features and avoid information loss during 3D-to-2D projection is still a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view MOS model (MV-MOS) by fusing motion-semantic features from different 2D representations of point clouds. To effectively exploit complementary information, the motion branches of the proposed model combines motion features from both bird's eye view (BEV) and range view (RV) representations. In addition, a semantic branch is introduced to provide supplementary semantic features of moving objects. Finally, a Mamba module is utilized to fuse the semantic features with motion features and provide effective guidance for the motion branches. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed multi-branch fusion MOS framework via comprehensive experiments, and our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritwik Mishra, Sreeram Vennam, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing Question Answering Datasets (QuADs) primarily focus on factoid-based short-context Question Answering (QA) in high-resource languages. However, the scope of such datasets for low-resource languages remains limited, with only a few works centered on factoid-based QuADs and none on non-factoid QuADs. Therefore, this work presents MuNfQuAD, a multilingual QuAD with non-factoid questions. It utilizes interrogative sub-headings from BBC news articles as questions and the corresponding paragraphs as silver answers. The dataset comprises over 370K QA pairs across 38 languages, encompassing several low-resource languages, and stands as the largest multilingual QA dataset to date. Based on the manual annotations of 790 QA-pairs from MuNfQuAD (golden set), we observe that 98\% of questions can be answered using their corresponding silver answer. Our fine-tuned Answer Paragraph Selection (APS) model outperforms the baselines. The APS model attained an accuracy of 80\% and 72\%, as well as a macro F1 of 72\% and 66\%, on the MuNfQuAD testset and the golden set, respectively. Furthermore, the APS model effectively generalizes certain a language within the golden set, even after being fine-tuned on silver labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Ding, Shaobin Zhuang, Kunchang Li, Zhengrong Yue, Yu Qiao, Yali Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive text corpora, which inevitably include biased information. Although techniques such as Affective Alignment can mitigate some negative impacts of these biases, existing prompt-based attack methods can still extract these biases from the model's weights. Moreover, these biases frequently appear subtly when LLMs are prompted to perform identical tasks across different demographic groups, thereby camouflaging their presence. To address this issue, we have formally defined the implicit bias problem and developed an innovative framework for bias removal based on Bayesian theory, Bayesian-Theory based Bias Removal (BTBR). BTBR employs likelihood ratio screening to pinpoint data entries within publicly accessible biased datasets that represent biases inadvertently incorporated during the LLM training phase. It then automatically constructs relevant knowledge triples and expunges bias information from LLMs using model editing techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we have confirmed the presence of the implicit bias problem in LLMs and demonstrated the effectiveness of our BTBR approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhang, Xiuqi Zheng, Chenyi Liang, Jiani Hu, Weihong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: SOTA facial expression recognition (FER) methods fail on test sets that have domain gaps with the train set. Recent domain adaptation FER methods need to acquire labeled or unlabeled samples of target domains to fine-tune the FER model, which might be infeasible in real-world deployment. In this paper, we aim to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of FER methods on different unseen test sets using only one train set. Inspired by how humans first detect faces and then select expression features, we propose a novel FER pipeline to extract expression-related features from any given face images. Our method is based on the generalizable face features extracted by large models like CLIP. However, it is non-trivial to adapt the general features of CLIP for specific tasks like FER. To preserve the generalization ability of CLIP and the high precision of the FER model, we design a novel approach that learns sigmoid masks based on the fixed CLIP face features to extract expression features. To further improve the generalization ability on unseen test sets, we separate the channels of the learned masked features according to the expression classes to directly generate logits and avoid using the FC layer to reduce overfitting. We also introduce a channel-diverse loss to make the learned masks separated. Extensive experiments on five different FER datasets verify that our method outperforms SOTA FER methods by large margins. Code is available in https://github.com/zyh-uaiaaaa/Generalizable-FER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junming Wang, Dong Huang, Xiuxian Guan, Zekai Sun, Tianxiang Shen, Fangming Liu, Heming Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Air-ground robots (AGRs) are widely used in surveillance and disaster response due to their exceptional mobility and versatility (i.e., flying and driving). Current AGR navigation systems perform well in static occlusion-prone environments (e.g., indoors) by using 3D semantic occupancy networks to predict occlusions for complete local mapping and then computing Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) for path planning. However, these systems face challenges in dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in perception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba with an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba adopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction into independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these branches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in 3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn long-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and geometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to minimise computational overhead during feature fusion. The resulting semantic occupancy map is then seamlessly integrated into the local map, providing occlusion awareness of the dynamic environment. Our AGR-Planner utilizes this local map and employs kinodynamic A* search and gradient-based trajectory optimization to guarantee planning is ESDF-free and energy-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D semantic occupancy network with 25.0% mIoU. End-to-end navigation experiments in dynamic scenes verify OMEGA's efficiency, achieving a 96% average planning success rate. Code and video are available at https://jmwang0117.github.io/OMEGA/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Change detection is a crucial task in remote sensing, enabling the monitoring of environmental changes, urban growth, and disaster impact. Conventional change detection techniques, such as image differencing and ratioing, often struggle with noise and fail to capture complex variations in imagery. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly generative models like diffusion models, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the strengths of Stable Diffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to create robust and interpretable change maps. Our approach, named Diffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world remote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing techniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios with complex changes and noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonggan Wu, Ling-Chao Meng, Yuan Zichao, Sixian Chan, Hong-Qiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: For the visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) task, one of the primary challenges lies in significant cross-modality discrepancy. Existing methods struggle to conduct modality-invariant information mining. They often focus solely on mining singular dimensions like spatial or channel, and overlook the extraction of specific-modality multi-dimension information. To fully mine modality-invariant information across a wide range, we introduce the Wide-Ranging Information Mining Network (WRIM-Net), which mainly comprises a Multi-dimension Interactive Information Mining (MIIM) module and an Auxiliary-Information-based Contrastive Learning (AICL) approach. Empowered by the proposed Global Region Interaction (GRI), MIIM comprehensively mines non-local spatial and channel information through intra-dimension interaction. Moreover, Thanks to the low computational complexity design, separate MIIM can be positioned in shallow layers, enabling the network to better mine specific-modality multi-dimension information. AICL, by introducing the novel Cross-Modality Key-Instance Contrastive (CMKIC) loss, effectively guides the network in extracting modality-invariant information. We conduct extensive experiments not only on the well-known SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets but also on the latest large-scale cross-modality LLCM dataset. The results demonstrate WRIM-Net's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how models process and interpret time series data remains a significant challenge in deep learning to enable applicability in safety-critical areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we introduce Sequence Dreaming, a technique that adapts Activation Maximization to analyze sequential information, aiming to enhance the interpretability of neural networks operating on univariate time series. By leveraging this method, we visualize the temporal dynamics and patterns most influential in model decision-making processes. To counteract the generation of unrealistic or excessively noisy sequences, we enhance Sequence Dreaming with a range of regularization techniques, including exponential smoothing. This approach ensures the production of sequences that more accurately reflect the critical features identified by the neural network. Our approach is tested on a time series classification dataset encompassing applications in predictive maintenance. The results show that our proposed Sequence Dreaming approach demonstrates targeted activation maximization for different use cases so that either centered class or border activation maximization can be generated. The results underscore the versatility of Sequence Dreaming in uncovering salient temporal features learned by neural networks, thereby advancing model transparency and trustworthiness in decision-critical domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly in scale, leading to a critical need for efficient model pruning techniques. Existing post-training pruning techniques primarily focus on measuring weight importance on converged dense models to determine salient weights to retain. However, they often overlook the changes in weight importance during the pruning process, which can lead to performance degradation in the pruned models. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, ensuring global performance optimization. Inspired by the recent discovery of prominent outliers in LLMs, LLM-Barber introduces an innovative pruning metric that identifies weight importance using weights multiplied by gradients. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber can efficiently prune models like LLaMA and OPT families with 7B to 13B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection plays a key role in high-level visual understanding, facilitating a deep comprehension of human activities. Specifically, HOI detection aims to locate the humans and objects involved in interactions within images or videos and classify the specific interactions between them. The success of this task is influenced by several key factors, including the accurate localization of human and object instances, as well as the correct classification of object categories and interaction relationships. This paper systematically summarizes and discusses the recent work in image-based HOI detection. First, the mainstream datasets involved in HOI relationship detection are introduced. Furthermore, starting with two-stage methods and end-to-end one-stage detection approaches, this paper comprehensively discusses the current developments in image-based HOI detection, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods. Additionally, the advancements of zero-shot learning, weakly supervised learning, and the application of large-scale language models in HOI detection are discussed. Finally, the current challenges in HOI detection are outlined, and potential research directions and future trends are explored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxim Ifergan, Leshem Choshen, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Omri Abend</p>
<p>Abstract: The veracity of a factoid is largely independent of the language it is written in. However, language models are inconsistent in their ability to answer the same factual question across languages. This raises questions about how LLMs represent a given fact across languages. We explore multilingual factual knowledge through two aspects: the model's ability to answer a query consistently across languages, and the ability to ''store'' answers in a shared representation for several languages. We propose a methodology to measure the extent of representation sharing across languages by repurposing knowledge editing methods. We examine LLMs with various multilingual configurations using a new multilingual dataset. We reveal that high consistency does not necessarily imply shared representation, particularly for languages with different scripts. Moreover, we find that script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing. Finally, we observe that if LLMs could fully share knowledge across languages, their accuracy in their best-performing language could benefit an increase of up to 150\% on average. These findings highlight the need for improved multilingual knowledge representation in LLMs and suggest a path for the development of more robust and consistent multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in critical applications such as identity authentication and autonomous driving, where robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial. These attacks can exploit minor perturbations to cause significant prediction errors, making it essential to enhance the resilience of DNNs. Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model's parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) find extensive application across various scientific and engineering fields. While numerous models have emerged from both physics and machine learning (ML) communities, there is a growing trend towards integrating these approaches to develop hybrid architectures known as physics-aware machine learning models. Among these, the finite volume neural network (FINN) has emerged as a recent addition. FINN has proven to be particularly efficient in uncovering latent structures in data. In this study, we explore the capabilities of FINN in tackling the shallow-water equations, which simulates wave dynamics in coastal regions. Specifically, we investigate FINN's efficacy to reconstruct underwater topography based on these particular wave equations. Our findings reveal that FINN exhibits a remarkable capacity to infer topography solely from wave dynamics, distinguishing itself from both conventional ML and physics-aware ML models. Our results underscore the potential of FINN in advancing our understanding of spatiotemporal phenomena and enhancing parametrization capabilities in related domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most recent 3D instance segmentation methods are open vocabulary, offering a greater flexibility than closed-vocabulary methods. Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering ``List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating prevalence of encryption protocols has led to a concomitant surge in the number of malicious attacks that hide in encrypted traffic. Power grid systems, as fundamental infrastructure, are becoming prime targets for such attacks. Conventional methods for detecting malicious encrypted packets typically use a static pre-trained model. We observe that these methods are not well-suited for blockchain-based power grid systems. More critically, they fall short in dynamic environments where new types of encrypted attacks continuously emerge. Motivated by this, in this paper we try to tackle these challenges from two aspects: (1) We present a novel framework that is able to automatically detect malicious encrypted traffic in blockchain-based power grid systems and incrementally learn from new malicious traffic. (2) We mathematically derive incremental learning losses to resist the forgetting of old attack patterns while ensuring the model is capable of handling new encrypted attack patterns. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Bingzhe Wu, Yatao Bian, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang, Peilin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the quantum wave function amplitude represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST hand-written digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the stock price fluctuation pattern in S&P500. In (i) and (ii), strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and, in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbang Yuan, Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM have achieved success in many fields but still troubled by problematic content in the training corpora. LLM unlearning aims at reducing their influence and avoid undesirable behaviours. However, existing unlearning methods remain vulnerable to adversarial queries and the unlearned knowledge resurfaces after the manually designed attack queries. As part of a red-team effort to proactively assess the vulnerabilities of unlearned models, we design Dynamic Unlearning Attack (DUA), a dynamic and automated framework to attack these models and evaluate their robustness. It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple unlearning benchmarks and various models, and demonstrate that they improve the unlearning effectiveness by over $53.5\%$, cause only less than a $11.6\%$ reduction in neighboring knowledge, and have almost no impact on the model's general capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing ubiquity of relational data structured as graphs has underscored the need for graph learning models with exceptional generalization capabilities. However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from interpretation transition (LFIT) is a framework for learning rules from observed state transitions. LFIT has been implemented in purely symbolic algorithms, but they are unable to deal with noise or generalize to unobserved transitions. Rule extraction based neural network methods suffer from overfitting, while more general implementation that categorize rules suffer from combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a technique to leverage variable permutation invariance inherent in symbolic domains. Our technique ensures that the permutation and the naming of the variables would not affect the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of this method with various experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkun Wei, Shuo Cheng, Dayou Li, Ran Song, Yipeng Zhang, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently detecting target weld seams while ensuring sub-millimeter accuracy has always been an important challenge in autonomous welding, which has significant application in industrial practice. Previous works mostly focused on recognizing and localizing welding seams one by one, leading to inferior efficiency in modeling the workpiece. This paper proposes a novel framework capable of multiple weld seams extraction using both RGB images and 3D point clouds. The RGB image is used to obtain the region of interest by approximately localizing the weld seams, and the point cloud is used to achieve the fine-edge extraction of the weld seams within the region of interest using region growth. Our method is further accelerated by using a pre-trained deep learning model to ensure both efficiency and generalization ability. The performance of the proposed method has been comprehensively tested on various workpieces featuring both linear and curved weld seams and in physical experiment systems. The results showcase considerable potential for real-world industrial applications, emphasizing the method's efficiency and effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Padmanaba Srinivasan, William Knottenbelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms learn a dynamics model from collected data and apply it to generate synthetic trajectories to enable faster learning. This is an especially promising paradigm in offline reinforcement learning (RL) where data may be limited in quantity, in addition to being deficient in coverage and quality. Practical approaches to offline MBRL usually rely on ensembles of dynamics models to prevent exploitation of any individual model and to extract uncertainty estimates that penalize values in states far from the dataset support. Uncertainty estimates from ensembles can vary greatly in scale, making it challenging to generalize hyperparameters well across even similar tasks. In this paper, we present Morse Model-based offline RL (MoMo), which extends the anti-exploration paradigm found in offline model-free RL to the model-based space. We develop model-free and model-based variants of MoMo and show how the model-free version can be extended to detect and deal with out-of-distribution (OOD) states using explicit uncertainty estimation without the need for large ensembles. MoMo performs offline MBRL using an anti-exploration bonus to counteract value overestimation in combination with a policy constraint, as well as a truncation function to terminate synthetic rollouts that are excessively OOD. Experimentally, we find that both model-free and model-based MoMo perform well, and the latter outperforms prior model-based and model-free baselines on the majority of D4RL datasets tested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyang Qiu, Xinbei Ma, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions. Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors. This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects. In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM. By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness. Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data. Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks. This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style. We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for processing complex information in various fields, including science. The increasing amount of scientific literature allows these models to acquire and understand scientific knowledge effectively, thus improving their performance in a wide range of tasks. Due to the power of LLMs, they require extremely expensive computational resources, intense amounts of data, and training time. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have proposed various methodologies to make scientific LLMs more affordable. The most well-known approaches align in two directions. It can be either focusing on the size of the models or enhancing the quality of data. To date, a comprehensive review of these two families of methods has not yet been undertaken. In this paper, we (I) summarize the current advances in the emerging abilities of LLMs into more accessible AI solutions for science, and (II) investigate the challenges and opportunities of developing affordable solutions for scientific domains using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bei Ouyang, Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Tianyi Qian, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) is a promising distributed deep learning model training paradigm, but it has crucial security concerns arising from adversarial attacks. This research investigates and assesses the security of HFL using a novel methodology by focusing on its resilience against adversarial attacks inference-time and training-time. Through a series of extensive experiments across diverse datasets and attack scenarios, we uncover that HFL demonstrates robustness against untargeted training-time attacks due to its hierarchical structure. However, targeted attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, exploit this architecture, especially when malicious clients are positioned in the overlapping coverage areas of edge servers. Consequently, HFL shows a dual nature in its resilience, showcasing its capability to recover from attacks thanks to its hierarchical aggregation that strengthens its suitability for adversarial training, thereby reinforcing its resistance against inference-time attacks. These insights underscore the necessity for balanced security strategies in HFL systems, leveraging their inherent strengths while effectively mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Fahim Sikder, Resmi Ramachandranpillai, Daniel de Leng, Fredrik Heintz</p>
<p>Abstract: Data Fairness is a crucial topic due to the recent wide usage of AI powered applications. Most of the real-world data is filled with human or machine biases and when those data are being used to train AI models, there is a chance that the model will reflect the bias in the training data. Existing bias-mitigating generative methods based on GANs, Diffusion models need in-processing fairness objectives and fail to consider computational overhead while choosing computationally-heavy architectures, which may lead to high computational demands, instability and poor optimization performance. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we present a fair data generation technique based on knowledge distillation, where we use a small architecture to distill the fair representation in the latent space. The idea of fair latent space distillation enables more flexible and stable training of Fair Generative Models (FGMs). We first learn a syntax-agnostic (for any data type) fair representation of the data, followed by distillation in the latent space into a smaller model. After distillation, we use the distilled fair latent space to generate high-fidelity fair synthetic data. While distilling, we employ quality loss (for fair distillation) and utility loss (for data utility) to ensure that the fairness and data utility characteristics remain in the distilled latent space. Our approaches show a 5%, 5% and 10% rise in performance in fairness, synthetic sample quality and data utility, respectively, than the state-of-the-art fair generative model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Chen, Pengxu Wei, Guangqian Guo, Shan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods heavily rely on mask annotations, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. Existing weakly-supervised COD approaches exhibit significantly inferior performance compared to fully-supervised methods and struggle to simultaneously support all the existing types of camouflaged object labels, including scribbles, bounding boxes, and points. Even for Segment Anything Model (SAM), it is still problematic to handle the weakly-supervised COD and it typically encounters challenges of prompt compatibility of the scribble labels, extreme response, semantically erroneous response, and unstable feature representations, producing unsatisfactory results in camouflaged scenes. To mitigate these issues, we propose a unified COD framework in this paper, termed SAM-COD, which is capable of supporting arbitrary weakly-supervised labels. Our SAM-COD employs a prompt adapter to handle scribbles as prompts based on SAM. Meanwhile, we introduce response filter and semantic matcher modules to improve the quality of the masks obtained by SAM under COD prompts. To alleviate the negative impacts of inaccurate mask predictions, a new strategy of prompt-adaptive knowledge distillation is utilized to ensure a reliable feature representation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted extensive empirical experiments on three mainstream COD benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and even fully-supervised methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: While recent zero-shot multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. It was also observed that SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity, which enables straight-forward and robust voice cloning. In this study, we introduce SSL-TTS, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot TTS framework trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker. SSL-TTS leverages SSL features and retrieval methods for simple and robust zero-shot multi-speaker synthesis. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that require significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that SSL-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine control over the output speech by blending voices. Demo samples are available at https://idiap.github.io/ssl-tts</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Chen, Dian Shao, Guangqian Guo, Shan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) demands models to expeditiously and accurately distinguish objects which conceal themselves seamlessly in the environment. Owing to the subtle differences and ambiguous boundaries, COD is not only a remarkably challenging task for models but also for human annotators, requiring huge efforts to provide pixel-wise annotations. To alleviate the heavy annotation burden, we propose to fulfill this task with the help of only one point supervision. Specifically, by swiftly clicking on each object, we first adaptively expand the original point-based annotation to a reasonable hint area. Then, to avoid partial localization around discriminative parts, we propose an attention regulator to scatter model attention to the whole object through partially masking labeled regions. Moreover, to solve the unstable feature representation of camouflaged objects under only point-based annotation, we perform unsupervised contrastive learning based on differently augmented image pairs (e.g. changing color or doing translation). On three mainstream COD benchmarks, experimental results show that our model outperforms several weakly-supervised methods by a large margin across various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Lewen, Max Pargmann, Mehdi Cherti, Jenia Jitsev, Robert Pitz-Paal, Daniel Maldonado Quinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants play a crucial role in the global transition towards sustainable energy. A key factor in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of CSP plants is the distribution of concentrated flux density on the receiver. However, the non-ideal flux density generated by individual heliostats can undermine the safety and efficiency of the power plant. The flux density from each heliostat is influenced by its precise surface profile, which includes factors such as canting and mirror errors. Accurately measuring these surface profiles for a large number of heliostats in operation is a formidable challenge. Consequently, control systems often rely on the assumption of ideal surface conditions, which compromises both safety and operational efficiency. In this study, we introduce inverse Deep Learning Ray Tracing (iDLR), an innovative method designed to predict heliostat surfaces based solely on target images obtained during heliostat calibration. Our simulation-based investigation demonstrates that sufficient information regarding the heliostat surface is retained in the flux density distribution of a single heliostat, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict the underlying surface with deflectometry-like precision for the majority of heliostats. Additionally, we assess the limitations of this method, particularly in relation to surface accuracy and resultant flux density predictions. Furthermore, we are presenting a new comprehensive heliostat model using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) that has the potential to become the new State of the Art for heliostat surface parameterization. Our findings reveal that iDLR has significant potential to enhance CSP plant operations, potentially increasing the overall efficiency and energy output of the power plants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing work on pitch and timbre disentanglement has been mostly focused on single-instrument music audio, excluding the cases where multiple instruments are presented. To fill the gap, we propose DisMix, a generative framework in which the pitch and timbre representations act as modular building blocks for constructing the melody and instrument of a source, and the collection of which forms a set of per-instrument latent representations underlying the observed mixture. By manipulating the representations, our model samples mixtures with novel combinations of pitch and timbre of the constituent instruments. We can jointly learn the disentangled pitch-timbre representations and a latent diffusion transformer that reconstructs the mixture conditioned on the set of source-level representations. We evaluate the model using both a simple dataset of isolated chords and a realistic four-part chorales in the style of J.S.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Zhong, Fei Cheng, Qianying Liu, Junfeng Jiang, Zhen Wan, Chenhui Chu, Yugo Murawaki, Sadao Kurohashi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate whether non-English-centric LLMs, despite their strong performance, `think' in their respective dominant language: more precisely, `think' refers to how the representations of intermediate layers, when un-embedded into the vocabulary space, exhibit higher probabilities for certain dominant languages during generation. We term such languages as internal $\textbf{latent languages}$.
  We examine the latent language of three typical categories of models for Japanese processing: Llama2, an English-centric model; Swallow, an English-centric model with continued pre-training in Japanese; and LLM-jp, a model pre-trained on balanced English and Japanese corpora. Our empirical findings reveal that, unlike Llama2 which relies exclusively on English as the internal latent language, Japanese-specific Swallow and LLM-jp employ both Japanese and English, exhibiting dual internal latent languages. For any given target language, the model preferentially activates the latent language most closely related to it. In addition, we explore how intermediate layers respond to questions involving cultural conflicts between latent internal and target output languages. We further explore how the language identity shifts across layers while keeping consistent semantic meaning reflected in the intermediate layer representations.
  This study deepens the understanding of non-English-centric large language models, highlighting the intricate dynamics of language representation within their intermediate layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yang, Jiahao Zhu, Jianping Man, Li Fang, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to identify missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG). This is typically achieved through tasks such as link prediction and instance completion. However, these methods often focus on either static knowledge graphs (SKGs) or temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), addressing only within-scope triples. This paper introduces a new generative completion framework called Generative Subgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC). GS-KGC employs a question-answering format to directly generate target entities, addressing the challenge of questions having multiple possible answers. We propose a strategy that extracts subgraphs centered on entities and relationships within the KG, from which negative samples and neighborhood information are separately obtained to address the one-to-many problem. Our method generates negative samples using known facts to facilitate the discovery of new information. Furthermore, we collect and refine neighborhood path data of known entities, providing contextual information to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our experiments evaluated the proposed method on four SKGs and two TKGs, achieving state-of-the-art Hits@1 metrics on five datasets. Analysis of the results shows that GS-KGC can discover new triples within existing KGs and generate new facts beyond the closed KG, effectively bridging the gap between closed-world and open-world KGC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elia Bonetto, Aamir Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is increasingly being used to address the lack of labeled images in uncommon domains for deep learning tasks. A prominent example is 2D pose estimation of animals, particularly wild species like zebras, for which collecting real-world data is complex and impractical. However, many approaches still require real images, consistency and style constraints, sophisticated animal models, and/or powerful pre-trained networks to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Moreover, they often assume that the animal can be reliably detected in images or videos, a hypothesis that often does not hold, e.g. in wildlife scenarios or aerial images. To solve this, we use synthetic data generated with a 3D photorealistic simulator to obtain the first synthetic dataset that can be used for both detection and 2D pose estimation of zebras without applying any of the aforementioned bridging strategies. Unlike previous works, we extensively train and benchmark our detection and 2D pose estimation models on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets using both pre-trained and non-pre-trained backbones. These experiments show how the models trained from scratch and only with synthetic data can consistently generalize to real-world images of zebras in both tasks. Moreover, we show it is possible to easily generalize those same models to 2D pose estimation of horses with a minimal amount of real-world images to account for the domain transfer.

<p>Abstract: Early detection of wildfires is essential to prevent large-scale fires resulting in extensive environmental, structural, and societal damage. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can cover large remote areas effectively with quick deployment requiring minimal infrastructure and equipping them with small cameras and computers enables autonomous real-time detection. In remote areas, however, the UAVs are limited to on-board computing for detection due to the lack of high-bandwidth mobile networks. This limits the detection to methods which are light enough for the on-board computer alone. For accurate camera-based localisation, segmentation of the detected smoke is essential but training data for deep learning-based wildfire smoke segmentation is limited. This study shows how small specialised segmentation models can be trained using only bounding box labels, leveraging zero-shot foundation model supervision. The method offers the advantages of needing only fairly easily obtainable bounding box labels and requiring training solely for the smaller student network. The proposed method achieved 63.3% mIoU on a manually annotated and diverse wildfire dataset. The used model can perform in real-time at ~11 fps with a UAV-carried NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX computer while reliably recognising smoke, demonstrated at real-world forest burning events.

<p>Abstract: Extracting geometry features from photographic images independently of surface texture and transferring them onto different materials remains a complex challenge. In this study, we introduce Harmonizing Attention, a novel training-free approach that leverages diffusion models for texture-aware geometry transfer. Our method employs a simple yet effective modification of self-attention layers, allowing the model to query information from multiple reference images within these layers. This mechanism is seamlessly integrated into the inversion process as Texture-aligning Attention and into the generation process as Geometry-aligning Attention. This dual-attention approach ensures the effective capture and transfer of material-independent geometry features while maintaining material-specific textural continuity, all without the need for model fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, Audio Language Models (ALMs) are rapidly advancing due to the developments in large language models and audio neural codecs. These ALMs have significantly lowered the barrier to creating deepfake audio, generating highly realistic and diverse types of deepfake audio, which pose severe threats to society. Consequently, effective audio deepfake detection technologies to detect ALM-based audio have become increasingly critical. This paper investigate the effectiveness of current countermeasure (CM) against ALM-based audio. Specifically, we collect 12 types of the latest ALM-based deepfake audio and utilizing the latest CMs to evaluate. Our findings reveal that the latest codec-trained CM can effectively detect ALM-based audio, achieving 0% equal error rate under most ALM test conditions, which exceeded our expectations. This indicates promising directions for future research in ALM-based deepfake audio detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zili Liu, Hao Chen, Lei Bai, Wenyuan Li, Wanli Ouyang, Zhengxia Zou, Zhenwei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of frequent extreme weather and global warming, obtaining precise, fine-grained near-surface weather forecasts is increasingly essential for human activities. Downscaling (DS), a crucial task in meteorological forecasting, enables the reconstruction of high-resolution meteorological states for target regions from global-scale forecast results. Previous downscaling methods, inspired by CNN and Transformer-based super-resolution models, lacked tailored designs for meteorology and encountered structural limitations. Notably, they failed to efficiently integrate topography, a crucial prior in the downscaling process. In this paper, we address these limitations by pioneering the selective state space model into the meteorological field downscaling and propose a novel model called MambaDS. This model enhances the utilization of multivariable correlations and topography information, unique challenges in the downscaling process while retaining the advantages of Mamba in long-range dependency modeling and linear computational complexity. Through extensive experiments in both China mainland and the continental United States (CONUS), we validated that our proposed MambaDS achieves state-of-the-art results in three different types of meteorological field downscaling settings. We will release the code subsequently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Ma, Zhengding Luo, Thanh Vinh Vo, Kuankuan Sima, Tze-Yun Leong</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward shaping is effective in addressing the sparse-reward challenge in reinforcement learning by providing immediate feedback through auxiliary informative rewards. Based on the reward shaping strategy, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework, that integrates a centralized reward agent (CRA) and multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA functions as a knowledge pool, which aims to distill knowledge from various tasks and distribute it to individual policy agents to improve learning efficiency. Specifically, the shaped rewards serve as a straightforward metric to encode knowledge. This framework not only enhances knowledge sharing across established tasks but also adapts to new tasks by transferring valuable reward signals. We validate the proposed method on both discrete and continuous domains, demonstrating its robustness in multi-task sparse-reward settings and its effective transferability to unseen tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiara Stuardi, Claudio Gheller, Franco Vazza, Andrea Botteon</p>
<p>Abstract: The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Road traffic crashes cause millions of deaths annually and have a significant economic impact, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper presents an approach using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for road safety assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a new task ,V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), with a real-world dataset. Our approach optimizes prompt engineering and evaluates advanced VLMs, including Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini. The models effectively examine attributes for road assessment. Using crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, our scalable solution influentially estimates road safety levels. In addition, this approach is designed for local stakeholders who lack resources, as it does not require training data. It offers a cost-effective and automated methods for global road safety assessments, potentially saving lives and reducing economic burdens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores whether labeling AI as "trustworthy" or "reliable" influences user perceptions and acceptance of automotive AI technologies. Using a one-way between-subjects design, the research involved 478 online participants who were presented with guidelines for either trustworthy or reliable AI. Participants then evaluated three vignette scenarios and completed a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model, which included variables such as perceived ease of use, human-like trust, and overall attitude. Although labeling AI as "trustworthy" did not significantly influence judgments on specific scenarios, it increased perceived ease of use and human-like trust, particularly benevolence. This suggests a positive impact on usability and an anthropomorphic effect on user perceptions. The study provides insights into how specific labels can influence attitudes toward AI technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Tingwei Chen, Zhijie Cai, Hang Li, Xiaoyang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'obert Csord\'as, Christopher Potts, Christopher D. Manning, Atticus Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: The Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) states that neural networks learn to encode concepts as directions in activation space, and a strong version of the LRH states that models learn only such encodings. In this paper, we present a counterexample to this strong LRH: when trained to repeat an input token sequence, gated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learn to represent the token at each position with a particular order of magnitude, rather than a direction. These representations have layered features that are impossible to locate in distinct linear subspaces. To show this, we train interventions to predict and manipulate tokens by learning the scaling factor corresponding to each sequence position. These interventions indicate that the smallest RNNs find only this magnitude-based solution, while larger RNNs have linear representations. These findings strongly indicate that interpretability research should not be confined by the LRH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangjun Noh, Baekryun Seong, Hoyoon Byun, Sungjin Song, Kyungwoo Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation. However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC. LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks. The source code is at https://github.com/ASDASDanonymous/Language-Based-Classifier-forOOVtasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linlin Hu, Ao Sun, Shijie Hao, Richang Hong, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, most low-light image enhancement methods only consider information from a single view, neglecting the correlation between cross-view information. Therefore, the enhancement results produced by these methods are often unsatisfactory. In this context, there have been efforts to develop methods specifically for low-light stereo image enhancement. These methods take into account the cross-view disparities and enable interaction between the left and right views, leading to improved performance. However, these methods still do not fully exploit the interaction between left and right view information. To address this issue, we propose a model called Toward Sufficient Dual-View Interaction for Low-light Stereo Image Enhancement (SDI-Net). The backbone structure of SDI-Net is two encoder-decoder pairs, which are used to learn the mapping function from low-light images to normal-light images. Among the encoders and the decoders, we design a module named Cross-View Sufficient Interaction Module (CSIM), aiming to fully exploit the correlations between the binocular views via the attention mechanism. The quantitative and visual results on public datasets validate the superiority of our method over other related methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in our model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current methods for low- and few-shot object detection have primarily focused on enhancing model performance for detecting objects. One common approach to achieve this is by combining model finetuning with data augmentation strategies. However, little attention has been given to the energy efficiency of these approaches in data-scarce regimes. This paper seeks to conduct a comprehensive empirical study that examines both model performance and energy efficiency of custom data augmentations and automated data augmentation selection strategies when combined with a lightweight object detector. The methods are evaluated in three different benchmark datasets in terms of their performance and energy consumption, and the Efficiency Factor is employed to gain insights into their effectiveness considering both performance and efficiency. Consequently, it is shown that in many cases, the performance gains of data augmentation strategies are overshadowed by their increased energy usage, necessitating the development of more energy efficient data augmentation strategies to address data scarcity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, JinYi Yoon, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.</p>

Specifically, we define an adversarial influence function to theoretically assess the adversarial impact of node perturbations, thereby reframing the GNN attack problem into the adversarial influence maximization problem. In our approach, we unify the selection of the target node and the construction of feature perturbations into a single optimization problem, ensuring a unique and consistent feature perturbation for each target node. We leverage a surrogate model to transform this problem into a solvable linear programming task, streamlining the optimization process. Moreover, we extend our method to accommodate label-oriented attacks, broadening its applicability. Thorough evaluations on five benchmark datasets across three popular models underscore the effectiveness of our method in both untargeted and label-oriented targeted attacks. Through comprehensive analysis and ablation studies, we demonstrate the practical value and efficacy inherent to our design choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dona Arabi, Jafar Bakhshaliyev, Ayse Coskuner, Kiran Madhusudhanan, Kami Serdar Uckardes</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is important for improving machine learning model performance when faced with limited real-world data. In time series forecasting (TSF), where accurate predictions are crucial in fields like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, traditional augmentation methods for classification tasks are insufficient to maintain temporal coherence. This research introduces two augmentation approaches using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to adjust frequency elements while preserving temporal dependencies in time series data. Our methods, Wavelet Masking (WaveMask) and Wavelet Mixing (WaveMix), are evaluated against established baselines across various forecasting horizons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct extensive experiments on multivariate time series using Discrete Wavelet Transform as an augmentation technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques achieve competitive results with previous methods. We also explore cold-start forecasting using downsampled training datasets, comparing outcomes to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Sobhan Goudarzi, Mostafa Sharifzadeh, Adrian Basarab, Hassan Rivaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound plane wave imaging is a cutting-edge technique that enables high frame-rate imaging. However, one challenge associated with high frame-rate ultrasound imaging is the high noise associated with them, hindering their wider adoption. Therefore, the development of a denoising method becomes imperative to augment the quality of plane wave images. Drawing inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), our proposed solution aims to enhance plane wave image quality. Specifically, the method considers the distinction between low-angle and high-angle compounding plane waves as noise and effectively eliminates it by adapting a DDPM to beamformed radiofrequency (RF) data. The method underwent training using only 400 simulated images. In addition, our approach employs natural image segmentation masks as intensity maps for the generated images, resulting in accurate denoising for various anatomy shapes. The proposed method was assessed across simulation, phantom, and in vivo images. The results of the evaluations indicate that our approach not only enhances image quality on simulated data but also demonstrates effectiveness on phantom and in vivo data in terms of image quality. Comparative analysis with other methods underscores the superiority of our proposed method across various evaluation metrics.

<p>Abstract: We study two-stage committee elections where voters have dynamic preferences over candidates; at each stage, a committee is chosen under a given voting rule. We are interested in identifying a winning committee for the second stage that overlaps as much as possible with the first-stage committee. We show a full complexity dichotomy for the class of Thiele rules: this problem is tractable for Approval Voting (AV) and hard for all other Thiele rules (including, in particular, Proportional Approval Voting and the Chamberlin-Courant rule). We extend this dichotomy to the greedy variants of Thiele rules. We also explore this problem from a parameterized complexity perspective for several natural parameters. We complement the theory with experimental analysis: e.g., we investigate the average number of changes in the committee as a function of changes in voters' preferences and the role of ties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsin Raza, Ahsan Adeel</p>
<p>Abstract: To date, most dendritic studies have predominantly focused on the apical zone of pyramidal two-point neurons (TPNs) receiving only feedback (FB) connections from higher perceptual layers and using them for learning. Recent cellular neurophysiology and computational neuroscience studies suggests that the apical input (context), coming from feedback and lateral connections, is multifaceted and far more diverse, with greater implications for ongoing learning and processing in the brain than previously realized. In addition to the FB, the apical tuft receives signals from neighboring cells of the same network as proximal (P) context, other parts of the brain as distal (D) context, and overall coherent information across the network as universal (U) context. The integrated context (C) amplifies and suppresses the transmission of coherent and conflicting feedforward (FF) signals, respectively. Specifically, we show that complex context-sensitive (CS)-TPNs flexibly integrate C moment-by-moment with the FF somatic current at the soma such that the somatic current is amplified when both feedforward (FF) and C are coherent; otherwise, it is attenuated. This generates the event only when the FF and C currents are coherent, which is then translated into a singlet or a burst based on the FB information. Spiking simulation results show that this flexible integration of somatic and contextual currents enables the propagation of more coherent signals (bursts), making learning faster with fewer neurons. Similar behavior is observed when this functioning is used in conventional artificial networks, where orders of magnitude fewer neurons are required to process vast amounts of heterogeneous real-world audio-visual (AV) data trained using backpropagation (BP). The computational findings presented here demonstrate the universality of CS-TPNs, suggesting a dendritic narrative that was previously overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmana Sadhu, Ali Pesaranghader, Yanan Chen, Dong Hoon Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to emergent capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized as language-based agents to perform a variety of tasks and make decisions with an increasing degree of autonomy. These autonomous agents can understand high-level instructions, interact with their environments, and execute complex tasks using a selection of tools available to them. As the capabilities of the agents expand, ensuring their safety and trustworthiness becomes more imperative. In this study, we introduce the Athena framework which leverages the concept of verbal contrastive learning where past safe and unsafe trajectories are used as in-context (contrastive) examples to guide the agent towards safety while fulfilling a given task. The framework also incorporates a critiquing mechanism to guide the agent to prevent risky actions at every step. Furthermore, due to the lack of existing benchmarks on the safety reasoning ability of LLM-based agents, we curate a set of 80 toolkits across 8 categories with 180 scenarios to provide a safety evaluation benchmark. Our experimental evaluation, with both closed- and open-source LLMs, indicates verbal contrastive learning and interaction-level critiquing improve the safety rate significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Satya Kapoor, Alex Gil, Anshul Mittal, Rutu Mulkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Qualitative data collection and analysis approaches, such as those employing interviews and focus groups, provide rich insights into customer attitudes, sentiment, and behavior. However, manually analyzing qualitative data requires extensive time and effort to identify relevant topics and thematic insights. This study proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing interview transcripts. The novelty of this work lies in strategizing the research inquiry as one that is augmented by an LLM that serves as a novice research assistant. This research explores the mental model of LLMs to serve as novice qualitative research assistants for researchers in the talent management space. A RAG-based LLM approach is extended to enable topic modeling of semi-structured interview data, showcasing the versatility of these models beyond their traditional use in information retrieval and search. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM-augmented RAG approach can successfully extract topics of interest, with significant coverage compared to manually generated topics from the same dataset. This establishes the viability of employing LLMs as novice qualitative research assistants. Additionally, the study recommends that researchers leveraging such models lean heavily on quality criteria used in traditional qualitative research to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of their approach. Finally, the paper presents key recommendations for industry practitioners seeking to reconcile the use of LLMs with established qualitative research paradigms, providing a roadmap for the effective integration of these powerful, albeit novice, AI tools in the analysis of qualitative datasets within talent</p>

<p>Abstract: It has been a long-standing research goal to endow robot hands with human-level dexterity. Bi-manual robot piano playing constitutes a task that combines challenges from dynamic tasks, such as generating fast while precise motions, with slower but contact-rich manipulation problems. Although reinforcement learning based approaches have shown promising results in single-task performance, these methods struggle in a multi-song setting. Our work aims to close this gap and, thereby, enable imitation learning approaches for robot piano playing at scale. To this end, we introduce the Robot Piano 1 Million (RP1M) dataset, containing bi-manual robot piano playing motion data of more than one million trajectories. We formulate finger placements as an optimal transport problem, thus, enabling automatic annotation of vast amounts of unlabeled songs. Benchmarking existing imitation learning approaches shows that such approaches reach state-of-the-art robot piano playing performance by leveraging RP1M.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, yet current applications face challenges. While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for trajectory summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion rate on Touchdown dataset. This work showcases the potential of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in complex navigation tasks, representing an advancement towards practical applications of MLLMs in embodied AI.

<p>Abstract: Self-supervision has the potential to transform reinforcement learning (RL), paralleling the breakthroughs it has enabled in other areas of machine learning. While self-supervised learning in other domains aims to find patterns in a fixed dataset, self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) agents discover new behaviors by learning from the goals achieved during unstructured interaction with the environment. However, these methods have failed to see similar success, both due to a lack of data from slow environments as well as a lack of stable algorithms. We take a step toward addressing both of these issues by releasing a high-performance codebase and benchmark JaxGCRL for self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to train agents for millions of environment steps in minutes on a single GPU. The key to this performance is a combination of GPU-accelerated environments and a stable, batched version of the contrastive reinforcement learning algorithm, based on an infoNCE objective, that effectively makes use of this increased data throughput. With this approach, we provide a foundation for future research in self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to quickly iterate on new ideas and evaluate them in a diverse set of challenging environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Pinckney, Christopher Batten, Mingjie Liu, Haoxing Ren, Brucek Khailany</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large-language models (LLMs) to digital hardware code generation is an emerging field. Most LLMs are primarily trained on natural language and software code. Hardware code, such as Verilog, represents only a small portion of the training data and few hardware benchmarks exist. To address this gap, the open-source VerilogEval benchmark was released in 2023, providing a consistent evaluation framework for LLMs on code completion tasks. It was tested on state-of-the-art models at the time including GPT-4. However, VerilogEval and other Verilog generation benchmarks lack failure analysis and, in present form, are not conducive to exploring prompting techniques. Also, since VerilogEval's release, both commercial and open-source models have seen continued development.
  In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite. We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation. We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks. We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL. We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate. However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task. A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose sorting patch representations across views as a novel self-supervised learning signal to improve pretrained representations. To this end, we introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model, relative to reference batches. Our method leverages a differentiable sorting method applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. We demonstrate that this method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establish several new state-of-the-art results: +5.5% and + 6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, and +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Weitk\"amper</p>
<p>Abstract: Dependencies on the relative frequency of a state in the domain are common when modelling probabilistic dependencies on relational data. For instance, the likelihood of a school closure during an epidemic might depend on the proportion of infected pupils exceeding a threshold. Often, rather than depending on discrete thresholds, dependencies are continuous: for instance, the likelihood of any one mosquito bite transmitting an illness depends on the proportion of carrier mosquitoes. Current approaches usually only consider probabilities over possible worlds rather than over domain elements themselves. An exception are the recently introduced lifted Bayesian networks for conditional probability logic, which express discrete dependencies on probabilistic data. We introduce functional lifted Bayesian networks, a formalism that explicitly incorporates continuous dependencies on relative frequencies into statistical relational artificial intelligence, and compare and contrast them with lifted Bayesian networks for conditional probability logic. Incorporating relative frequencies is not only beneficial to modelling; it also provides a more rigorous approach to learning problems where training and test or application domains have different sizes. To this end, we provide a representation of the asymptotic probability distributions induced by functional lifted Bayesian networks on domains of increasing sizes. Since that representation has well-understood scaling behaviour across domain sizes, it can be used to estimate parameters for a large domain consistently from randomly sampled subpopulations. Furthermore, we show that in parametric families of FLBN, convergence is uniform in the parameters, which ensures a meaningful dependence of the asymptotic probabilities on the parameters of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Weitk\"amper</p>
<p>Abstract: The behaviour of statistical relational representations across differently sized domains has become a focal area of research from both a modelling and a complexity viewpoint.Recently, projectivity of a family of distributions emerged as a key property, ensuring that marginal probabilities are independent of the domain size. However, the formalisation used currently assumes that the domain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion of projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to functors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity available for the large range of applications taking structured input. We transfer key known results on projective families of distributions to the new setting. This includes a characterisation of projective fragments in different statistical relational formalisms as well as a general representation theorem for projective families of distributions. Furthermore, we prove a correspondence between projectivity and distributions on countably infinite domains, which we use to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical relational representations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended notion of projectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call $\sigma$-projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in different modes while retaining projectivity.</p>

Here, incorporating Vision Transformers (ViTs) into AlphaZero is insufficient for chess mastery, mainly due to ViTs' computational limitations. The attempt to optimize their efficiency by combining MobileNet and NextViT outperformed AlphaZero by about 30 Elo. However, we propose a practical improvement that involves a simple change in the input representation and value loss functions. As a result, we achieve a significant performance boost of up to 180 Elo points beyond what is currently achievable with AlphaZero in chess. In addition to these improvements, our experimental results using the Integrated Gradient technique confirm the effectiveness of the newly introduced features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emre K{\i}c{\i}man, Robert Ness, Amit Sharma, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We conduct a "behavorial" study of LLMs to benchmark their capability in generating causal arguments. Across a wide range of tasks, we find that LLMs can generate text corresponding to correct causal arguments with high probability, surpassing the best-performing existing methods. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain) and event causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). We perform robustness checks across tasks and show that the capabilities cannot be explained by dataset memorization alone, especially since LLMs generalize to novel datasets that were created after the training cutoff date.
  That said, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes, and we discuss the kinds of errors that may be improved and what are the fundamental limits of LLM-based answers. Overall, by operating on the text metadata, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. As a result, LLMs may be used by human domain experts to save effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. Given that LLMs ignore the actual data, our results also point to a fruitful research direction of developing algorithms that combine LLMs with existing causal techniques.

<p>Abstract: Modeling irregularly-sampled time series (ISTS) is challenging because of missing values. Most existing methods focus on handling ISTS by converting irregularly sampled data into regularly sampled data via imputation. These models assume an underlying missing mechanism, which may lead to unwanted bias and sub-optimal performance. We present SLAN (Switch LSTM Aggregate Network), which utilizes a group of LSTMs to model ISTS without imputation, eliminating the assumption of any underlying process. It dynamically adapts its architecture on the fly based on the measured sensors using switches. SLAN exploits the irregularity information to explicitly capture each sensor's local summary and maintains a global summary state throughout the observational period. We demonstrate the efficacy of SLAN on two public datasets, namely, MIMIC-III, and Physionet 2012.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weighted gradual semantics provide an acceptability degree to each argument representing the strength of the argument, computed based on factors including background evidence for the argument, and taking into account interactions between this argument and others. We introduce four important problems linking gradual semantics and acceptability degrees. First, we reexamine the inverse problem, seeking to identify the argument weights of the argumentation framework which lead to a specific final acceptability degree. Second, we ask whether the function mapping between argument weights and acceptability degrees is injective or a homeomorphism onto its image. Third, we ask whether argument weights can be found when preferences, rather than acceptability degrees for arguments are considered. Fourth, we consider the topology of the space of valid acceptability degrees, asking whether "gaps" exist in this space. While different gradual semantics have been proposed in the literature, in this paper, we identify a large family of weighted gradual semantics, called abstract weighted based gradual semantics. These generalise many of the existing semantics while maintaining desirable properties such as convergence to a unique fixed point. We also show that a sub-family of the weighted gradual semantics, called abstract weighted (L^p,\lambda,\mu)-based gradual semantics and which include well-known semantics, solve all four of the aforementioned problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Slavom\'ir \v{S}vanc\'ar, Luk\'a\v{s} Chrpa, Filip Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Tom\'a\v{s} Balyo</p>
<p>Abstract: The global food delivery market provides many opportunities for AI-based services that can improve the efficiency of feeding the world. This paper presents the Cloud Kitchen platform as a decision-making tool for restaurants with food delivery and a simulator to evaluate the impact of the decisions. The platform contains a Technology-Specific Bridge (TSB) that provides an interface for communicating with restaurants or the simulator. TSB uses a planning domain model to represent decisions embedded in the Unified Planning Framework (UPF). Decision-making, which concerns allocating customers' orders to vehicles and deciding in which order the customers will be served (for each vehicle), is done via a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), an efficient tool for this problem. We show that decisions made by our platform can improve customer satisfaction by reducing the number of delayed deliveries using a real-world historical dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous STRIPS domain model acquisition approaches that learn from state traces start with the names and parameters of the actions to be learned. Therefore their only task is to deduce the preconditions and effects of the given actions. In this work, we explore learning in situations when the parameters of learned actions are not provided. We define two levels of trace quality based on which information is provided and present an algorithm for each. In one level (L1), the states in the traces are labeled with action names, so we can deduce the number and names of the actions, but we still need to work out the number and types of parameters. In the other level (L2), the states are additionally labeled with objects that constitute the parameters of the corresponding grounded actions. Here we still need to deduce the types of the parameters in the learned actions. We experimentally evaluate the proposed algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art learning tool FAMA on a large collection of IPC benchmarks. The evaluation shows that our new algorithms are faster, can handle larger inputs and provide better results in terms of learning action models more similar to reference models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Eric Austin, Anton Korikov, Armin Toroghi, Scott Sanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user's top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems. While large language models (LLMs) enable fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set. In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but cannot generate arbitrary NL queries or reason over content in NL item descriptions -- requiring users to express preferences via ratings or comparisons of unfamiliar items. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to actively elicit NL feedback to identify the best recommendation. Key challenges in generalizing BO to deal with natural language feedback include determining: (a) how to leverage LLMs to model the likelihood of NL preference feedback as a function of item utilities, and (b) how to design an acquisition function for NL BO that can elicit preferences in the infinite space of language. We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses: 1) Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain Bayesian preference beliefs, and 2) BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to steer LLM query generation. We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled simulations, finding that after 10 turns of dialogue, PEBOL can achieve an MRR@10 of up to 0.27 compared to the best monolithic LLM baseline's MRR@10 of 0.17, despite relying on earlier and smaller LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Liu, Chenchen Kuai, Haoxuan Ma, Xishun Liao, Brian Yueshuai He, Jiaqi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirabel Reid, Santosh S. Vempala</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) perform (and sometimes excel at) more and more complex cognitive tasks, a natural question is whether AI really understands. The study of understanding in LLMs is in its infancy, and the community has yet to incorporate well-trodden research in philosophy, psychology, and education. We initiate this, specifically focusing on understanding algorithms, and propose a hierarchy of levels of understanding. We use the hierarchy to design and conduct a study with human subjects (undergraduate and graduate students) as well as large language models (generations of GPT), revealing interesting similarities and differences. We expect that our rigorous criteria will be useful to keep track of AI's progress in such cognitive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Zichen Wu, Yutong Yang, Junzhao Zhang, Yunfang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various downstream tasks. However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is particularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box access. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency of LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based approach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and uncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the uncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing sampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty information to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP obviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in selecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the uncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical approach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Deng, Shiyao Wang, Song Lu, Yinfeng Li, Xinchen Luo, Yuanjun Liu, Peixing Xu, Guorui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art sequential recommendation models heavily rely on transformer's attention mechanism. However, the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self attention have limited its scalability for modeling users' long range behaviour sequences. To address this problem, we propose ELASTIC, an Efficient Linear Attention for SequenTial Interest Compression, requiring only linear time complexity and decoupling model capacity from computational cost. Specifically, ELASTIC introduces a fixed length interest experts with linear dispatcher attention mechanism which compresses the long-term behaviour sequences to a significantly more compact representation which reduces up to 90% GPU memory usage with x2.7 inference speed up. The proposed linear dispatcher attention mechanism significantly reduces the quadratic complexity and makes the model feasible for adequately modeling extremely long sequences. Moreover, in order to retain the capacity for modeling various user interests, ELASTIC initializes a vast learnable interest memory bank and sparsely retrieves compressed user's interests from the memory with a negligible computational overhead. The proposed interest memory retrieval technique significantly expands the cardinality of available interest space while keeping the same computational cost, thereby striking a trade-off between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed ELASTIC, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets and compare it with several strong sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin and also highlight the computational efficiency of ELASTIC when modeling long sequences. We will make our implementation code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel M. Harrison</p>
<p>Abstract: Random Number Generation Tasks (RNGTs) are used in psychology for examining how humans generate sequences devoid of predictable patterns. By adapting an existing human RNGT for an LLM-compatible environment, this preliminary study tests whether ChatGPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM) trained on human-generated text, exhibits human-like cognitive biases when generating random number sequences. Initial findings indicate that ChatGPT-3.5 more effectively avoids repetitive and sequential patterns compared to humans, with notably lower repeat frequencies and adjacent number frequencies. Continued research into different models, parameters, and prompting methodologies will deepen our understanding of how LLMs can more closely mimic human random generation behaviors, while also broadening their applications in cognitive and behavioral science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qiao, Linbin Han, Xiantong Zhen, Jia-Hong Gao, Zhen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: In light of the inherent entailment relations between images and text, hyperbolic point vector embeddings, leveraging the hierarchical modeling advantages of hyperbolic space, have been utilized for visual semantic representation learning. However, point vector embedding approaches fail to address the issue of semantic uncertainty, where an image may have multiple interpretations, and text may refer to different images, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in the medical domain. Therefor, we propose \textbf{HYDEN}, a novel hyperbolic density embedding based image-text representation learning approach tailored for specific medical domain data. This method integrates text-aware local features alongside global features from images, mapping image-text features to density features in hyperbolic space via using hyperbolic pseudo-Gaussian distributions. An encapsulation loss function is employed to model the partial order relations between image-text density distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the interpretability of our approach and its superior performance compared to the baseline methods across various zero-shot tasks and different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinchen Yang, Zejun Xie, Hua Wei, Desheng Zhang, Yu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban traffic is subject to disruptions that cause extended waiting time and safety issues at signalized intersections. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical investigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep learning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with reduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\%$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Yang, Thomas M. Moerland, Mike Preuss, Aske Plaat, Edward S. Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing paradigm for training intelligent agents, enabling policy acquisition from the agent's own autonomously acquired experience. However, the training process of RL is far from automatic, requiring extensive human effort to reset the agent and environments. To tackle the challenging reset-free setting, we first demonstrate the superiority of model-based (MB) RL methods in such setting, showing that a straightforward adaptation of MBRL can outperform all the prior state-of-the-art methods while requiring less supervision. We then identify limitations inherent to this direct extension and propose a solution called model-based reset-free (MoReFree) agent, which further enhances the performance. MoReFree adapts two key mechanisms, exploration and policy learning, to handle reset-free tasks by prioritizing task-relevant states. It exhibits superior data-efficiency across various reset-free tasks without access to environmental reward or demonstrations while significantly outperforming privileged baselines that require supervision. Our findings suggest model-based methods hold significant promise for reducing human effort in RL. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/morefree</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial time series modeling is crucial for understanding and predicting market behaviors but faces challenges such as non-linearity, non-stationarity, and high noise levels. Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce $\textbf{PLUTUS}$, a $\textbf{P}$re-trained $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{T}$ransformer-based model that $\textbf{U}$nveils regularities in financial time $\textbf{S}$eries. PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings. TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions. PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saef Ullah Miah, Junaida Sulaiman, Md. Imamul Islam, Md. Masuduzzaman, Molla Shahadat Hossain Lipu, Ramdhan Nugraha</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid is becoming increasingly important as the world moves towards a more sustainable energy future in line with SDG 7. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources can make it challenging to manage the power grid and ensure a stable supply of electricity, which is crucial for achieving SDG 9. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for predicting energy demand in a smart power grid, which can improve the integration of renewable energy sources by providing accurate predictions of energy demand. Our approach aligns with SDG 13 on climate action, enabling more efficient management of renewable energy resources. We use long short-term memory networks, well-suited for time series data, to capture complex patterns and dependencies in energy demand data. The proposed approach is evaluated using four historical short-term energy demand data datasets from different energy distribution companies, including American Electric Power, Commonwealth Edison, Dayton Power and Light, and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection. The proposed model is compared with three other state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms: Facebook Prophet, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The experimental results show that the proposed REDf model can accurately predict energy demand with a mean absolute error of 1.4%, indicating its potential to enhance the stability and efficiency of the power grid and contribute to achieving SDGs 7, 9, and 13. The proposed model also has the potential to manage the integration of renewable energy sources effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The inherent diversity of computation types within the deep neural network (DNN) models often requires a variety of specialized units in hardware processors, which limits computational efficiency, increasing both inference latency and power consumption, especially when the hardware processor needs to support and execute different neural networks. In this study, we introduce NeuralMatrix, which elastically transforms the computations of entire DNNs into linear matrix operations. This transformation allows seamless execution of various DNN models all with matrix operations and paves the way for running versatile DNN models with a single General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) accelerator.Extensive experiments with both CNN and transformer-based models demonstrate the potential of NeuralMatrix to accurately and efficiently execute a wide range of DNN models, achieving 2.17-38.72 times computation efficiency (i.e., throughput per power) compared to CPUs, GPUs, and SoC platforms. This level of efficiency is usually only attainable with the accelerator designed for a specific neural network.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Impossible Distillation, a novel framework for paraphrasing and sentence summarization, that distills a high-quality dataset and model from a low-quality teacher that itself cannot perform these tasks. Unlike prior works that rely on an extreme-scale teacher model (e.g., GPT3) or task-specific architecture, we hypothesize and verify the paraphrastic proximity intrinsic to pre-trained LMs (e.g., GPT2), where paraphrases occupy a proximal subspace in the LM distribution. By identifying and distilling generations from these subspaces, Impossible Distillation produces a high-quality dataset and model even from GPT2-scale LMs. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks spanning unconstrained / syntax-controlled paraphrase generation and sentence summarization. Our model with 770M parameters consistently outperforms strong baselines, including models distilled from ChatGPT, and sometimes, even ChatGPT itself. Also, we find that our distilled dataset from 1.5B LMs exhibits higher diversity and fidelity than up to 13 times larger datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xijie Huang, Zechun Liu, Shih-Yang Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a representative model compression method to reduce redundancy in weights and activations. However, most existing QAT methods require end-to-end training on the entire dataset, which suffers from long training time and high energy costs. In addition, the potential label noise in the training data undermines the robustness of QAT. We propose two metrics based on analysis of loss and gradient of quantized weights: error vector score and disagreement score, to quantify the importance of each sample during training. Guided by these two metrics, we proposed a quantization-aware Adaptive Coreset Selection (ACS) method to select the data for the current training epoch. We evaluate our method on various networks (ResNet-18, MobileNetV2, RetinaNet), datasets(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, COCO), and under different quantization settings. Specifically, our method can achieve an accuracy of 68.39\% of 4-bit quantized ResNet-18 on the ImageNet-1K dataset with only a 10\% subset, which has an absolute gain of 4.24\% compared to the baseline. Our method can also improve the robustness of QAT by removing noisy samples in the training set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized chatbot-based teaching assistants can be crucial in addressing increasing classroom sizes, especially where direct teacher presence is limited. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue, with increasing research exploring their educational utility. However, the challenge lies not only in establishing the efficacy of LLMs but also in discerning the nuances of interaction between learners and these models, which impact learners' engagement and results. We conducted a formative study in an undergraduate computer science classroom (N=145) and a controlled experiment on Prolific (N=356) to explore the impact of four pedagogically informed guidance strategies on the learners' performance, confidence and trust in LLMs. Direct LLM answers marginally improved performance, while refining student solutions fostered trust. Structured guidance reduced random queries as well as instances of students copy-pasting assignment questions to the LLM. Our work highlights the role that teachers can play in shaping LLM-supported learning environments.</p>

However, with downstream tasks generally unknown at training time, it is difficult to deduce a priori which attributes of the data are indeed "style" and can be safely discarded. To deal with this, current approaches try to retain some style information by tuning the degree of invariance to some particular task, such as ImageNet object classification. However, prior work has shown that such task-specific tuning can lead to significant performance degradation on other tasks that rely on the discarded style. To address this, we introduce a more principled approach that seeks to disentangle style features rather than discard them. The key idea is to add multiple style embedding spaces where: (i) each is invariant to all-but-one augmentation; and (ii) joint entropy is maximized. We formalize our structured data-augmentation procedure from a causal latent-variable-model perspective, and prove identifiability of both content and individual style variables. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan Yang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: With in-context learning ability, the performance of large language models can be significantly boosted when provided with appropriate context. However, existing in-context learning methods mainly rely on human-provided contexts, such as labeled examples and explicit instructions. Writing context by humans is labor-intensive on various tasks and limits the model to tasks manageable by humans. To overcome these limitations, we propose Automatic In-Context Learning framework that enables the model to autonomously generate examples and instructions for problem-solving. With experiments across various models and datasets, results show that model-generated contexts outperform human-annotated contexts, including Few-Shot and Few-Shot-CoT methods, and surpass existing self-generated context methods like Zero-CoT and Auto-CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Zhang, Gaochang Wu, Jing Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyou Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at \url{https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/UDASS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijun Liang, Van Hoang Minh Nguyen, Jinghan Jia, Ismail Alkhouri, Sijia Liu, Saiprasad Ravishankar</p>
<p>Abstract: As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghao Fu, Zhiqi Shen, Jing Jih Chin, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing and reconstructing visual stimuli from brain signals effectively advances the understanding of human visual system. However, the EEG signals are complex and contain significant noise. This leads to substantial limitations in existing works of visual stimuli reconstruction from EEG, such as difficulties in aligning EEG embeddings with the fine-grained semantic information and a heavy reliance on additional large self-collected dataset for training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called BrainVis. Firstly, we divide the EEG signals into various units and apply a self-supervised approach on them to obtain EEG time-domain features, in an attempt to ease the training difficulty. Additionally, we also propose to utilize the frequency-domain features to enhance the EEG representations. Then, we simultaneously align EEG time-frequency embeddings with the interpolation of the coarse and fine-grained semantics in the CLIP space, to highlight the primary visual components and reduce the cross-modal alignment difficulty. Finally, we adopt the cascaded diffusion models to reconstruct images. Using only 10\% training data of the previous work, our proposed BrainVis outperforms state of the arts in both semantic fidelity reconstruction and generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Wang, Haonan Bai, Jen-tse Huang, Yuxuan Wan, Youliang Yuan, Haoyi Qiu, Nanyun Peng, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the significant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key insight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter to evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human evaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection, which is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilong Lin, Jian Cui, Xiaojing Liao, XiaoFeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The underground exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious services (i.e., Malla) is witnessing an uptick, amplifying the cyber threat landscape and posing questions about the trustworthiness of LLM technologies. However, there has been little effort to understand this new cybercrime, in terms of its magnitude, impact, and techniques. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on 212 real-world Mallas, uncovering their proliferation in underground marketplaces and exposing their operational modalities. Our study discloses the Malla ecosystem, revealing its significant growth and impact on today's public LLM services. Through examining 212 Mallas, we uncovered eight backend LLMs used by Mallas, along with 182 prompts that circumvent the protective measures of public LLM APIs. We further demystify the tactics employed by Mallas, including the abuse of uncensored LLMs and the exploitation of public LLM APIs through jailbreak prompts. Our findings enable a better understanding of the real-world exploitation of LLMs by cybercriminals, offering insights into strategies to counteract this cybercrime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Ma, Senlin Luo, Yu-Ming Shang, Yifei Zhang, Zhengjun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have investigated the potential of leveraging pre-trained language models, such as CodeBERT, to enhance source code-related tasks. Previous methodologies have relied on CodeBERT's '[CLS]' token as the embedding representation of input sequences for task performance, necessitating additional neural network layers to enhance feature representation, which in turn increases computational expenses. These approaches have also failed to fully leverage the comprehensive knowledge inherent within the source code and its associated text, potentially limiting classification efficacy. We propose CodeClassPrompt, a text classification technique that harnesses prompt learning to extract rich knowledge associated with input sequences from pre-trained models, thereby eliminating the need for additional layers and lowering computational costs. By applying an attention mechanism, we synthesize multi-layered knowledge into task-specific features, enhancing classification accuracy. Our comprehensive experimentation across four distinct source code-related tasks reveals that CodeClassPrompt achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaibin Zhang, Yongting Zhang, Lijun Li, Hongzhi Gao, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Feng Zhao, Yu Qiao, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Ren, Qiya Yang, Yichun Wu, Wei Xu, Yalong Wang, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems are designed to meet users' needs by delivering tailored lists of items that align with their specific demands or interests. In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role by modeling the intra-list correlations among items. The key challenge of reranking lies in the exploration of optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research proposes a generator-evaluator learning paradigm, where the generator generates multiple feasible sequences and the evaluator picks out the best sequence based on the estimated listwise score. The generator is of vital importance, and generative models are well-suited for the generator function. Current generative models employ an autoregressive strategy for sequence generation. However, deploying autoregressive models in real-time industrial systems is challenging. To address these issues, we propose a Non-AutoRegressive generative model for reranking Recommendation (NAR4Rec) designed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To tackle challenges such as sparse training samples and dynamic candidates, we introduce a matching model. Considering the diverse nature of user feedback, we employ a sequence-level unlikelihood training objective to differentiate feasible sequences from unfeasible ones. Additionally, to overcome the lack of dependency modeling in non-autoregressive models regarding target items, we introduce contrastive decoding to capture correlations among these items. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of NAR4Rec over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Online A/B tests reveal that NAR4Rec significantly enhances the user experience. Furthermore, NAR4Rec has been fully deployed in a popular video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Asher, Swarnadeep Bhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite great performance on many tasks, language models (LMs) still struggle with reasoning, sometimes providing responses that cannot possibly be true because they stem from logical incoherence. We call such responses \textit{strong hallucinations} and prove that they follow from an LM's computation of its internal representations for logical operators and outputs from those representations. Focusing on negation, we provide a novel solution in which negation is treated not as another element of a latent representation, but as \textit{an operation over an LM's latent representations that constrains how they may evolve}. We show that our approach improves model performance in cloze prompting and natural language inference tasks with negation without requiring training on sparse negative data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) designed as a foundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangchen Liu, Kuan Fang, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-world generalization requires robotic systems to have a profound understanding of the physical world and the user command to solve diverse and complex tasks. While the recent advancement in vision-language models (VLMs) has offered unprecedented opportunities to solve open-world problems, how to leverage their capabilities to control robots remains a grand challenge. In this paper, we present MOKA (Marking Open-vocabulary Keypoint Affordances), an approach that employs VLMs to solve robotic manipulation tasks specified by free-form language instructions. Central to our approach is a compact point-based representation of affordance, which bridges the VLM's predictions on observed images and the robot's actions in the physical world. By prompting the pre-trained VLM, our approach utilizes the VLM's commonsense knowledge and concept understanding acquired from broad data sources to predict affordances and generate motions. To facilitate the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot and few-shot manners, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks on images, converting affordance reasoning into a series of visual question-answering problems that are solvable by the VLM. We further explore methods to enhance performance with robot experiences collected by MOKA through in-context learning and policy distillation. We evaluate and analyze MOKA's performance on various table-top manipulation tasks including tool use, deformable body manipulation, and object rearrangement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Image composition involves seamlessly integrating given objects into a specific visual context. Current training-free methods rely on composing attention weights from several samplers to guide the generator. However, since these weights are derived from disparate contexts, their combination leads to coherence confusion and loss of appearance information. These issues worsen with their excessive focus on background generation, even when unnecessary in this task. This not only impedes their swift implementation but also compromises foreground generation quality. Moreover, these methods introduce unwanted artifacts in the transition area. In this paper, we formulate image composition as a subject-based local editing task, solely focusing on foreground generation. At each step, the edited foreground is combined with the noisy background to maintain scene consistency. To address the remaining issues, we propose PrimeComposer, a faster training-free diffuser that composites the images by well-designed attention steering across different noise levels. This steering is predominantly achieved by our Correlation Diffuser, utilizing its self-attention layers at each step. Within these layers, the synthesized subject interacts with both the referenced object and background, capturing intricate details and coherent relationships. This prior information is encoded into the attention weights, which are then integrated into the self-attention layers of the generator to guide the synthesis process. Besides, we introduce a Region-constrained Cross-Attention to confine the impact of specific subject-related tokens to desired regions, addressing the unwanted artifacts shown in the prior method thereby further improving the coherence in the transition area. Our method exhibits the fastest inference efficiency and extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning to defer (L2D) aims to improve human-AI collaboration systems by learning how to defer decisions to humans when they are more likely to be correct than an ML classifier. Existing research in L2D overlooks key real-world aspects that impede its practical adoption, namely: i) neglecting cost-sensitive scenarios, where type I and type II errors have different costs; ii) requiring concurrent human predictions for every instance of the training dataset; and iii) not dealing with human work-capacity constraints. To address these issues, we propose the \textit{deferral under cost and capacity constraints framework} (DeCCaF). DeCCaF is a novel L2D approach, employing supervised learning to model the probability of human error under less restrictive data requirements (only one expert prediction per instance) and using constraint programming to globally minimize the error cost, subject to workload limitations. We test DeCCaF in a series of cost-sensitive fraud detection scenarios with different teams of 9 synthetic fraud analysts, with individual work-capacity constraints. The results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than the baselines in a wide array of scenarios, achieving an average $8.4\%$ reduction in the misclassification cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunsuke Minusa, Tadayuki Matsumura, Kanako Esaki, Yang Shao, Chihiro Yoshimura, Hiroyuki Mizuno</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-report measures (e.g., Likert scales) are widely used to evaluate subjective health perceptions. Recently, the visual analog scale (VAS), a slider-based scale, has become popular owing to its ability to precisely and easily assess how people feel. These data can be influenced by the response style (RS), a user-dependent systematic tendency that occurs regardless of questionnaire instructions. Despite its importance, especially in between-individual analysis, little attention has been paid to handling the RS in the VAS (denoted as response profile (RP)), as it is mainly used for within-individual monitoring and is less affected by RP. However, VAS measurements often require repeated self-reports of the same questionnaire items, making it difficult to apply conventional methods on a Likert scale. In this study, we developed a novel RP characterization method for various types of repeatedly measured VAS data. This approach involves the modeling of RP as distributional parameters ${\theta}$ through a mixture of RS-like distributions, and addressing the issue of unbalanced data through bootstrap sampling for treating repeated measures. We assessed the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulated pseudo-data and an actual dataset from an empirical study. The assessment of parameter recovery showed that our method accurately estimated the RP parameter ${\theta}$, demonstrating its robustness. Moreover, applying our method to an actual VAS dataset revealed the presence of individual RP heterogeneity, even in repeated VAS measurements, similar to the findings of the Likert scale. Our proposed method enables RP heterogeneity-aware VAS data analysis, similar to Likert-scale data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehun Jung, Ximing Lu, Liwei Jiang, Faeze Brahman, Peter West, Pang Wei Koh, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The current winning recipe for automatic summarization is using proprietary large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning from them as teacher models. While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer. We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references. To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luxi He, Mengzhou Xia, Peter Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs), even those tuned for safety and alignment, are susceptible to jailbreaking. Some have found that just further fine-tuning an aligned model with benign data (i.e., data without harmful content) surprisingly leads to substantial degradation in safety. We delve into the data-centric aspects of why benign fine-tuning inadvertently contributes to jailbreaking. First, we represent fine-tuning data through two lenses: representation and gradient spaces. Additionally, we propose a bi-directional anchoring method that, during the selection process, prioritizes data points that are close to harmful examples and far from benign ones. Our approach effectively identifies subsets of benign data that are more likely to degrade the model's safety after fine-tuning. Training on just 100 of these seemingly benign datapoints surprisingly leads to the fine-tuned model affirmatively responding to >70% of tested harmful requests, compared to <20% after fine-tuning on randomly selected data. We also observe that the selected data frequently appear as lists, bullet points, or math questions, indicating a systematic pattern in fine-tuning data that contributes to jailbreaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Bordt, Harsha Nori, Vanessa Rodrigues, Besmira Nushi, Rich Caruana</p>
<p>Abstract: While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor-Alexandru Darvariu, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are a natural representation for systems based on relations between connected entities. Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise when considering an objective function related to a process of interest on discrete structures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solution space. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exact algorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-making strategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science, and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields, these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out to synthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph Reinforcement Learning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graph problems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review works along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself under fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facing the field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, the present work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performant algorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able to provide efficient and effective solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Chengzhi Hu, Bolei Ma, Paul R\"ottger, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). One common way to evaluate the model response is to rank the candidate answers based on the log probability of the first token prediction. An alternative way is to examine the text output. Prior work has shown that first token probabilities lack robustness to changes in MCQ phrasing, and that first token probabilities do not match text answers for instruction-tuned models. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50\%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe. Our findings provide further evidence for the benefits of text answer evaluation over first token probability evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated world-wide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures. In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found here: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan An, Guang Hua, Zhiping Lin, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Box-free model watermarking is an emerging technique to safeguard the intellectual property of deep learning models, particularly those for low-level image processing tasks. Existing works have verified and improved its effectiveness in several aspects. However, in this paper, we reveal that box-free model watermarking is prone to removal attacks, even under the real-world threat model such that the protected model and the watermark extractor are in black boxes. Under this setting, we carry out three studies. 1) We develop an extractor-gradient-guided (EGG) remover and show its effectiveness when the extractor uses ReLU activation only. 2) More generally, for an unknown extractor, we leverage adversarial attacks and design the EGG remover based on the estimated gradients. 3) Under the most stringent condition that the extractor is inaccessible, we design a transferable remover based on a set of private proxy models. In all cases, the proposed removers can successfully remove embedded watermarks while preserving the quality of the processed images, and we also demonstrate that the EGG remover can even replace the watermarks. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed attacks, revealing the vulnerabilities of the existing box-free methods and calling for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanhao Li, Zhen Li, Chenchen Jing, Shuo Liu, Wenqi Shao, Yuwei Wu, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are ignorant of the up-to-date knowledge, such as LLaVA series, because they cannot be updated frequently due to the large amount of resources required, and therefore fail in many cases. For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the singer of the theme song for the new Detective Conan movie, which wasn't released until April 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date knowledge, dubbed SearchLVLMs. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4V by about 25% in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Li, Ruoyu Wang, Lijuan Liu, Jun Du, Yixuan Sun, Zilu Guo, Zhenrong Zhang, Yuan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) generation has gained prominence, offering an innovative approach to synthesizing musical content from textual descriptions. Achieving high accuracy and diversity in this generation process requires extensive, high-quality data, including both high-fidelity audio waveforms and detailed text descriptions, which often constitute only a small portion of available datasets. In open-source datasets, issues such as low-quality music waveforms, mislabeling, weak labeling, and unlabeled data significantly hinder the development of music generation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for high-quality music generation that incorporates a quality-aware training strategy, enabling generative models to discern the quality of input music waveforms during training. Leveraging the unique properties of musical signals, we first adapted and implemented a masked diffusion transformer (MDT) model for the TTM task, demonstrating its distinct capacity for quality control and enhanced musicality. Additionally, we address the issue of low-quality captions in TTM with a caption refinement data processing approach. Experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on MusicCaps and the Song-Describer Dataset. Our demo page can be accessed at https://qa-mdt.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Chen, Xu Tan, Sylwan Rahardja, Jiawei Yang, Susanto Rahardja</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based sequence models are extensively employed in Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks due to their effective sequential modeling capabilities. However, the ability of TSAD is limited by two key challenges: (i) the ability to model long-range dependency and (ii) the generalization issue in the presence of non-stationary data. To tackle these challenges, an anomaly detector that leverages the selective state space model known for its proficiency in capturing long-term dependencies across various domains is proposed. Additionally, a multi-stage detrending mechanism is introduced to mitigate the prominent trend component in non-stationary data to address the generalization issue. Extensive experiments conducted on realworld public datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods surpass all 12 compared baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki van Stein, Thomas B\"ack</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) is a demanding task that involves generating translations in real-time while continuously processing speech input. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in SimulST research, focusing on four major challenges. Firstly, the complexities associated with processing lengthy and continuous speech streams pose significant hurdles. Secondly, satisfying real-time requirements presents inherent difficulties due to the need for immediate translation output. Thirdly, striking a balance between translation quality and latency constraints remains a critical challenge. Finally, the scarcity of annotated data adds another layer of complexity to the task. Through our exploration of these challenges and the proposed solutions, we aim to provide valuable insights into the current landscape of SimulST research and suggest promising directions for future exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninghui Feng, Songning Lai, Fobao Zhou, Zhenxiao Yin, Hang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

<p>Abstract: We present SciRIFF (Scientific Resource for Instruction-Following and Finetuning), a dataset of 137K instruction-following demonstrations for 54 tasks covering five essential scientific literature understanding capabilities: information extraction, summarization, question answering, claim verification, and classification. SciRIFF demonstrations are notable for their long input contexts, detailed task specifications, and complex structured outputs. While instruction-following resources are available in specific domains such as clinical medicine and chemistry, SciRIFF is the first dataset focused on extracting and synthesizing information from research literature across a wide range of scientific fields. To demonstrate the utility of SciRIFF, we develop a sample-efficient strategy to adapt a general instruction-following model for science by performing additional finetuning on a mix of general-domain and SciRIFF demonstrations. In evaluations on nine held-out scientific tasks, our model -- called SciTulu -- improves over a strong LLM baseline by 28.1% and 6.5% at the 7B and 70B scales respectively, while maintaining general instruction-following performance within 2% of the baseline. We are optimistic that SciRIFF will facilitate the development and evaluation of LLMs to help researchers navigate the ever-growing body of scientific literature. We release our dataset, model checkpoints, and data processing and evaluation code to enable further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present FairX, an open-source Python-based benchmarking tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of models under the umbrella of fairness, utility, and eXplainability (XAI). FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-removal models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Jun Jeon, Benjamin Van Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: The staggering progress of machine learning in the past decade has been a sight to behold. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that these milestones were achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. However, alluding to Plato's Allegory of the cave, it is likely that the observations which form the field's notion of reality are but shadows representing fragments of that reality. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to answer what exists outside of the cave. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are very intuitive, general, and which will help form principles to guide future investigations. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner, which considers the fundamental limits of information. Throughout this work, we derive very general theoretical results and apply them to derive insights specific to settings ranging from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning. We conclude with a section dedicated to characterizing the performance of misspecified algorithms. These results are exciting and particularly relevant as we strive to overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jiang, Yimin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Ghaith Altarabichi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DropKAN (Dropout Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) a regularization method that prevents co-adaptation of activation function weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). DropKAN functions by embedding the drop mask directly within the KAN layer, randomly masking the outputs of some activations within the KANs' computation graph. We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs. We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable behavior in the feedforward pass. We carry an empirical study with real world Machine Learning datasets to validate our findings. Our results suggest that DropKAN is consistently a better alternative to using standard Dropout with KANs, and improves the generalization performance of KANs. Our implementation of DropKAN is available at: \url{https://github.com/Ghaith81/dropkan}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embedded devices with neural network accelerators offer great versatility for their users, reducing the need to use cloud-based services. At the same time, they introduce new security challenges in the area of hardware attacks, the most prominent being side-channel analysis (SCA). It was shown that SCA can recover model parameters with a high accuracy, posing a threat to entities that wish to keep their models confidential. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of quantized models implemented in OpenVINO, an embedded framework for deploying neural networks on embedded and Edge devices. We show that it is possible to recover model parameters with high precision, allowing the recovered model to perform very close to the original one. Our experiments on GoogleNet v1 show only a 1% difference in the Top 1 and a 0.64% difference in the Top 5 accuracies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Vavekanand, Kira Sam</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a recent model training paradigm in which client devices collaboratively train a model without ever aggregating their data. Crucially, this scheme offers users potential privacy and security benefits by only ever communicating updates to the model weights to a central server as opposed to traditional machine learning (ML) training which directly communicates and aggregates data. However, FL training suffers from statistical heterogeneity as clients may have differing local data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to this issue of heterogeneity given that they have consistently been shown to be able to learn on vast amounts of noisy data. While LLMs are a promising development for resolving the consistent issue of non-I.I.D. Clients in federated settings exacerbate two other bottlenecks in FL: limited local computing and expensive communication. This thesis aims to develop efficient training methods for LLMs in FL. To this end, we employ two critical techniques in enabling efficient training. First, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational load of local model training. Second, we communicate sparse updates throughout training to significantly cut down on communication costs. Taken together, our method reduces communication costs by up to 10x over vanilla LoRA and up to 5x over more complex sparse LoRA baselines while achieving greater utility. We emphasize the importance of carefully applying sparsity and picking effective rank and sparsity configurations for federated LLM training.</p>

The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Liu, Chunshu Wu, Shihui Cao, Mingkai Chen, James Chenhao Liang, Ang Li, Michael Huang, Chuang Ren, Dongfang Liu, Ying Nian Wu, Tong Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable energy is a crucial global challenge, and recent breakthroughs in nuclear fusion ignition underscore the potential of harnessing energy extracted from nuclear fusion in everyday life, thereby drawing significant attention to fusion ignition research, especially Laser-Plasma Interaction (LPI). Unfortunately, the complexity of LPI at ignition scale renders theory-based analysis nearly impossible -- instead, it has to rely heavily on Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, which is extremely computationally intensive, making it a major bottleneck in advancing fusion ignition. In response, this work introduces Diff-PIC, a novel paradigm that leverages conditional diffusion models as a computationally efficient alternative to PIC simulations for generating high-fidelity scientific data. Specifically, we design a distillation paradigm to distill the physical patterns captured by PIC simulations into diffusion models, demonstrating both theoretical and practical feasibility. Moreover, to ensure practical effectiveness, we provide solutions for two critical challenges: (1) We develop a physically-informed conditional diffusion model that can learn and generate meaningful embeddings for mathematically continuous physical conditions. This model offers algorithmic generalization and adaptable transferability, effectively capturing the complex relationships between physical conditions and simulation outcomes; and (2) We employ the rectified flow technique to make our model a one-step conditional diffusion model, enhancing its efficiency further while maintaining high fidelity and physical validity. Diff-PIC establishes a new paradigm for using diffusion models to overcome the computational barriers in nuclear fusion research, setting a benchmark for future innovations and advancements in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: WalledEval is a comprehensive AI safety testing toolkit designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs). It accommodates a diverse range of models, including both open-weight and API-based ones, and features over 35 safety benchmarks covering areas such as multilingual safety, exaggerated safety, and prompt injections. The framework supports both LLM and judge benchmarking and incorporates custom mutators to test safety against various text-style mutations, such as future tense and paraphrasing. Additionally, WalledEval introduces WalledGuard, a new, small, and performant content moderation tool, and two datasets: SGXSTest and HIXSTest, which serve as benchmarks for assessing the exaggerated safety of LLMs and judges in cultural contexts. We make WalledEval publicly available at https://github.com/walledai/walledeval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunhae Lee, Pat Pataranutaporn, Judith Amores, Pattie Maes</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates psychological factors influencing belief in AI predictions about personal behavior, comparing it to belief in astrology and personality-based predictions. Through an experiment with 238 participants, we examined how cognitive style, paranormal beliefs, AI attitudes, personality traits, and other factors affect perceived validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of predictions from different sources. Our findings reveal that belief in AI predictions is positively correlated with belief in predictions based on astrology and personality psychology. Notably, paranormal beliefs and positive AI attitudes significantly increased perceived validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of AI predictions. Conscientiousness was negatively correlated with belief in predictions across all sources, and interest in the prediction topic increased believability across predictions. Surprisingly, cognitive style did not significantly influence belief in predictions. These results highlight the "rational superstition" phenomenon in AI, where belief is driven more by mental heuristics and intuition than critical evaluation. We discuss implications for designing AI systems and communication strategies that foster appropriate trust and skepticism. This research contributes to our understanding of the psychology of human-AI interaction and offers insights for the design and deployment of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Liu, Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Shuling Yang, Hanzhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive relation prediction (IRP) -- where entities can be different during training and inference -- has shown great power for completing evolving knowledge graphs. Existing works mainly focus on using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the representation of the subgraph induced from the target link, which can be seen as an implicit rule-mining process to measure the plausibility of the target link. However, these methods cannot differentiate the target link and other links during message passing, hence the final subgraph representation will contain irrelevant rule information to the target link, which reduces the reasoning performance and severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \textit{single-source edge-wise} GNN model to learn the \textbf{R}ule-induc\textbf{E}d \textbf{S}ubgraph represen\textbf{T}ations (\textbf{REST}), which encodes relevant rules and eliminates irrelevant rules within the subgraph. Specifically, we propose a \textit{single-source} initialization approach to initialize edge features only for the target link, which guarantees the relevance of mined rules and target link. Then we propose several RNN-based functions for \textit{edge-wise} message passing to model the sequential property of mined rules. REST is a simple and effective approach with theoretical support to learn the \textit{rule-induced subgraph representation}. Moreover, REST does not need node labeling, which significantly accelerates the subgraph preprocessing time by up to \textbf{11.66$\times$}. Experiments on inductive relation prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our REST. Our code is available at https://github.com/smart-lty/REST.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seon-Hoon Kim, Dae-won Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anders Gj{\o}lbye, Lina Skerath, William Lehn-Schi{\o}ler, Nicolas Langer, Lars Kai Hansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) research typically focuses on tasks with narrowly defined objectives, but recent studies are expanding into the use of unlabeled data within larger models, aiming for a broader range of applications. This addresses a critical challenge in EEG research. For example, Kostas et al. (2021) show that self-supervised learning (SSL) outperforms traditional supervised methods. Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Jafarinia, Alireza Alipanah, Danial Hamdi, Saeed Razavi, Nahal Mirzaie, Mohammad Hossein Rohban</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08808">Constructing Domain-Specific Evaluation Sets for LLM-as-a-judge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Raju, Swayambhoo Jain, Bo Li, Jonathan Li, Urmish Thakker</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, yet current benchmarks often fall short in capturing the diverse behavior of these models in real-world applications. A benchmark's usefulness is determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varying capabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existing frameworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC \cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1 \cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queries and lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingual contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel data pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manual curation, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains and languages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14 categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models, and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. The agreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval 2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next best benchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of the benchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories, offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLM evaluation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyril Shih-Huan Hsu, Danny De Vleeschauwer, Chrysa Papagianni</p>
<p>Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple domains, each domain must uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. This requires decomposing the E2E SLA into partial SLAs for each domain. In a two-level network slicing management system with an E2E orchestrator and local controllers, we propose an online learning-decomposition framework that dynamically updates risk models using recent feedback. This approach utilizes online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers to enhance stability and robustness. Our empirical study shows the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art static methods, offering more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition under varying conditions and sparse data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sher Badshah, Hassan Sajjad</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chat assistants capable of generating human-like conversations has amplified the need for robust evaluation methods, particularly for open-ended tasks. Conventional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while useful, are increasingly inadequate for capturing the subtle semantics and contextual richness of such generative outputs. We propose a reference-guided verdict method that automates the evaluation process by leveraging multiple LLMs-as-judges. Through experiments on three open-ended question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that combining multiple LLMs-as-judges significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, particularly in complex tasks where a single model might struggle. Our findings reveal a strong correlation with human evaluations, establishing our method as a viable and effective alternative to traditional metrics and human judgments, particularly in the context of LLM-based chat assistants where the complexity and diversity of responses challenge existing benchmarks.</p>

By combining these complementary methods, the hybrid approach effectively captures both explicit and implicit user intent.The paper further explores techniques to optimize query execution for faster response times and demonstrates the effectiveness of this hybrid search model in producing comprehensive and accurate search outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anusree P. S., Bikram Keshari Parida, Seong Yong Moon, Wonsang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Panoramic X-rays are the most commonly used imaging modalities in dental health care. CBCT can produce three-dimensional views of a patient's head, providing clinicians with better diagnostic capability, whereas Panoramic X-ray can capture the entire maxillofacial region in a single image. If the CBCT is already available, it can be beneficial to synthesize a Panoramic X-ray, thereby avoiding an immediate additional scan and extra radiation exposure. Existing methods focus on delineating an approximate dental arch and creating orthogonal projections along this arch. However, no golden standard is available for such dental arch extractions, and this choice can affect the quality of synthesized X-rays. To avoid such issues, we propose a novel method for synthesizing Panoramic X-rays from diverse head CBCTs, employing a simulated projection geometry and dynamic rotation centers. Our method effectively synthesized panoramic views from CBCT, even for patients with missing or nonexistent teeth and in the presence of severe metal implants. Our results demonstrate that this method can generate high-quality panoramic images irrespective of the CBCT scanner geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Wang, Kaichen Zhou, Andrew Markham, Niki Trigoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Location information is pivotal for the automation and intelligence of terminal devices and edge-cloud IoT systems, such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. However, achieving reliable positioning across diverse IoT applications remains challenging due to significant training costs and the necessity of densely collected data. To tackle these issues, we have innovatively applied the selective state space (SSM) model to visual localization, introducing a new model named MambaLoc. The proposed model demonstrates exceptional training efficiency by capitalizing on the SSM model's strengths in efficient feature extraction, rapid computation, and memory optimization, and it further ensures robustness in sparse data environments due to its parameter sparsity. Additionally, we propose the Global Information Selector (GIS), which leverages selective SSM to implicitly achieve the efficient global feature extraction capabilities of Non-local Neural Networks. This design leverages the computational efficiency of the SSM model alongside the Non-local Neural Networks' capacity to capture long-range dependencies with minimal layers. Consequently, the GIS enables effective global information capture while significantly accelerating convergence. Our extensive experimental validation using public indoor and outdoor datasets first demonstrates our model's effectiveness, followed by evidence of its versatility with various existing localization models. Our code and models are publicly available to support further research and development in this area.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09698">Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Ye, Zhi Zheng, Yishan Shen, Tianshu Wang, Hengruo Zhang, Peijun Zhu, Runlong Yu, Kai Zhang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</p>
