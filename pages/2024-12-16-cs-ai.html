<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Xie, Yijun Pan, Hua Xu, Qiaozhu Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has proven to be a transformative tool for advancing scientific research across a wide range of disciplines. However, a significant gap still exists between AI and scientific communities, limiting the full potential of AI methods in driving broad scientific discovery. Existing efforts in bridging this gap have often relied on qualitative examination of small samples of literature, offering a limited perspective on the broader AI4Science landscape. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the AI4Science literature, starting by using large language models to identify scientific problems and AI methods in publications from top science and AI venues. Leveraging this new dataset, we quantitatively highlight key disparities between AI methods and scientific problems in this integrated space, revealing substantial opportunities for deeper AI integration across scientific disciplines. Furthermore, we explore the potential and challenges of facilitating collaboration between AI and scientific communities through the lens of link prediction. Our findings and tools aim to promote more impactful interdisciplinary collaborations and accelerate scientific discovery through deeper and broader AI integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Li, Zhaoliang Chen, Songyuan Liu, Yiming Lu, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of how large language models (LLMs) contribute to solving planning problems. In particular, we examine how LLMs perform when they are used as problem solver, solution verifier, and heuristic guidance to improve intermediate solutions. Our analysis reveals that although it is difficult for LLMs to generate correct plans out-of-the-box, LLMs are much better at providing feedback signals to intermediate/incomplete solutions in the form of comparative heuristic functions. This evaluation framework provides insights into how future work may design better LLM-based tree-search algorithms to solve diverse planning and reasoning problems. We also propose a novel benchmark to evaluate LLM's ability to learn user preferences on the fly, which has wide applications in practical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Schmidt, Frank Dreyer, Sayed Abid Hashimi, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic signal control plays a crucial role in urban mobility. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonghyuk Park, Alex Lascarides, Subramanian Ramamoorthy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we offer a learning framework in which the agent's knowledge gaps are overcome through corrective feedback from a teacher whenever the agent explains its (incorrect) predictions. We test it in a low-resource visual processing scenario, in which the agent must learn to recognize distinct types of toy truck. The agent starts the learning process with no ontology about what types of trucks exist nor which parts they have, and a deficient model for recognizing those parts from visual input. The teacher's feedback to the agent's explanations addresses its lack of relevant knowledge in the ontology via a generic rule (e.g., "dump trucks have dumpers"), whereas an inaccurate part recognition is corrected by a deictic statement (e.g., "this is not a dumper"). The learner utilizes this feedback not only to improve its estimate of the hypothesis space of possible domain ontologies and probability distributions over them, but also to use those estimates to update its visual interpretation of the scene. Our experiments demonstrate that teacher-learner pairs utilizing explanations and corrections are more data-efficient than those without such a faculty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Wang, Fangkai Yang, Chaoyun Zhang, Junting Lu, Jiaxu Qian, Shilin He, Pu Zhao, Bo Qiao, Ray Huang, Si Qin, Qisheng Su, Jiayi Ye, Yudi Zhang, Jian-Guang Lou, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go beyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of performing real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual responses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and execution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the potential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task completion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward artificial general intelligence.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs, offering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment. We begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics and delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as a case study, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of LAM development, including data collection, model training, environment integration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve as a blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains. We conclude by identifying the current limitations of LAMs and discussing directions for future research and industrial deployment, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in realizing the full potential of LAMs in real-world applications.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10185">Solving Robust Markov Decision Processes: Generic, Reliable, Efficient</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Meggendorfer, Maximilian Weininger, Patrick Wienh\"oft</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDP) are a well-established model for sequential decision-making in the presence of probabilities. In robust MDP (RMDP), every action is associated with an uncertainty set of probability distributions, modelling that transition probabilities are not known precisely. Based on the known theoretical connection to stochastic games, we provide a framework for solving RMDPs that is generic, reliable, and efficient. It is *generic* both with respect to the model, allowing for a wide range of uncertainty sets, including but not limited to intervals, $L^1$- or $L^2$-balls, and polytopes; and with respect to the objective, including long-run average reward, undiscounted total reward, and stochastic shortest path. It is *reliable*, as our approach not only converges in the limit, but provides precision guarantees at any time during the computation. It is *efficient* because -- in contrast to state-of-the-art approaches -- it avoids explicitly constructing the underlying stochastic game. Consequently, our prototype implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude and can solve RMDPs with a million states in under a minute.</p>

<p>Abstract: In industrial contexts, effective workforce allocation is crucial for operational efficiency. This paper presents an ongoing project focused on developing a decision-making tool designed for workforce allocation, emphasising the explainability to enhance its trustworthiness. Our objective is to create a system that not only optimises the allocation of teams to scheduled tasks but also provides clear, understandable explanations for its decisions, particularly in cases where the problem is infeasible. By incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms, the tool aims to enhance user trust and facilitate interactive conflict resolution. We implemented our approach on a prototype tool/digital demonstrator intended to be evaluated on a real industrial scenario both in terms of performance and user acceptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rainer Muehlhoff, Marte Henningsen</p>
<p>Abstract: [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Luo, Sean O'Connell, Shamima Mithun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of three state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized career mentoring in the computing field, using three distinct student profiles that consider gender, race, and professional levels. We evaluated the performance of GPT-4, LLaMA 3, and Palm 2 using a zero-shot learning approach without human intervention. A quantitative evaluation was conducted through a custom natural language processing analytics pipeline to highlight the uniqueness of the responses and to identify words reflecting each student's profile, including race, gender, or professional level. The analysis of frequently used words in the responses indicates that GPT-4 offers more personalized mentoring compared to the other two LLMs. Additionally, a qualitative evaluation was performed to see if human experts reached similar conclusions. The analysis of survey responses shows that GPT-4 outperformed the other two LLMs in delivering more accurate and useful mentoring while addressing specific challenges with encouragement languages. Our work establishes a foundation for developing personalized mentoring tools based on LLMs, incorporating human mentors in the process to deliver a more impactful and tailored mentoring experience.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632">Methods to Assess the UK Government&#x27;s Current Role as a Data Provider for AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Majithia, Elena Simperl</p>
<p>Abstract: The compositions of generative AI training corpora remain closely-guarded secrets, causing an asymmetry of information between AI developers and organisational data owners whose digital assets may have been incorporated into the corpora without their knowledge. While this asymmetry is the subject of well-known ongoing lawsuits, it also inhibits the measurement of the impact of open data sources for AI training. To address this, we introduce and implement two methods to assess open data usage for the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) and 'peek behind the curtain' in order to observe the UK government's current contributions as a data provider for AI. The first method, an ablation study that utilises LLM 'unlearning', seeks to examine the importance of the information held on UK government websites for LLMs and their performance in citizen query tasks. The second method, an information leakage study, seeks to ascertain whether LLMs are aware of the information held in the datasets published on the UK government's open data initiative data.gov.uk. Our findings indicate that UK government websites are important data sources for AI (heterogenously across subject matters) while data.gov.uk is not. This paper serves as a technical report, explaining in-depth the designs, mechanics, and limitations of the above experiments. It is accompanied by a complementary non-technical report on the ODI website in which we summarise the experiments and key findings, interpret them, and build a set of actionable recommendations for the UK government to take forward as it seeks to design AI policy. While we focus on UK open government data, we believe that the methods introduced in this paper present a reproducible approach to tackle the opaqueness of AI training corpora and provide organisations a framework to evaluate and maximize their contributions to AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kentaroh Toyoda, Xiao Wang, Mingzhe Li, Bo Gao, Yuan Wang, Qingsong Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Blockchain data analysis is essential for deriving insights, tracking transactions, identifying patterns, and ensuring the integrity and security of decentralized networks. It plays a key role in various areas, such as fraud detection, regulatory compliance, smart contract auditing, and decentralized finance (DeFi) risk management. However, existing blockchain data analysis tools face challenges, including data scarcity, the lack of generalizability, and the lack of reasoning capability.
  We believe large language models (LLMs) can mitigate these challenges; however, we have not seen papers discussing LLM integration in blockchain data analysis in a comprehensive and systematic way. This paper systematically explores potential techniques and design patterns in LLM-integrated blockchain data analysis. We also outline prospective research opportunities and challenges, emphasizing the need for further exploration in this promising field. This paper aims to benefit a diverse audience spanning academia, industry, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the integration of LLMs in blockchain data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcos Da Silveira, Louis Deladiennee, Kheira Acem, Oona Freudenthal</p>
<p>Abstract: Human health is increasingly threatened by exposure to hazardous substances, particularly persistent and toxic chemicals. The link between these substances, often encountered in complex mixtures, and various diseases are demonstrated in scientific studies. However, this information is scattered across several sources and hardly accessible by humans and machines. This paper evaluates current practices for publishing/accessing information on hazardous chemicals and proposes a novel platform designed to facilitate retrieval of critical chemical data in urgent situations. The platform aggregates information from multiple sources and organizes it into a structured knowledge graph. Users can access this information through a visual interface such as Neo4J Bloom and dashboards, or via natural language queries using a Chatbot. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the time and effort required to access vital chemical information when datasets follow FAIR principles. Furthermore, we discuss the lessons learned from the development and implementation of this platform and provide recommendations for data owners and publishers to enhance data reuse and interoperability. This work aims to improve the accessibility and usability of chemical information by healthcare professionals, thereby supporting better health outcomes and informed decision-making in the face of patients exposed to chemical intoxication risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Cardillo, Lucilla Frattura</p>
<p>Abstract: Coding morbidity data using international standard diagnostic classifications is increasingly important and still challenging. Clinical coders and physicians assign codes to patient episodes based on their interpretation of case notes or electronic patient records. Therefore, accurate coding relies on the legibility of case notes and the coders' understanding of medical terminology. During the last ten years, many studies have shown poor reproducibility of clinical coding, even recently, with the application of Artificial Intelligence-based models. Given this context, the paper aims to present the SISCO.web approach designed to support physicians in filling in Hospital Discharge Records with proper diagnoses and procedures codes using the International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th), and, above all, in identifying the main pathological condition. The web service leverages NLP algorithms, specific coding rules, as well as ad hoc decision trees to identify the main condition, showing promising results in providing accurate ICD coding suggestions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based image generation has undergone a paradigm shift since 2021, marked by fundamental architectural breakthroughs and computational innovations. Through reviewing architectural innovations and empirical results, this paper analyzes the transition from traditional generative methods to advanced architectures, with focus on compute-efficient diffusion models and vision transformer architectures. We examine how recent developments in Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and consistency models have redefined the capabilities and performance boundaries of image synthesis, while addressing persistent challenges in efficiency and quality. Our analysis focuses on the evolution of latent space representations, cross-attention mechanisms, and parameter-efficient training methodologies that enable accelerated inference under resource constraints. While more efficient training methods enable faster inference, advanced control mechanisms like ControlNet and regional attention systems have simultaneously improved generation precision and content customization. We investigate how enhanced multi-modal understanding and zero-shot generation capabilities are reshaping practical applications across industries. Our analysis demonstrates that despite remarkable advances in generation quality and computational efficiency, critical challenges remain in developing resource-conscious architectures and interpretable generation systems for industrial applications. The paper concludes by mapping promising research directions, including neural architecture optimization and explainable generation frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The imperfect modeling of ternary complexes has limited the application of computer-aided drug discovery tools in PROTAC research and development. In this study, an AI-assisted approach for PROTAC molecule design pipeline named LM-PROTAC was developed, which stands for language model driven Proteolysis Targeting Chimera, by embedding a transformer-based generative model with dual constraints on structure and properties, referred to as the DCT. This study utilized the fragmentation representation of molecules and developed a language model driven pipeline. Firstly, a language model driven affinity model for protein compounds to screen molecular fragments with high affinity for the target protein. Secondly, structural and physicochemical properties of these fragments were constrained during the generation process to meet specific scenario requirements. Finally, a two-round screening of the preliminary generated molecules using a multidimensional property prediction model to generate a batch of PROTAC molecules capable of degrading disease-relevant target proteins for validation in vitro experiments, thus achieving a complete solution for AI-assisted PROTAC drug generation. Taking the tumor key target Wnt3a as an example, the LM-PROTAC pipeline successfully generated PROTAC molecules capable of inhibiting Wnt3a. The results show that DCT can efficiently generate PROTAC that targets and hydrolyses Wnt3a.</p>

In such a challenging setting, it has only a tiny labeling budget to query the most informative samples to help it continuously learn. We present a comprehensive solution to this complex problem with our model "CUAL" (Continual Uncertainty-aware Active Learner). CUAL leverages an uncertainty estimation algorithm to prioritize active labeling of ambiguous (uncertain) predicted novel class samples while also simultaneously pseudo-labeling the most certain predictions of each class. Evaluations across multiple datasets, ablations, settings and backbones (e.g. ViT foundation model) demonstrate our method's effectiveness. We will release our code upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxu Wang, John J. Vastola</p>
<p>Abstract: By learning the gradient of smoothed data distributions, diffusion models can iteratively generate samples from complex distributions. The learned score function enables their generalization capabilities, but how the learned score relates to the score of the underlying data manifold remains largely unclear. Here, we aim to elucidate this relationship by comparing learned neural scores to the scores of two kinds of analytically tractable distributions: Gaussians and Gaussian mixtures. The simplicity of the Gaussian model makes it theoretically attractive, and we show that it admits a closed-form solution and predicts many qualitative aspects of sample generation dynamics. We claim that the learned neural score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) approximation for moderate to high noise scales, and supply both theoretical and empirical arguments to support this claim. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation empirically works for a larger range of noise scales than naive theory suggests it should, and is preferentially learned early in training. At smaller noise scales, we observe that learned scores are better described by a coarse-grained (Gaussian mixture) approximation of training data than by the score of the training distribution, a finding consistent with generalization. Our findings enable us to precisely predict the initial phase of trained models' sampling trajectories through their Gaussian approximations. We show that this allows the skipping of the first 15-30% of sampling steps while maintaining high sample quality (with a near state-of-the-art FID score of 1.93 on CIFAR-10 unconditional generation). This forms the foundation of a novel hybrid sampling method, termed analytical teleportation, which can seamlessly integrate with and accelerate existing samplers, including DPM-Solver-v3 and UniPC. Our findings suggest ways to improve the design and training of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Luo, Abhimanyu Kumbara, Mansur Shomali, Rui Han, Anand Iyer, Ritu Agarwal, Gordon Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: While previous studies of AI in diabetes management focus on long-term risk, research on near-future glucose prediction remains limited but important as it enables timely diabetes self-management. Integrating AI with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds promise for near-future glucose prediction. However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose. CGM-LSM is pretrained on 15.96 million glucose records from 592 diabetes patients for near-future glucose prediction. We evaluated CGM-LSM against state-of-the-art methods using the OhioT1DM dataset across various metrics, prediction horizons, and unseen patients. Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL. Robustness analyses revealed consistent performance not only for unseen patients and future periods, but also across diabetes type, age, and gender. The model demonstrated adaptability to different hours of day, maintaining accuracy across periods of various activity intensity levels. CGM-LSM represents a transformative step in diabetes management by leveraging pretraining to uncover latent glucose generation patterns in sensor data. Our findings also underscore the broader potential of LSMs to drive innovation across domains involving complex sensor data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serap A. Savari</p>
<p>Abstract: Superresolution theory and techniques seek to recover signals from samples in the presence of blur and noise. Discrete image registration can be an approach to fuse information from different sets of samples of the same signal. Quantization errors in the spatial domain are inherent to digital images. We consider superresolution and discrete image registration for one-dimensional spatially-limited piecewise constant functions which are subject to blur which is Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians as well as to round-off errors. We describe a signal-dependent measurement matrix which captures both types of effects. For this setting we show that the difficulties in determining the discontinuity points from two sets of samples even in the absence of other types of noise. If the samples are also subject to statistical noise, then it is necessary to align and segment the data sequences to make the most effective inferences about the amplitudes and discontinuity points. Under some conditions on the blur, the noise, and the distance between discontinuity points, we prove that we can correctly align and determine the first samples following each discontinuity point in two data sequences with an approach based on dynamic programming.</p>

<p>Abstract: As generative AI technologies find more and more real-world applications, the importance of testing their performance and safety seems paramount. ``Red-teaming'' has quickly become the primary approach to test AI models--prioritized by AI companies, and enshrined in AI policy and regulation. Members of red teams act as adversaries, probing AI systems to test their safety mechanisms and uncover vulnerabilities. Yet we know too little about this work and its implications. This essay calls for collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to study the sociotechnical systems surrounding AI technologies, including the work of red-teaming, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past. We highlight the importance of understanding the values and assumptions behind red-teaming, the labor involved, and the psychological impacts on red-teamers.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work studies the question of learning probabilistic deterministic automata from language models. For this purpose, it focuses on analyzing the relations defined on algebraic structures over strings by equivalences and similarities on probability distributions. We introduce a congruence that extends the classical Myhill-Nerode congruence for formal languages. This new congruence is the basis for defining regularity over language models. We present an active learning algorithm that computes the quotient with respect to this congruence whenever the language model is regular. The paper also defines the notion of recognizability for language models and shows that it coincides with regularity for congruences. For relations which are not congruences, it shows that this is not the case. Finally, it discusses the impact of this result on learning in the context of language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Memory layers use a trainable key-value lookup mechanism to add extra parameters to a model without increasing FLOPs. Conceptually, sparsely activated memory layers complement compute-heavy dense feed-forward layers, providing dedicated capacity to store and retrieve information cheaply. This work takes memory layers beyond proof-of-concept, proving their utility at contemporary scale. On downstream tasks, language models augmented with our improved memory layer outperform dense models with more than twice the computation budget, as well as mixture-of-expert models when matched for both compute and parameters. We find gains are especially pronounced for factual tasks. We provide a fully parallelizable memory layer implementation, demonstrating scaling laws with up to 128B memory parameters, pretrained to 1 trillion tokens, comparing to base models with up to 8B parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite multimodal sentiment analysis being a fertile research ground that merits further investigation, current approaches take up high annotation cost and suffer from label ambiguity, non-amicable to high-quality labeled data acquisition. Furthermore, choosing the right interactions is essential because the significance of intra- or inter-modal interactions can differ among various samples. To this end, we propose Semi-IIN, a Semi-supervised Intra-inter modal Interaction learning Network for multimodal sentiment analysis. Semi-IIN integrates masked attention and gating mechanisms, enabling effective dynamic selection after independently capturing intra- and inter-modal interactive information. Combined with the self-training approach, Semi-IIN fully utilizes the knowledge learned from unlabeled data. Experimental results on two public datasets, MOSI and MOSEI, demonstrate the effectiveness of Semi-IIN, establishing a new state-of-the-art on several metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyao Wang, Shiwen Ni, Huaren Liu, Shule Lu, Guhong Chen, Xi Feng, Chi Wei, Qiang Qu, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Yuan Lin, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, the field of patent processing has garnered increased attention within the natural language processing community. However, the majority of research has been concentrated on classification tasks, such as patent categorization and examination, or on short text generation tasks like patent summarization and patent quizzes. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task known as Draft2Patent, along with its corresponding D2P benchmark, which challenges LLMs to generate full-length patents averaging 17K tokens based on initial drafts. Patents present a significant challenge to LLMs due to their specialized nature, standardized terminology, and extensive length. We propose a multi-agent framework called AutoPatent which leverages the LLM-based planner agent, writer agents, and examiner agent with PGTree and RRAG to generate lengthy, intricate, and high-quality complete patent documents. The experimental results demonstrate that our AutoPatent framework significantly enhances the ability to generate comprehensive patents across various LLMs. Furthermore, we have discovered that patents generated solely with the AutoPatent framework based on the Qwen2.5-7B model outperform those produced by larger and more powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-72B, and LLAMA3.1-70B, in both objective metrics and human evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qibo Chen, Weizhong Jin, Jianyue Ge, Mengdi Liu, Yuchao Yan, Jian Jiang, Li Yu, Xuanjiang Guo, Shuchang Li, Jianzhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on universal object detection aims to introduce language in a SoTA closed-set detector and then generalize the open-set concepts by constructing large-scale (text-region) datasets for training. However, these methods face two main challenges: (i) how to efficiently use the prior information in the prompts to genericise objects and (ii) how to reduce alignment bias in the downstream tasks, both leading to sub-optimal performance in some scenarios beyond pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose a strong universal detection foundation model called CP-DETR, which is competitive in almost all scenarios, with only one pre-training weight. Specifically, we design an efficient prompt visual hybrid encoder that enhances the information interaction between prompt and visual through scale-by-scale and multi-scale fusion modules. Then, the hybrid encoder is facilitated to fully utilize the prompted information by prompt multi-label loss and auxiliary detection head. In addition to text prompts, we have designed two practical concept prompt generation methods, visual prompt and optimized prompt, to extract abstract concepts through concrete visual examples and stably reduce alignment bias in downstream tasks. With these effective designs, CP-DETR demonstrates superior universal detection performance in a broad spectrum of scenarios. For example, our Swin-T backbone model achieves 47.6 zero-shot AP on LVIS, and the Swin-L backbone model achieves 32.2 zero-shot AP on ODinW35. Furthermore, our visual prompt generation method achieves 68.4 AP on COCO val by interactive detection, and the optimized prompt achieves 73.1 fully-shot AP on ODinW13.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Gu, Zhuonan Zheng, Sheng Zhou, Meihan Liu, Jiawei Chen, Tanyu Qiao, Liangcheng Li, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, such as transaction and social net-works. However, their application is often hindered by the varyinghomophily levels across different orders of neighboring nodes, ne-cessitating separate model designs for homophilic and heterophilicgraphs. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified framework ca-pable of handling neighborhoods of various orders and homophilylevels. Through theoretical exploration, we identify a previouslyoverlooked architectural aspect in multi-hop learning: the cascadedependency, which leads to asmoothness-generalization dilemma.This dilemma significantly affects the learning process, especiallyin the context of high-order neighborhoods and heterophilic graphs.To resolve this issue, we propose an Inceptive Graph Neural Net-work (IGNN), a universal message-passing framework that replacesthe cascade dependency with an inceptive architecture. IGNN pro-vides independent representations for each hop, allowing personal-ized generalization capabilities, and captures neighborhood-wiserelationships to select appropriate receptive fields. Extensive ex-periments show that our IGNN outperforms 23 baseline methods,demonstrating superior performance on both homophilic and het-erophilic graphs, while also scaling efficiently to large graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditionally, learning the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network has been centralized, with all data pooled in one location. However, in real-world scenarios, data are often dispersed among multiple parties (e.g., companies, devices) that aim to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving their data privacy and security. In this study, we introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from data distributed horizontally across different parties. We propose a distributed structure learning method that leverages continuous optimization so that only model parameters are exchanged during optimization. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets reveal that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques, particularly when there are many clients with limited individual sample sizes.</p>

Our flow-based methods offer flexible model design while maintaining causal consistency regardless of the number of discretization steps. We propose design improvements that enable simultaneous learning of all causal mechanisms and reduce abduction and prediction complexity to linear O(n) relative to the number of layers, independent of the number of causal variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches and delivers consistent performance across a wide range of structural causal models in answering observational, interventional, and counterfactual questions. Additionally, our method achieves a significant reduction in computational time compared to existing diffusion-based techniques, making it practical for large structural causal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangliang Pan, David K. Y. Yau, Bo Zhou, Qihui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectrum prediction is considered to be a promising technology that enhances spectrum efficiency by assisting dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in cognitive radio networks (CRN). Nonetheless, the highly nonlinear nature of spectrum data across time, frequency, and space domains, coupled with the intricate spectrum usage patterns, poses challenges for accurate spectrum prediction. Deep learning (DL), recognized for its capacity to extract nonlinear features, has been applied to solve these challenges. This paper first shows the advantages of applying DL by comparing with traditional prediction methods. Then, the current state-of-the-art DL-based spectrum prediction techniques are reviewed and summarized in terms of intra-band and crossband prediction. Notably, this paper uses a real-world spectrum dataset to prove the advancements of DL-based methods. Then, this paper proposes a novel intra-band spatiotemporal spectrum prediction framework named ViTransLSTM. This framework integrates visual self-attention and long short-term memory to capture both local and global long-term spatiotemporal dependencies of spectrum usage patterns. Similarly, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on the aforementioned real-world dataset. Finally, the paper presents new related challenges and potential opportunities for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in robotic foundation models have enabled the development of generalist policies that can adapt to diverse tasks. While these models show impressive flexibility, their performance heavily depends on the quality of their training data. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning Distilled Generalists (RLDG), a method that leverages reinforcement learning to generate high-quality training data for finetuning generalist policies. Through extensive real-world experiments on precise manipulation tasks like connector insertion and assembly, we demonstrate that generalist policies trained with RL-generated data consistently outperform those trained with human demonstrations, achieving up to 40% higher success rates while generalizing better to new tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis that reveals this performance gain stems from both optimized action distributions and improved state coverage. Our results suggest that combining task-specific RL with generalist policy distillation offers a promising approach for developing more capable and efficient robotic manipulation systems that maintain the flexibility of foundation models while achieving the performance of specialized controllers.

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.</p>

To address these challenges, we propose CSL-L2M, a controllable song-level lyric-to-melody generation method based on an in-attention Transformer decoder with fine-grained lyric and musical controls, which is able to generate full-song melodies matched with the given lyrics and user-specified musical attributes. Specifically, we first introduce REMI-Aligned, a novel music representation that incorporates strict syllable- and sentence-level alignments between lyrics and melodies, facilitating precise alignment modeling. Subsequently, sentence-level semantic lyric embeddings independently extracted from a sentence-wise Transformer encoder are combined with word-level part-of-speech embeddings and syllable-level tone embeddings as fine-grained controls to enhance the controllability of lyrics over melody generation. Then we introduce human-labeled musical tags, sentence-level statistical musical attributes, and learned musical features extracted from a pre-trained VQ-VAE as coarse-grained, fine-grained and high-fidelity controls, respectively, to the generation process, thereby enabling user control over melody generation. Finally, an in-attention Transformer decoder technique is leveraged to exert fine-grained control over the full-song melody generation with the aforementioned lyric and musical conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CSL-L2M outperforms the state-of-the-art models, generating melodies with higher quality, better controllability and enhanced structure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Gilberto Barbosa de Medeiros J\'unior, Andre Guarnier de Mitri, Diego Furtado Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the lack of research on activation functions for neural network models in time series tasks. It highlights the need to identify essential properties of these activations to improve their effectiveness in specific domains. To this end, the study comprehensively analyzes properties, such as bounded, monotonic, nonlinearity, and periodicity, for activation in time series neural networks. We propose a new activation that maximizes the coverage of these properties, called LeakySineLU. We empirically evaluate the LeakySineLU against commonly used activations in the literature using 112 benchmark datasets for time series classification, obtaining the best average ranking in all comparative scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Rashed, Abdelkrim Kallich, Mohamed Eltayeb</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become integral to decision making in various domains, including healthcare, finance, education, and law enforcement. However, concerns about fairness and bias in these systems pose significant ethical and social challenges. This study investigates the fairness of ML models applied to structured datasets in classification tasks, highlighting the potential for biased predictions to perpetuate systemic inequalities. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle was selected for analysis, offering a realistic scenario for evaluating fairness in machine learning workflows.
  To assess and mitigate biases, three prominent fairness libraries; Fairlearn by Microsoft, AIF360 by IBM, and the What If Tool by Google were employed. These libraries provide robust frameworks for analyzing fairness, offering tools to evaluate metrics, visualize results, and implement bias mitigation strategies. The research aims to assess the extent of bias in the ML models, compare the effectiveness of these libraries, and derive actionable insights for practitioners.
  The findings reveal that each library has unique strengths and limitations in fairness evaluation and mitigation. By systematically comparing their capabilities, this study contributes to the growing field of ML fairness by providing practical guidance for integrating fairness tools into real world applications. These insights are intended to support the development of more equitable machine learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuqiang Lu, Zhenfei Yin, Mengwei He, Zhihui Wang, Zicheng Liu, Zhiyong Wang, Kun Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristof Meding, Christoph Sorge</p>
<p>Abstract: When does a digital image resemble reality? The relevance of this question increases as the generation of synthetic images -- so called deep fakes -- becomes increasingly popular. Deep fakes have gained much attention for a number of reasons -- among others, due to their potential to disrupt the political climate. In order to mitigate these threats, the EU AI Act implements specific transparency regulations for generating synthetic content or manipulating existing content. However, the distinction between real and synthetic images is -- even from a computer vision perspective -- far from trivial. We argue that the current definition of deep fakes in the AI act and the corresponding obligations are not sufficiently specified to tackle the challenges posed by deep fakes. By analyzing the life cycle of a digital photo from the camera sensor to the digital editing features, we find that: (1.) Deep fakes are ill-defined in the EU AI Act. The definition leaves too much scope for what a deep fake is. (2.) It is unclear how editing functions like Google's ``best take'' feature can be considered as an exception to transparency obligations. (3.) The exception for substantially edited images raises questions about what constitutes substantial editing of content and whether or not this editing must be perceptible by a natural person. Our results demonstrate that complying with the current AI Act transparency obligations is difficult for providers and deployers. As a consequence of the unclear provisions, there is a risk that exceptions may be either too broad or too limited. We intend our analysis to foster the discussion on what constitutes a deep fake and to raise awareness about the pitfalls in the current AI Act transparency obligations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is widely used in diffusion models but often introduces over-contrast and over-saturation artifacts at higher guidance strengths. We present EP-CFG (Energy-Preserving Classifier-Free Guidance), which addresses these issues by preserving the energy distribution of the conditional prediction during the guidance process. Our method simply rescales the energy of the guided output to match that of the conditional prediction at each denoising step, with an optional robust variant for improved artifact suppression. Through experiments, we show that EP-CFG maintains natural image quality and preserves details across guidance strengths while retaining CFG's semantic alignment benefits, all with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fang, Yuxuan Liang, Bo Hui, Zezhi Shao, Liwei Deng, Xu Liu, Xinke Jiang, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Road traffic forecasting is crucial in real-world intelligent transportation scenarios like traffic dispatching and path planning in city management and personal traveling. Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) stand out as the mainstream solution in this task. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of remarkable dynamic spatial modeling-based STGNNs has become the bottleneck over large-scale traffic data. From the spatial data management perspective, we present a novel Transformer framework called PatchSTG to efficiently and dynamically model spatial dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting with interpretability and fidelity. Specifically, we design a novel irregular spatial patching to reduce the number of points involved in the dynamic calculation of Transformer. The irregular spatial patching first utilizes the leaf K-dimensional tree (KDTree) to recursively partition irregularly distributed traffic points into leaf nodes with a small capacity, and then merges leaf nodes belonging to the same subtree into occupancy-equaled and non-overlapped patches through padding and backtracking. Based on the patched data, depth and breadth attention are used interchangeably in the encoder to dynamically learn local and global spatial knowledge from points in a patch and points with the same index of patches. Experimental results on four real world large-scale traffic datasets show that our PatchSTG achieves train speed and memory utilization improvements up to $10\times$ and $4\times$ with the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Sheng, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization (IFL) is a crucial technique for preventing tampered image misuse and protecting social safety. However, due to the rapid development of image tampering technologies, extracting more comprehensive and accurate forgery clues remains an urgent challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel information-theoretic IFL framework named SUMI-IFL that imposes sufficiency-view and minimality-view constraints on forgery feature representation. First, grounded in the theoretical analysis of mutual information, the sufficiency-view constraint is enforced on the feature extraction network to ensure that the latent forgery feature contains comprehensive forgery clues. Considering that forgery clues obtained from a single aspect alone may be incomplete, we construct the latent forgery feature by integrating several individual forgery features from multiple perspectives. Second, based on the information bottleneck, the minimality-view constraint is imposed on the feature reasoning network to achieve an accurate and concise forgery feature representation that counters the interference of task-unrelated features. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of SUMI-IFL to existing state-of-the-art methods, not only on in-dataset comparisons but also on cross-dataset comparisons.</p>

<p>Abstract: Two substantial technological advances have reshaped the public square in recent decades: first with the advent of the internet and second with the recent introduction of large language models (LLMs). LLMs offer opportunities for a paradigm shift towards more decentralized, participatory online spaces that can be used to facilitate deliberative dialogues at scale, but also create risks of exacerbating societal schisms. Here, we explore four applications of LLMs to improve digital public squares: collective dialogue systems, bridging systems, community moderation, and proof-of-humanity systems. Building on the input from over 70 civil society experts and technologists, we argue that LLMs both afford promising opportunities to shift the paradigm for conversations at scale and pose distinct risks for digital public squares. We lay out an agenda for future research and investments in AI that will strengthen digital public squares and safeguard against potential misuses of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Lin, Shuang Peng, Somil Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: As learning-based methods for legged robots rapidly grow in popularity, it is important that we can provide safety assurances efficiently across different controllers and environments. Existing works either rely on a priori knowledge of the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide assurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we propose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter framework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts the optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and dynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN facilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based input that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new obstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics uncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to construct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped controller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and hardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical quadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled dynamics without a priori access to the controllers or environments - hence, "One Filter to Deploy Them All". The experiment videos can be found on the project website.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quality of instruction data directly affects the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). Previously, \cite{li2023one} proposed \texttt{NUGGETS}, which identifies and selects high-quality quality data from a large dataset by identifying those individual instruction examples that can significantly improve the performance of different tasks after being learnt as one-shot instances. In this work, we propose \texttt{SuperNUGGETS}, an improved variant of \texttt{NUGGETS} optimised for efficiency and performance. Our \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} uses a small language model (SLM) instead of a large language model (LLM) to filter the data for outstanding one-shot instances and refines the predefined set of tests. The experimental results show that the performance of \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} only decreases by 1-2% compared to \texttt{NUGGETS}, but the efficiency can be increased by a factor of 58. Compared to the original \texttt{NUGGETS}, our \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} has a higher utility value due to the significantly lower resource consumption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is an attractive and significant research area in computer vision, which aims to recognize and track specific targets in video sequences where the target objects are arbitrary and class-agnostic. The VOT technology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse modalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one sensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT is also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent progress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning methods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal VOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular, we conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas and categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of multi-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language. Moreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed modalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful observations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction techniques aim to reduce examination time while maintaining high image fidelity, which is highly desirable in clinical settings for improving patient comfort and hospital efficiency. Existing deep learning methods typically reconstruct images from under-sampled data with traditional reconstruction approaches, but they still struggle to provide high-fidelity results. Diffusion models show great potential to improve fidelity of generated images in recent years. However, their inference process starting with a random Gaussian noise introduces instability into the results and usually requires thousands of sampling steps, resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction quality and low efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Cycle-Consistent Bridge Diffusion Model (CBDM). CBDM employs two bridge diffusion models to construct a cycle-consistent diffusion process with a consistency loss, enhancing the fine-grained details of reconstructed images and reducing the number of diffusion steps. Moreover, CBDM incorporates a Contourlet Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) which captures multi-scale structural texture knowledge in images through frequency domain decomposition pyramids and directional filter banks to improve structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model by higher reconstruction quality and fewer training iterations, achieving a new state of the art for accelerated MRI reconstruction in both fastMRI and IXI datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is crucial for enhancing affective computing and enriching the domain of human-computer interaction. However, the main challenge in SER lies in selecting relevant feature representations from speech signals with lower computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight SER architecture that integrates attention-based local feature blocks (ALFBs) to capture high-level relevant feature vectors from speech signals. We also incorporate a global feature block (GFB) technique to capture sequential, global information and long-term dependencies in speech signals. By aggregating attention-based local and global contextual feature vectors, our model effectively captures the internal correlation between salient features that reflect complex human emotional cues. To evaluate our approach, we extracted four types of spectral features from speech audio samples: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, mel-spectrogram, root mean square value, and zero-crossing rate. Through a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, we tested the proposed method on five multi-lingual standard benchmark datasets: TESS, RAVDESS, BanglaSER, SUBESCO, and Emo-DB, and obtained a mean accuracy of 99.65%, 94.88%, 98.12%, 97.94%, and 97.19% respectively. The results indicate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to most existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly advanced the field, achieving both panoptic and interactive segmentation of 3D scenes. However, existing methodologies often overlook the critical need for reconstructing specified targets with complex structures from sparse views. To address this issue, we introduce TSGaussian, a novel framework that combines semantic constraints with depth priors to avoid geometry degradation in challenging novel view synthesis tasks. Our approach prioritizes computational resources on designated targets while minimizing background allocation. Bounding boxes from YOLOv9 serve as prompts for Segment Anything Model to generate 2D mask predictions, ensuring semantic accuracy and cost efficiency. TSGaussian effectively clusters 3D gaussians by introducing a compact identity encoding for each Gaussian ellipsoid and incorporating 3D spatial consistency regularization. Leveraging these modules, we propose a pruning strategy to effectively reduce redundancy in 3D gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three standard datasets and a new challenging dataset we collected, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis of specific objects.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated using human-crafted benchmarks, under the premise that higher scores implicitly reflect stronger human-like performance. However, there is growing concern that LLMs may ``game" these benchmarks due to data leakage, achieving high scores while struggling with tasks simple for humans. To substantively address the problem, we create GAOKAO-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark based on China's National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao), and conduct ``closed-book" evaluations for representative models released prior to Gaokao. Contrary to prevailing consensus, even after addressing data leakage and comprehensiveness, GAOKAO-Eval reveals that high scores still fail to truly reflect human-aligned capabilities. To better understand this mismatch, We introduce the Rasch model from cognitive psychology to analyze LLM scoring patterns and identify two key discrepancies: 1) anomalous consistent performance across various question difficulties, and 2) high variance in performance on questions of similar difficulty. In addition, We identified inconsistent grading of LLM-generated answers among teachers and recurring mistake patterns. we find that the phenomenons are well-grounded in the motivations behind OpenAI o1, and o1's reasoning-as-difficulties can mitigate the mismatch. These results show that GAOKAO-Eval can reveal limitations in LLM capabilities not captured by current benchmarks and highlight the need for more LLM-aligned difficulty analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyun Kam, Myeongji Yun, Sunwoo Yoo, Seungwoo Hong, Zhengya Zhang, Youngjoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Low bit-precisions and their bit-slice sparsity have recently been studied to accelerate general matrix-multiplications (GEMM) during large-scale deep neural network (DNN) inferences. While the conventional symmetric quantization facilitates low-resolution processing with bit-slice sparsity for both weight and activation, its accuracy loss caused by the activation's asymmetric distributions cannot be acceptable, especially for large-scale DNNs. In efforts to mitigate this accuracy loss, recent studies have actively utilized asymmetric quantization for activations without requiring additional operations. However, the cutting-edge asymmetric quantization produces numerous nonzero slices that cannot be compressed and skipped by recent bit-slice GEMM accelerators, naturally consuming more processing energy to handle the quantized DNN models.
  To simultaneously achieve high accuracy and hardware efficiency for large-scale DNN inferences, this paper proposes an Asymmetrically-Quantized bit-Slice GEMM (AQS-GEMM) for the first time. In contrast to the previous bit-slice computing, which only skips operations of zero slices, the AQS-GEMM compresses frequent nonzero slices, generated by asymmetric quantization, and skips their operations. To increase the slice-level sparsity of activations, we also introduce two algorithm-hardware co-optimization methods: a zero-point manipulation and a distribution-based bit-slicing. To support the proposed AQS-GEMM and optimizations at the hardware-level, we newly introduce a DNN accelerator, Panacea, which efficiently handles sparse/dense workloads of the tiled AQS-GEMM to increase data reuse and utilization. Panacea supports a specialized dataflow and run-length encoding to maximize data reuse and minimize external memory accesses, significantly improving its hardware efficiency. Our benchmark evaluations show Panacea outperforms existing DNN accelerators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Yang, Haojin Yang, Soumajit Majumder, Jorge Cardoso, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that not each sample in a dataset is of equal importance during training. Data pruning aims to remove less important or informative samples while still achieving comparable results as training on the original (untruncated) dataset, thereby reducing storage and training costs. However, the majority of data pruning methods are applied to image classification tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore the feasibility of these pruning methods applied to object re-identification (ReID) tasks, while also presenting a more comprehensive data pruning approach. By fully leveraging the logit history during training, our approach offers a more accurate and comprehensive metric for quantifying sample importance, as well as correcting mislabeled samples and recognizing outliers. Furthermore, our approach is highly efficient, reducing the cost of importance score estimation by 10 times compared to existing methods. Our approach is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic framework that can eliminate/reduce 35%, 30%, and 5% of samples/training time on the VeRi, MSMT17 and Market1501 datasets, respectively, with negligible loss in accuracy (< 0.1%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> N. Sahakyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaione Bengoetxea, Mikel Zubillaga, Ekhi Azurmendi, Maite Heredia, Julen Etxaniz, Markel Ferro, Jeremy Barnes</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks: Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling, we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set, which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others; mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the training data on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhensheng Wang, Wenmian Yang, Kun Zhou, Yiquan Zhang, Weijia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: The real estate market relies heavily on structured data, such as property details, market trends, and price fluctuations. However, the lack of specialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the development of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we introduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question Answering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762 question-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property information, real estate company finance information and land auction information. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA poses greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures, open-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we propose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with spoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves the performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA and SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering research in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in open-domain and long-table question-answering.

<p>Abstract: The global outbreak of Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Current clinical detection techniques face limitations in accuracy and efficiency, necessitating improved automated diagnostic solutions. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) module, specifically designed to enhance multi-scale feature representation while optimizing computational efficiency. By integrating CAGA with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a score of 0.98% on the MCSI dataset, while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. This reduction in computational complexity maintains diagnostic accuracy while enabling broader deployment across resource-constrained healthcare settings. Extensive validation across two other benchmark datasets, including MSID and MSLD, demonstrate the model's robustness, consistently outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that CAGA's efficient feature extraction mechanism could be adapted for other medical imaging tasks requiring fine-grained visual discrimination.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transition to 6G networks promises unprecedented advancements in wireless communication, with increased data rates, ultra-low latency, and enhanced capacity. However, the complexity of managing and optimizing these next-generation networks presents significant challenges. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains by leveraging their sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities. However, the practical application of LLMs in wireless network orchestration and management remains largely unexplored. Existing literature predominantly offers visionary perspectives without concrete implementations, leaving a significant gap in the field. To address this gap, this paper presents NETORCHLLM, a wireless NETwork ORCHestrator LLM framework that uses LLMs to seamlessly orchestrate diverse wireless-specific models from wireless communication communities using their language understanding and generation capabilities. A comprehensive framework is introduced, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach and showcasing how LLMs can be effectively harnessed to optimize dense network operations, manage dynamic environments, and improve overall network performance. NETORCHLLM bridges the theoretical aspirations of prior research with practical, actionable solutions, paving the way for future advancements in integrating generative AI technologies within the wireless communications sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghua Hou, Shuhui Cao, Deqiang Ouyang, Ning Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As an algorithmic framework for learning to learn, meta-learning provides a promising solution for few-shot text classification. However, most existing research fail to give enough attention to class labels. Traditional basic framework building meta-learner based on prototype networks heavily relies on inter-class variance, and it is easily influenced by noise. To address these limitations, we proposes a simple and effective few-shot text classification framework. In particular, the corresponding label templates are embed into input sentences to fully utilize the potential value of class labels, guiding the pre-trained model to generate more discriminative text representations through the semantic information conveyed by labels. With the continuous influence of label semantics, supervised contrastive learning is utilized to model the interaction information between support samples and query samples. Furthermore, the averaging mechanism is replaced with an attention mechanism to highlight vital semantic information. To verify the proposed scheme, four typical datasets are employed to assess the performance of different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance enhancements and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on few-shot text classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Islem Bouzenia, Michael Pradel</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to execute the test suite of a project is essential in many scenarios, e.g., to assess code quality and code coverage, to validate code changes made by developers or automated tools, and to ensure compatibility with dependencies. Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test execution method that works across different projects. This paper presents ExecutionAgent, an automated technique that installs arbitrary projects, configures them to run test cases, and produces project-specific scripts to reproduce the setup. Inspired by the way a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language model-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with the host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the latest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines its process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies ExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming languages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully executes the test suites of 33/55 projects, while matching the test results of ground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5\%. These results improve over the best previously available technique by 6.6x. The costs imposed by the approach are reasonable, with an execution time of 74 minutes and LLM costs of 0.16 dollars, on average per project. We envision ExecutionAgent to serve as a valuable tool for developers, automated programming tools, and researchers that need to execute tests across a wide variety of projects.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136">Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous data structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to learn node embeddings through message passing on these structures. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to multiple graphs with different feature spaces, as existing GNN architectures are not designed for cross-graph feature alignment. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a textual description, enabling the use of a shared textual encoder to project nodes from different graphs into a unified feature space. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed data, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information with each node's properties, enhancing the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating that it enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data, even in the absence of textual information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Qin, Chao Chen, Zhihang Fu, Ze Chen, Dezhong Peng, Peng Hu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP), a well-known declarative logic programming paradigm, has recently found practical application in Process Mining. In particular, ASP has been used to model tasks involving declarative specifications of business processes. In this area, Declare stands out as the most widely adopted declarative process modeling language, offering a means to model processes through sets of constraints valid traces must satisfy, that can be expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces (LTLf). Existing ASP-based solutions encode Declare constraints by modeling the corresponding LTLf formula or its equivalent automaton which can be obtained using established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoding for Declare constraints that directly models their semantics as ASP rules, eliminating the need for intermediate representations. We assess the effectiveness of this novel approach on two Process Mining tasks by comparing it with alternative ASP encodings and a Python library for Declare.

<p>Abstract: Document classification is considered a critical element in automated document processing systems. In recent years multi-modal approaches have become increasingly popular for document classification. Despite their improvements, these approaches are underutilized in the industry due to their requirement for a tremendous volume of training data and extensive computational power. In this paper, we attempt to address these issues by embedding textual features directly into the visual space, allowing lightweight image-based classifiers to achieve state-of-the-art results using small-scale datasets in document classification. To evaluate the efficacy of the visual features generated from our approach on limited data, we tested on the standard dataset Tobacco-3482. Our experiments show a tremendous improvement in image-based classifiers, achieving an improvement of 4.64% using ResNet50 with no document pre-training. It also sets a new record for the best accuracy of the Tobacco-3482 dataset with a score of 91.14% using the image-based DocXClassifier with no document pre-training. The simplicity of the approach, its resource requirements, and subsequent results provide a good prospect for its use in industrial use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given an input video of a person and a new garment, the objective of this paper is to synthesize a new video where the person is wearing the specified garment while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. While significant advances have been made in image-based virtual try-ons, extending these successes to video often results in frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Some approaches have attempted to address this by increasing the overlap of frames across multiple video chunks, but this comes at a steep computational cost due to the repeated processing of the same frames, especially for long video sequence. To address these challenges, we reconceptualize video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, with garments serving as input conditions. Specifically, our approach enhances image diffusion models by incorporating temporal attention layers to improve temporal coherence. To reduce computational overhead, we introduce ShiftCaching, a novel technique that maintains temporal consistency while minimizing redundant computations. Furthermore, we introduce the \dataname~dataset, a new video try-on dataset featuring more complex backgrounds, challenging movements, and higher resolution compared to existing public datasets. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current baselines, particularly in terms of video consistency and inference speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daojun Liang, Haixia Zhang, Dongfeng Yuan, Minggao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of categories of instances in the real world is normally huge, and each instance may contain multiple labels. To distinguish these massive labels utilizing machine learning, eXtreme Label Classification (XLC) has been established. However, as the number of categories increases, the number of parameters and nonlinear operations in the classifier also rises. This results in a Classifier Computational Overload Problem (CCOP). To address this, we propose a Multi-Head Encoding (MHE) mechanism, which replaces the vanilla classifier with a multi-head classifier. During the training process, MHE decomposes extreme labels into the product of multiple short local labels, with each head trained on these local labels. During testing, the predicted labels can be directly calculated from the local predictions of each head. This reduces the computational load geometrically. Then, according to the characteristics of different XLC tasks, e.g., single-label, multi-label, and model pretraining tasks, three MHE-based implementations, i.e., Multi-Head Product, Multi-Head Cascade, and Multi-Head Sampling, are proposed to more effectively cope with CCOP. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that MHE can achieve performance approximately equivalent to that of the vanilla classifier by generalizing the low-rank approximation problem from Frobenius-norm to Cross-Entropy. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while significantly streamlining the training and inference processes of XLC tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Lorenz, Marta Kwiatkowska, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose one of the biggest threats to modern AI systems, necessitating robust defenses. While extensive efforts have been made to develop empirical defenses, attackers continue to evolve, creating sophisticated methods to circumvent these measures. To address this, we must move beyond empirical defenses and establish provable certification methods that guarantee robustness. This paper introduces a novel certification approach, BiCert, using Bilinear Mixed Integer Programming (BMIP) to compute sound deterministic bounds that provide such provable robustness. Using BMIP, we compute the reachable set of parameters that could result from training with potentially manipulated data. A key element to make this computation feasible is to relax the reachable parameter set to a convex set between training iterations. At test time, this parameter set allows us to predict all possible outcomes, guaranteeing robustness. BiCert is more precise than previous methods, which rely solely on interval and polyhedral bounds. Crucially, our approach overcomes the fundamental limitation of prior approaches where parameter bounds could only grow, often uncontrollably. We show that BiCert's tighter bounds eliminate a key source of divergence issues, resulting in more stable training and higher certified accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool-calling has changed Large Language Model (LLM) applications by integrating external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality across diverse tasks. However, this integration also introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly in the tool scheduling mechanisms of LLM, which have not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander, a novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling systems through adversarial tool injection. Our framework employs a well-designed two-stage attack strategy. Firstly, it injects malicious tools to collect user queries, then dynamically updates the injected tools based on the stolen information to enhance subsequent attacks. These stages enable ToolCommander to execute privacy theft, launch denial-of-service attacks, and even manipulate business competition by triggering unscheduled tool-calling. Notably, the ASR reaches 91.67% for privacy theft and hits 100% for denial-of-service and unscheduled tool calling in certain cases. Our work demonstrates that these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences beyond simple misuse of tool-calling systems, underscoring the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to secure LLM Tool-calling systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Tang, Davide Davoli, Tobias Kirschstein, Liam Schoneveld, Matthias Niessner</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for reconstructing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars from monocular videos captured by commodity devices like smartphones. Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve details of facial identity and appearance. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis by a 5.34\% higher SSIM score. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timour Ichmoukhamedov, James Hinns, David Martens</p>
<p>Abstract: A rapidly developing application of LLMs in XAI is to convert quantitative explanations such as SHAP into user-friendly narratives to explain the decisions made by smaller prediction models. Evaluating the narratives without relying on human preference studies or surveys is becoming increasingly important in this field. In this work we propose a framework and explore several automated metrics to evaluate LLM-generated narratives for explanations of tabular classification tasks. We apply our approach to compare several state-of-the-art LLMs across different datasets and prompt types. As a demonstration of their utility, these metrics allow us to identify new challenges related to LLM hallucinations for XAI narratives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shah Rukh Qasim, Patrick Owen, Nicola Serra</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a case for the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the design of physics instrument as an alternative to gradient-based instrument-optimization methods. It's applicability is demonstrated using two empirical studies. One is longitudinal segmentation of calorimeters and the second is both transverse segmentation as well longitudinal placement of trackers in a spectrometer. Based on these experiments, we propose an alternative approach that offers unique advantages over differentiable programming and surrogate-based differentiable design optimization methods. First, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms possess inherent exploratory capabilities, which help mitigate the risk of convergence to local optima. Second, this approach eliminates the necessity of constraining the design to a predefined detector model with fixed parameters. Instead, it allows for the flexible placement of a variable number of detector components and facilitates discrete decision-making. We then discuss the road map of how this idea can be extended into designing very complex instruments. The presented study sets the stage for a novel framework in physics instrument design, offering a scalable and efficient framework that can be pivotal for future projects such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), where most optimized detectors are essential for exploring physics at unprecedented energy scales.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry. Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a great challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics and exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation dataset. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, the evaluation on VBench and human double-blind test demonstrates consistency in character and motion, achieving state-of-the-art results in animation video generation. %We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, with specifically developed metrics for animation video generation. Our model access API and evaluation benchmark will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.002).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danielle R. Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Sanjit Kakarla, Jionghao Lin, Shambhavi Bhushan, Boyuan Guo, Erin Gatz, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: The role of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as effective learning tools has been debated in past research. While MCQs are widely used due to their ease in grading, open response questions are increasingly used for instruction, given advances in large language models (LLMs) for automated grading. This study evaluates MCQs effectiveness relative to open-response questions, both individually and in combination, on learning. These activities are embedded within six tutor lessons on advocacy. Using a posttest-only randomized control design, we compare the performance of 234 tutors (790 lesson completions) across three conditions: MCQ only, open response only, and a combination of both. We find no significant learning differences across conditions at posttest, but tutors in the MCQ condition took significantly less time to complete instruction. These findings suggest that MCQs are as effective, and more efficient, than open response tasks for learning when practice time is limited. To further enhance efficiency, we autograded open responses using GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo. GPT models demonstrate proficiency for purposes of low-stakes assessment, though further research is needed for broader use. This study contributes a dataset of lesson log data, human annotation rubrics, and LLM prompts to promote transparency and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aron Vallinder, Edward Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide a compelling foundation for building generally-capable AI agents. These agents may soon be deployed at scale in the real world, representing the interests of individual humans (e.g., AI assistants) or groups of humans (e.g., AI-accelerated corporations). At present, relatively little is known about the dynamics of multiple LLM agents interacting over many generations of iterative deployment. In this paper, we examine whether a "society" of LLM agents can learn mutually beneficial social norms in the face of incentives to defect, a distinctive feature of human sociality that is arguably crucial to the success of civilization. In particular, we study the evolution of indirect reciprocity across generations of LLM agents playing a classic iterated Donor Game in which agents can observe the recent behavior of their peers. We find that the evolution of cooperation differs markedly across base models, with societies of Claude 3.5 Sonnet agents achieving significantly higher average scores than Gemini 1.5 Flash, which, in turn, outperforms GPT-4o. Further, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can make use of an additional mechanism for costly punishment to achieve yet higher scores, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o fail to do so. For each model class, we also observe variation in emergent behavior across random seeds, suggesting an understudied sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We suggest that our evaluation regime could inspire an inexpensive and informative new class of LLM benchmarks, focussed on the implications of LLM agent deployment for the cooperative infrastructure of society.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Ruggeri, Gaetano Signorelli</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowei Li, Yuxuan Bian, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Qiang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marat Agranovskiy, Konstantin Yakovlev</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a path planning problem where the possible move actions are represented as a finite set of motion primitives aligned with the grid representation of the environment. That is, each primitive corresponds to a short kinodynamically-feasible motion of an agent and is represented as a sequence of the swept cells of a grid. Typically heuristic search, i.e. A*, is conducted over the lattice induced by these primitives (lattice-based planning) to find a path. However due to the large branching factor such search may be inefficient in practice. To this end we suggest a novel technique rooted in the idea of searching over the grid cells (as in vanilla A*) simultaneously fitting the possible sequences of the motion primitives into these cells. The resultant algorithm, MeshA*, provably preserves the guarantees on completeness and optimality, on the one hand, and is shown to notably outperform conventional lattice-based planning (x1.5 decrease in the runtime), on the other hand. Moreover, we suggest an additional pruning technique that additionally decreases the search space of MeshA*. The resultant planner is combined with the regular A* to retain completeness and is shown to further increase the search performance at the cost of negligible decrease of the solution quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zhu, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian, Chuan Guo, Ivan Evtimov</p>
<p>Abstract: Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large vision-language-action (VLA) models pretrained on extensive robot datasets offer promising generalist policies for robotic learning, they still struggle with spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics, making them less effective in handling complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: As key elements within the central dogma, DNA, RNA, and proteins play crucial roles in maintaining life by guaranteeing accurate genetic expression and implementation. Although research on these molecules has profoundly impacted fields like medicine, agriculture, and industry, the diversity of machine learning approaches-from traditional statistical methods to deep learning models and large language models-poses challenges for researchers in choosing the most suitable models for specific tasks, especially for cross-omics and multi-omics tasks due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive multi-omics benchmark COMET (Benchmark for Biological COmprehensive Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models), designed to evaluate models across single-omics, cross-omics, and multi-omics tasks. First, we curate and develop a diverse collection of downstream tasks and datasets covering key structural and functional aspects in DNA, RNA, and proteins, including tasks that span multiple omics levels. Then, we evaluate existing foundational language models for DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the newly proposed multi-omics method, offering valuable insights into their performance in integrating and analyzing data from different biological modalities. This benchmark aims to define critical issues in multi-omics research and guide future directions, ultimately promoting advancements in understanding biological processes through integrated and different omics data analysis.</p>

Region-level visual understanding presents significant challenges for large-scale vision-language models. While limited spatial awareness is a known issue, coarse-grained pretraining, in particular, exacerbates the difficulty of optimizing latent representations for effective encoder-decoder alignment. We propose AlignCap, a framework designed to enhance region-level understanding through fine-grained alignment of latent spaces. Our approach introduces a novel latent feature refinement module that enhances conditioned latent space representations to improve region-level captioning performance. We also propose an innovative alignment strategy, the semantic space alignment module, which boosts the quality of multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive learning in a novel manner within both modules to further enhance region-level captioning performance. To address spatial limitations, we employ a General Object Detection (GOD) method as a data preprocessing pipeline that enhances spatial reasoning at the regional level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves region-level captioning performance across various tasks</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid integration of video perception capabilities into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), the underlying mechanisms driving their video understanding remain poorly understood. Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, we present a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs.
  We begin by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, we explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, we demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. Our models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing $7$B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench. Apollo-7B is state-of-the-art compared to 7B LMMs with a 70.9 on MLVU, and 63.3 on Video-MME.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhao Zheng, Junjie Wu, Yao Zheng, Sicheng Zuo, Zixun Xie, Longchao Yang, Yong Pan, Zhihui Hao, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based autonomous driving shows great potential due to its satisfactory performance and low costs. Most existing methods adopt dense representations (e.g., bird's eye view) or sparse representations (e.g., instance boxes) for decision-making, which suffer from the trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency. This paper explores a Gaussian-centric end-to-end autonomous driving (GaussianAD) framework and exploits 3D semantic Gaussians to extensively yet sparsely describe the scene. We initialize the scene with uniform 3D Gaussians and use surrounding-view images to progressively refine them to obtain the 3D Gaussian scene representation. We then use sparse convolutions to efficiently perform 3D perception (e.g., 3D detection, semantic map construction). We predict 3D flows for the Gaussians with dynamic semantics and plan the ego trajectory accordingly with an objective of future scene forecasting. Our GaussianAD can be trained in an end-to-end manner with optional perception labels when available. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset verify the effectiveness of our end-to-end GaussianAD on various tasks including motion planning, 3D occupancy prediction, and 4D occupancy forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Yuanhui Huang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is important for autonomous driving due to its comprehensive perception of the surroundings. To incorporate sequential inputs, most existing methods fuse representations from previous frames to infer the current 3D occupancy. However, they fail to consider the continuity of driving scenarios and ignore the strong prior provided by the evolution of 3D scenes (e.g., only dynamic objects move). In this paper, we propose a world-model-based framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We reformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input. We decompose the scene evolution into three factors: 1) ego motion alignment of static scenes; 2) local movements of dynamic objects; and 3) completion of newly-observed scenes. We then employ a Gaussian world model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit these priors and infer the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space considering the current RGB observation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on the widely used nuScenes dataset. Our GaussianWorld improves the performance of the single-frame counterpart by over 2% in mIoU without introducing additional computations. Code: https://github.com/zuosc19/GaussianWorld.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Xu, Dingkang Yang, Mingcheng Li, Yuzheng Wang, Zhaoyu Chen, Jiawei Chen, Jinjie Wei, Lihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human multimodal language understanding (MLU) is an indispensable component of expression analysis (e.g., sentiment or humor) from heterogeneous modalities, including visual postures, linguistic contents, and acoustic behaviours. Existing works invariably focus on designing sophisticated structures or fusion strategies to achieve impressive improvements. Unfortunately, they all suffer from the subject variation problem due to data distribution discrepancies among subjects. Concretely, MLU models are easily misled by distinct subjects with different expression customs and characteristics in the training data to learn subject-specific spurious correlations, limiting performance and generalizability across new subjects. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a recapitulative causal graph to formulate the MLU procedure and analyze the confounding effect of subjects. Then, we propose SuCI, a simple yet effective causal intervention module to disentangle the impact of subjects acting as unobserved confounders and achieve model training via true causal effects. As a plug-and-play component, SuCI can be widely applied to most methods that seek unbiased predictions. Comprehensive experiments on several MLU benchmarks clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel H. Park, Tiffany J. Callahan, James L. Hedrick, Tim Erdmann, Sara Capponi</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate development of new, high-performance materials. More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowing others' intentions and taking others' perspectives are two core components of human intelligence that are typically considered to be instantiations of theory-of-mind. Infiltrating machines with these abilities is an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Recently, Li et al. built CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark to assess the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. Here, to investigate intentionality understanding and perspective-taking in Vision Language Models, we leverage the IntentBench and PerspectBench of CogDevelop2K, which contains over 300 cognitive experiments grounded in real-world scenarios and classic cognitive tasks, respectively. Surprisingly, we find VLMs achieving high performance on intentionality understanding but lower performance on perspective-taking. This challenges the common belief in cognitive science literature that perspective-taking at the corresponding modality is necessary for intentionality understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tang, Qian Chen, Wenjie Weng, Binhan Liao, Jiacheng Wang, Xianbin Cao, Xiaohuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) possess high mobility and flexible deployment capabilities, prompting the development of UAVs for various application scenarios within the Internet of Things (IoT). The unique capabilities of UAVs give rise to increasingly critical and complex tasks in uncertain and potentially harsh environments. The substantial amount of data generated from these applications necessitates processing and analysis through deep neural networks (DNNs). However, UAVs encounter challenges due to their limited computing resources when managing DNN models. This paper presents a joint approach that combines multiple-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and generative diffusion models (GDM) for assigning DNN tasks to a UAV swarm, aimed at reducing latency from task capture to result output. To address these challenges, we first consider the task size of the target area to be inspected and the shortest flying path as optimization constraints, employing a greedy algorithm to resolve the subproblem with a focus on minimizing the UAV's flying path and the overall system cost. In the second stage, we introduce a novel DNN task assignment algorithm, termed GDM-MADDPG, which utilizes the reverse denoising process of GDM to replace the actor network in multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). This approach generates specific DNN task assignment actions based on agents' observations in a dynamic environment. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm performs favorably compared to benchmarks in terms of path planning, Age of Information (AoI), energy consumption, and task load balancing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nico Roos</p>
<p>Abstract: In many situations humans have to reason with inconsistent knowledge. These inconsistencies may occur due to not fully reliable sources of information. In order to reason with inconsistent knowledge, it is not possible to view a set of premisses as absolute truths as is done in predicate logic. Viewing the set of premisses as a set of assumptions, however, it is possible to deduce useful conclusions from an inconsistent set of premisses. In this paper a logic for reasoning with inconsistent knowledge is described. This logic is a generalization of the work of N. Rescher [15]. In the logic a reliability relation is used to choose between incompatible assumptions. These choices are only made when a contradiction is derived. As long as no contradiction is derived, the knowledge is assumed to be consistent. This makes it possible to define an argumentation-based deduction process for the logic. For the logic a semantics based on the ideas of Y. Shoham [22, 23], is defined. It turns out that the semantics for the logic is a preferential semantics according to the definition S. Kraus, D. Lehmann and M. Magidor [12]. Therefore the logic is a logic of system P and possesses all the properties of an ideal non-monotonic logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Ruoyuan Gong, Hao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a focus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used embedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets to predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with challenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on extensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more interpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved issue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these limitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative system, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting roll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new insights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments using voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives, validating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA. This study not only demonstrates PAA's effectiveness but also its potential in political science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Huang, Hao Peng, Li Sun, Hui Lin, Chunyang Liu, Jiang Cao, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic embeddings have several advantages over deterministic embeddings as they map each data point to a distribution, which better describes the uncertainty and complexity of data. Many works focus on adjusting the distribution constraint under the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to enhance representation learning. However, these proposed regularization terms only consider the constraint of each latent variable, omitting the structural information between latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel structural entropy-guided probabilistic coding model, named SEPC. Specifically, we incorporate the relationship between latent variables into the optimization by proposing a structural entropy regularization loss. Besides, as traditional structural information theory is not well-suited for regression tasks, we propose a probabilistic encoding tree, transferring regression tasks to classification tasks while diminishing the influence of the transformation. Experimental results across 12 natural language understanding tasks, including both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate the superior performance of SEPC compared to other state-of-the-art models in terms of effectiveness, generalization capability, and robustness to label noise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liu, Wu Liu, Xiaoyan Gu, Yong Rui, Xiaodong He, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The believable simulation of multi-user behavior is crucial for understanding complex social systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made significant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large-scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi-agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system efficiency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadeer O. Ghosheh, Jin Li, Tingting Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records present a valuable modality for driving personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to fit individual-level differences. For this purpose, many data-driven machine learning and statistical models rely on the wealth of longitudinal EHRs to study patients' physiological and treatment effects. However, longitudinal EHRs tend to be sparse and highly missing, where missingness could also be informative and reflect the underlying patient's health status. Therefore, the success of data-driven models for personalized medicine highly depends on how the EHR data is represented from physiological data, treatments, and the missing values in the data. To this end, we propose a novel deep-learning model that learns the underlying patient dynamics over time across multivariate data to generate personalized realistic values conditioning on an individual's demographic characteristics and treatments. Our proposed model, IGNITE (Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records), utilises a conditional dual-variational autoencoder augmented with dual-stage attention to generate missing values for an individual. In IGNITE, we further propose a novel individualized missingness mask (IMM), which helps our model generate values based on the individual's observed data and missingness patterns. We further extend the use of IGNITE from imputing missingness to a personalized data synthesizer, where it generates missing EHRs that were never observed prior or even generates new patients for various applications. We validate our model on three large publicly available datasets and show that IGNITE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in missing data reconstruction and task prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Li, Wenshuai Zhao, Lijun Wu, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods typically assume that agents make decisions based on their local observations independently, which may not lead to a correlated joint policy with coordination. Coordination can be explicitly encouraged during training and individual policies can be trained to imitate the correlated joint policy. However, this may lead to an \textit{asymmetric learning failure} due to the observation mismatch between the joint and individual policies. Inspired by the concept of correlated equilibrium, we introduce a \textit{strategy modification} called AgentMixer that allows agents to correlate their policies. AgentMixer combines individual partially observable policies into a joint fully observable policy non-linearly. To enable decentralized execution, we introduce \textit{Individual-Global-Consistency} to guarantee mode consistency during joint training of the centralized and decentralized policies and prove that AgentMixer converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate Correlated Equilibrium. In the Multi-Agent MuJoCo, SMAC-v2, Matrix Game, and Predator-Prey benchmarks, AgentMixer outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI systems quickly improve in both breadth and depth of performance, they lend themselves to creating increasingly powerful and realistic agents, including the possibility of agents modeled on specific people. We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create custom AI agents to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death; indeed, the past year has seen a boom in startups purporting to offer such services. We call these generative ghosts, since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this paper, we reflect on the history of technologies for AI afterlives, including current early attempts by individual enthusiasts and startup companies to create generative ghosts. We then introduce a novel design space detailing potential implementations of generative ghosts, and use this analytic framework to ground discussion of the practical and ethical implications of various approaches to designing generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to better understand the risk/benefit landscape of this novel technology so as to ultimately empower people who wish to create and interact with AI afterlives to do so in a beneficial manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Beliaev, Ramtin Pedarsani</p>
<p>Abstract: In Imitation Learning (IL), utilizing suboptimal and heterogeneous demonstrations presents a substantial challenge due to the varied nature of real-world data. However, standard IL algorithms consider these datasets as homogeneous, thereby inheriting the deficiencies of suboptimal demonstrators. Previous approaches to this issue rely on impractical assumptions like high-quality data subsets, confidence rankings, or explicit environmental knowledge. This paper introduces IRLEED, Inverse Reinforcement Learning by Estimating Expertise of Demonstrators, a novel framework that overcomes these hurdles without prior knowledge of demonstrator expertise. IRLEED enhances existing Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithms by combining a general model for demonstrator suboptimality to address reward bias and action variance, with a Maximum Entropy IRL framework to efficiently derive the optimal policy from diverse, suboptimal demonstrations. Experiments in both online and offline IL settings, with simulated and human-generated data, demonstrate IRLEED's adaptability and effectiveness, making it a versatile solution for learning from suboptimal demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Fraternali, Luca Morandini, Sergio Luis Herrera Gonz\'alez</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection and characterization of illegal solid waste disposal sites are essential for environmental protection, particularly for mitigating pollution and health hazards. Improperly managed landfills contaminate soil and groundwater via rainwater infiltration, posing threats to both animals and humans. Traditional landfill identification approaches, such as on-site inspections, are time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for the identification and monitoring of solid waste disposal sites that enables broad coverage and repeated acquisitions over time. Earth Observation (EO) satellites, equipped with an array of sensors and imaging capabilities, have been providing high-resolution data for several decades. Researchers proposed specialized techniques that leverage remote sensing imagery to perform a range of tasks such as waste site detection, dumping site monitoring, and assessment of suitable locations for new landfills. This review aims to provide a detailed illustration of the most relevant proposals for the detection and monitoring of solid waste sites by describing and comparing the approaches, the implemented techniques, and the employed data. Furthermore, since the data sources are of the utmost importance for developing an effective solid waste detection model, a comprehensive overview of the satellites and publicly available data sets is presented. Finally, this paper identifies the open issues in the state-of-the-art and discusses the relevant research directions for reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of novel solid waste detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, numerous new benchmarks have been established to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) via either computing a holistic score or employing another LLM as a judge. However, these approaches suffer from data leakage due to the open access of the benchmark and inflexible evaluation process. To address this issue, we introduce $\textbf{TreeEval}$, a benchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs that let a high-performance LLM host an irreproducible evaluation session and essentially avoids the data leakage. Moreover, this LLM performs as an examiner to raise up a series of questions under a topic with a tree planing strategy, which considers the current evaluation status to decide the next question generation and ensures the completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process. We evaluate $6$ models of different parameter sizes, including $7$B, $13$B, and $33$B, and ultimately achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around $45$ questions. We also conduct more analysis to show the robustness and reliability of TreeEval. Our code can be accessed via the provided https://github.com/Ashura5/TreeEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nusrat Zahan, Philipp Burckhardt, Mikola Lysenko, Feross Aboukhadijeh, Laurie Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, suspicious domain connection, and arbitrary code execution as the top detected malicious activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel A. Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an 'epileptic'-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkai Huang, Yu Xia, Rui Wang, Kaige Xie, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably competent in various NLP tasks. However, it was observed by previous works that retrieval is not always helpful, especially when the LLM is already knowledgeable on the query to answer. Motivated by this, Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ARAG) studies retrieving only when the knowledge asked by the query is absent in the LLM. Previous works of ARAG either require accessing the pre-training corpus or prompting with additional model inferences. Aiming to avoid such drawbacks, we propose to determine whether the model is knowledgeable on a query via inspecting the (contextualized) pre-trained token embeddings of LLMs. We hypothesize that such embeddings capture rich information on the model's intrinsic knowledge base, which enables an efficient way of judging the necessity to retrieve from an external corpus. Extensive experiments demonstrate our ARAG approach's superior performance across various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihui Liu, Zihao Wang, Ruizhong Qiu, Yikun Ban, Eunice Chan, Yangqiu Song, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge F. Urb\'an, Petros Stefanou, Jos\'e A. Pons</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in ProbDR, that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate for the precision/inverse covariance) matrix using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, by showing that variances corresponding to these covariances are low (and misspecified), and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied, and pose two areas of research arising from these interpretations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Li, Guodong Long, Chunxu Zhang, Honglei Zhang, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RS), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRS), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this position paper provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Zhang, Long Jin, Yushan Zhu, Jiaoyan Chen, Zhiwei Huang, Junjie Wang, Yin Hua, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language question answering (QA) over structured data sources such as tables and knowledge graphs have been widely investigated, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years. The main solutions include question to formal query parsing and retrieval-based answer generation. However, current methods of the former often suffer from weak generalization, failing to dealing with multi-types of sources, while the later is limited in trustfulness. In this paper, we propose TrustUQA, a trustful QA framework that can simultaneously support multiple types of structured data in a unified way. To this end, it adopts an LLM-friendly and unified knowledge representation method called Condition Graph(CG), and uses an LLM and demonstration-based two-level method for CG querying. For enhancement, it is also equipped with dynamic demonstration retrieval. We have evaluated TrustUQA with 5 benchmarks covering 3 types of structured data. It outperforms 2 existing unified structured data QA methods. In comparison with the baselines that are specific to one data type, it achieves state-of-the-art on 2 of the datasets. Further more, we have demonstrated the potential of our method for more general QA tasks, QA over mixed structured data and QA across structured data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Machado Schwanck, Marcos Tomazzoli Leipnitz, Joel Lu\'is Carbonera, Juliano Araujo Wickboldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm in which many clients cooperatively train a single centralized model while keeping their data private and decentralized. FL is commonly used in edge computing, which involves placing computer workloads (both hardware and software) as close as possible to the edge, where the data is being created and where actions are occurring, enabling faster response times, greater data privacy, and reduced data transfer costs. However, due to the heterogeneous data distributions/contents of clients, it is non-trivial to accurately evaluate the contributions of local models in global centralized model aggregation. This is an example of a major challenge in FL, commonly known as data imbalance or class imbalance. In general, testing and assessing FL algorithms can be a very difficult and complex task due to the distributed nature of the systems. In this work, a framework is proposed and implemented to assess FL algorithms in a more easy and scalable way. This framework is evaluated over a distributed edge-like environment managed by a container orchestration platform (i.e. Kubernetes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohao Qu, Liangbo Ning, Rui An, Wenqi Fan, Tyler Derr, Hui Liu, Xin Xu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As one of the most representative DL techniques, Transformer architecture has empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models (LLMs) that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, JinYi Yoon, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh-Binh Nguyen, Chae Jung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a technique in self-supervised learning that focuses on acquiring detailed visual representations from unlabeled images by estimating the missing pixels in randomly masked sections. It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang, Chuanyu Qin, Zhe Liu, Kaijing Ma, Jin Chen, Han Fang, Chao Ban, Hao Sun, Zhongjiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view classification (MVC) faces inherent challenges due to domain gaps and inconsistencies across different views, often resulting in uncertainties during the fusion process. While Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) has been effective in addressing view uncertainty, existing methods predominantly rely on the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, which is sensitive to conflicting evidence and often neglects the critical role of neighborhood structures within multi-view data. To address these limitations, we propose a Trusted Unified Feature-NEighborhood Dynamics (TUNED) model for robust MVC. This method effectively integrates local and global feature-neighborhood (F-N) structures for robust decision-making. Specifically, we begin by extracting local F-N structures within each view. To further mitigate potential uncertainties and conflicts in multi-view fusion, we employ a selective Markov random field that adaptively manages cross-view neighborhood dependencies. Additionally, we employ a shared parameterized evidence extractor that learns global consensus conditioned on local F-N structures, thereby enhancing the global integration of multi-view features. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves accuracy and robustness over existing approaches, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and conflicting views. The code will be made available at https://github.com/JethroJames/TUNED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manshan Guo, Bhavin Choksi, Sari Sadiya, Alessandro T. Gifford, Martina G. Vilas, Radoslaw M. Cichy, Gemma Roig</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to human vision, artificial neural networks (ANNs) remain relatively susceptible to adversarial attacks. To address this vulnerability, efforts have been made to transfer inductive bias from human brains to ANNs, often by training the ANN representations to match their biological counterparts. Previous works relied on brain data acquired in rodents or primates using invasive techniques, from specific regions of the brain, under non-natural conditions (anesthetized animals), and with stimulus datasets lacking diversity and naturalness. In this work, we explored whether aligning model representations to human EEG responses to a rich set of real-world images increases robustness to ANNs. Specifically, we trained ResNet50-backbone models on a dual task of classification and EEG prediction; and evaluated their EEG prediction accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks. We observed significant correlation between the networks' EEG prediction accuracy, often highest around 100 ms post stimulus onset, and their gains in adversarial robustness. Although effect size was limited, effects were consistent across different random initializations and robust for architectural variants. We further teased apart the data from individual EEG channels and observed strongest contribution from electrodes in the parieto-occipital regions. The demonstrated utility of human EEG for such tasks opens up avenues for future efforts that scale to larger datasets under diverse stimuli conditions with the promise of stronger effects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) fine tuning is underutilized in the field of medicine. Two of the most common methods of fine tuning are Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), but there is little guidance informing users when to use either technique. In this investigation, we compare the performance of SFT and DPO for five common natural language tasks in medicine: Classification with text data, Classification with numeric data, Clinical Reasoning, Summarization, and Clinical Triage. We find that SFT alone is sufficient for Classification with text data, whereas DPO improves performance for the more complex tasks of Clinical Reasoning, Summarization and Clinical Triage. Our results establish the role and importance of DPO fine tuning within medicine, and consequently call attention to current software gaps that prevent widespread deployment of this technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Gang Yan, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Losing track of reading progress during line switching can be frustrating. Eye gaze tracking technology offers a potential solution by highlighting read paragraphs, aiding users in avoiding wrong line switches. However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunpeng Xu, Lifei Chen, Shengrui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to detect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware KAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN consists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation Module, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time series into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture local dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal representation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a KAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover inter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic transitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept identification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through a \textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzheng Si, Haozhe Zhao, Gang Chen, Yunshui Li, Kangyang Luo, Chuancheng Lv, Kaikai An, Fanchao Qi, Baobao Chang, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models to handle instructions with extremely long contexts has yet to be fully investigated. Previous studies attempt to scale up the available data volume by synthesizing long instruction-following samples, as constructing such a dataset tends to be challenging for annotators. However, a lack of a well-defined strategy for ensuring data quality may introduce low-quality samples and restrict the model performance. Thus, we propose GATEAU, a novel framework to address the unique challenge of long context alignment by identifying the influential samples enriched with long-range dependency relations. Specifically, GATEAU measures the long-range dependencies from two essential aspects: the difficulty of generating target responses due to the long-range dependencies, and the difficulty of understanding long inputs due to such dependencies. Comprehensive experiments indicate that GATEAU effectively identifies influential samples and the model trained on these selected samples exhibits better instruction-following and long-context understanding capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.
  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoop Cherian, Radu Corcodel, Siddarth Jain, Diego Romeres</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Aman Rangapur, Xiongxiao Xu, Yueqing Liang, Haroon Gharwi, Carl Yang, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing claim verification datasets often do not require systems to perform complex reasoning or effectively interpret multimodal evidence. To address this, we introduce a new task: multi-hop multimodal claim verification. This task challenges models to reason over multiple pieces of evidence from diverse sources, including text, images, and tables, and determine whether the combined multimodal evidence supports or refutes a given claim. To study this task, we construct MMCV, a large-scale dataset comprising 15k multi-hop claims paired with multimodal evidence, generated and refined using large language models, with additional input from human feedback. We show that MMCV is challenging even for the latest state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, especially as the number of reasoning hops increases. Additionally, we establish a human performance benchmark on a subset of MMCV. We hope this dataset and its evaluation task will encourage future research in multimodal multi-hop claim verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Xiang, Zhili Liu, Zihao Jiang, Yunshuang Nie, Runhui Huang, Haoxiang Fan, Hanhui Li, Weiran Huang, Yihan Zeng, Jianhua Han, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the ability of ``slow thinking" into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Contrary to existing methods that rely on direct or fast thinking, our key idea is to construct long chains of thought (CoT) consisting of atomic actions in a step-by-step manner, guiding MLLMs to perform complex reasoning. To this end, we design a novel AtomThink framework composed of three key modules: (i) a CoT annotation engine that automatically generates high-quality CoT annotations to address the lack of high-quality visual mathematical data; (ii) an atomic step fine-tuning strategy that jointly optimizes an MLLM and a policy reward model (PRM) for step-wise reasoning; and (iii) four different search strategies that can be applied with the PRM to complete reasoning. Additionally, we propose AtomMATH, a large-scale multimodal dataset of long CoTs, and an atomic capability evaluation metric for mathematical tasks. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving approximately 50\% relative accuracy gains on MathVista and 120\% on MathVerse. To support the advancement of multimodal slow-thinking models, we will make our code and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Lahiany, Oren Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: Curriculum Learning (CL), drawing inspiration from natural learning patterns observed in humans and animals, employs a systematic approach of gradually introducing increasingly complex training data during model development. Our work applies innovative CL methodologies to address the challenging geometric problem of monocular Visual Odometry (VO) estimation, which is essential for robot navigation in constrained environments. The primary objective of our research is to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks in monocular VO by investigating various curriculum learning strategies. We enhance the end-to-end Deep-Patch-Visual Odometry (DPVO) framework through the integration of novel CL approaches, with the goal of developing more resilient models capable of maintaining high performance across challenging environments and complex motion scenarios. Our research encompasses several distinctive CL strategies. We develop methods to evaluate sample difficulty based on trajectory motion characteristics, implement sophisticated adaptive scheduling through self-paced weighted loss mechanisms, and utilize reinforcement learning agents for dynamic adjustment of training emphasis. Through comprehensive evaluation on the diverse synthetic TartanAir dataset and complex real-world benchmarks such as EuRoC and TUM-RGBD, our Curriculum Learning-based Deep-Patch-Visual Odometry (CL-DPVO) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing SOTA methods, including both feature-based and learning-based VO approaches. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating curriculum learning principles into visual odometry systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wang, Rui Sun, Elizabeth Lui, Vatsal Shah, Xihan Xiong, Jiahao Sun, Davide Crapis, William Knottenbelt</p>
<p>Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Qian Yu, Chuang Wang, Haitao Zhou, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has demonstrated significant potential in domains such as iconography and sketching. However, SVGs generated from existing Text-to-SVG methods often lack editability and exhibit deficiencies in visual quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method to address these limitations. To enhance the editability of output SVGs, we introduce a Hierarchical Image VEctorization (HIVE) framework that operates at the semantic object level and supervises the optimization of components within the vector object. This approach facilitates the decoupling of vector graphics into distinct objects and component levels. Our proposed HIVE algorithm, informed by image segmentation priors, not only ensures a more precise representation of vector graphics but also enables fine-grained editing capabilities within vector objects. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we present a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD addresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample diversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector particles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby enhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We also show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles, capable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector design and poster design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subham Sahoo, Huai Wang, Frede Blaabjerg</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data and unseen fault scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online abusive content detection, particularly in low-resource settings and within the audio modality, remains underexplored. We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Pistillo, Charlotte Stix</p>
<p>Abstract: High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors.</p>

This study provided evidence that NLP can be used to improve the mapping process. As part of this investigation, the nominal classifications of standards and items specifications were used to examine construct equivalence. In the current paper, we determine the strength of empirical support for the semantic distinctiveness of these classifications, which are known as "domains" for Common Core standards, and "strands" for National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) item specifications. This is accomplished by separate k-means clustering for standards and specifications of their corresponding embedding vectors. We then briefly illustrate an application of these findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), coupled with SQL, is essential for data analysts involved in data exploration and analysis. However, data analysts often encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries skillfully, and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types that enhance the interpretation of query results. Due to its significance, substantial research efforts have been made to explore different approaches to address these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements primarily due to (1) complex database schema; (2) unclear user intent; (3) limited cross-domain generalization capability; and (4) insufficient end-to-end text-to-visualization capability.
  This paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, we propose hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the database schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize across data domains. Second, the EDA system is divided into four components (i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Finally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a user-friendly GUI interface in the production environment at PingCAP. We have also open-sourced all APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community. Through extensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight offers remarkable performance compared to human experts. Specifically, TiSQL achieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset using GPT-4. It also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Bird dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiding Zhu, Wenhui Dong, Jun Song, Yingbo Wang, Yanan Guo, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose SMMF (Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization), a memory-efficient optimizer that reduces the memory requirement of the widely used adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as Adam, by up to 96%. SMMF enables flexible and efficient factorization of an arbitrary rank (shape) of the first and second momentum tensors during optimization, based on the proposed square-matricization and one-time single matrix factorization. From this, it becomes effectively applicable to any rank (shape) of momentum tensors, i.e., bias, matrix, and any rank-d tensors, prevalent in various deep model architectures, such as CNNs (high rank) and Transformers (low rank), in contrast to existing memory-efficient optimizers that applies only to a particular (rank-2) momentum tensor, e.g., linear layers. We conduct a regret bound analysis of SMMF, which shows that it converges similarly to non-memory-efficient adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as AdamNC, providing a theoretical basis for its competitive optimization capability. In our experiment, SMMF takes up to 96% less memory compared to state-of-the-art memory efficient optimizers, e.g., Adafactor, CAME, and SM3, while achieving comparable model performance on various CNN and Transformer tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Xiao, Lei Shi, Peng Liu, Zhe Wang, Chenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward. Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks require identifying the relationship between sentence pairs, typically classified as entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. While the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Entailment Few-Shot Learning (EFL), achieves a 93.1% accuracy on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, further advancements are constrained by the dataset's limitations. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging synthetic data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity and complexity. We present UnitedSynT5, an advanced extension of EFL that leverages a T5-based generator to synthesize additional premise-hypothesis pairs, which are rigorously cleaned and integrated into the training data. These augmented examples are processed within the EFL framework, embedding labels directly into hypotheses for consistency. We train a GTR-T5-XL model on this expanded dataset, achieving a new benchmark of 94.7% accuracy on the SNLI dataset, 94.0% accuracy on the E-SNLI dataset, and 92.6% accuracy on the MultiNLI dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA models. This research demonstrates the potential of synthetic data augmentation in improving NLI models, offering a path forward for further advancements in natural language understanding tasks.</p>

In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Zimmerlin, Jens Bei{\ss}wenger, Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger, Kashyap Chitta</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip H. S. Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.
