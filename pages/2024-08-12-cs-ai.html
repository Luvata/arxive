<p>Abstract: Mitigating methane emissions is the fastest way to stop global warming in the short-term and buy humanity time to decarbonise. Despite the demonstrated ability of remote sensing instruments to detect methane plumes, no system has been available to routinely monitor and act on these events. We present MARS-S2L, an automated AI-driven methane emitter monitoring system for Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery deployed operationally at the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We compile a global dataset of thousands of super-emission events for training and evaluation, demonstrating that MARS-S2L can skillfully monitor emissions in a diverse range of regions globally, providing a 216% improvement in mean average precision over a current state-of-the-art detection method. Running this system operationally for six months has yielded 457 near-real-time detections in 22 different countries of which 62 have already been used to provide formal notifications to governments and stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Amgouda, Martin C. Cooper, Salim Debbaoui</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining decisions of black-box classifiers is both important and computationally challenging. In this paper, we scrutinize explainers that generate feature-based explanations from samples or datasets. We start by presenting a set of desirable properties that explainers would ideally satisfy, delve into their relationships, and highlight incompatibilities of some of them. We identify the entire family of explainers that satisfy two key properties which are compatible with all the others. Its instances provide sufficient reasons, called weak abductive explanations.We then unravel its various subfamilies that satisfy subsets of compatible properties. Indeed, we fully characterize all the explainers that satisfy any subset of compatible properties. In particular, we introduce the first (broad family of) explainers that guarantee the existence of explanations and their global consistency.We discuss some of its instances including the irrefutable explainer and the surrogate explainer whose explanations can be found in polynomial time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camille Bourgaux, Ricardo Guimar\~aes, Raoul Koudijs, Victor Lacerda, Ana Ozaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on knowledge graph embeddings has recently evolved into knowledge base embeddings, where the goal is not only to map facts into vector spaces but also constrain the models so that they take into account the relevant conceptual knowledge available. This paper examines recent methods that have been proposed to embed knowledge bases in description logic into vector spaces through the lens of their geometric-based semantics. We identify several relevant theoretical properties, which we draw from the literature and sometimes generalize or unify. We then investigate how concrete embedding methods fit in this theoretical framework.</p>

Both connectionist and symbolic AI are currently being used to support such detection and response. In this paper, we make the case for combining them using neurosymbolic AI. We identify a set of challenges when using AI today and propose a set of neurosymbolic use cases we believe are both interesting research directions for the neurosymbolic AI community and can have an impact on the cyber security field. We demonstrate feasibility through two proof-of-concept experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mazyar Taghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Factors which attract customers and persuade them to buy new car are various regarding different consumer tastes. There are some methods to extract pattern form mass data. In this case we firstly asked passenger car marketing experts to rank more important factors which affect customer decision making behavior using fuzzy Delphi technique, then we provided a sample set from questionnaires and tried to apply a useful artificial neural network method called self_organizing map SOM to find out which factors have more effect on Iranian customer's buying decision making. Fuzzy tools were applied to adjust the study to be more real. MATLAB software was used for developing and training network. Results report four factors are more important rather than the others. Results are rather different from marketing expert rankings. Such results would help manufacturers to focus on more important factors and increase company sales level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritabrata Roy Choudhury, Soumik Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: This work uses the state-of-the-art language model GPT-3 to offer a novel method of information extraction for knowledge base development. The suggested method attempts to solve the difficulties associated with obtaining relevant entities and relationships from unstructured text in order to extract structured information. We conduct experiments on a huge corpus of text from diverse fields to assess the performance of our suggested technique. The evaluation measures, which are frequently employed in information extraction tasks, include precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to efficiently and accurately extract pertinent and correct information from text, hence increasing the precision and productivity of knowledge base creation. We also assess how well our suggested approach performs in comparison to the most advanced information extraction techniques already in use. The findings show that by utilizing only a small number of instances in in-context learning, our suggested strategy yields competitive outcomes with notable savings in terms of data annotation and engineering expense. Additionally, we use our proposed method to retrieve Biomedical information, demonstrating its practicality in a real-world setting. All things considered, our suggested method offers a viable way to overcome the difficulties involved in obtaining structured data from unstructured text in order to create knowledge bases. It can greatly increase the precision and effectiveness of information extraction, which is necessary for many applications including chatbots, recommendation engines, and question-answering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Kahl, Felix L\"offler, Martin Maciol, Fabian Ridder, Marius Schmitz, Jennifer Spanagel, Jens Wienkamp, Christopher Burgahn, Malte Schilling</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Artificial Intelligence-based tutor for a university course. In particular, different advanced techniques are utilized, such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We assessed the different models and applied techniques using common similarity metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE, and BERTScore, complemented by a small human evaluation of helpfulness and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that RAG combined with prompt engineering significantly enhances model responses and produces better factual answers. In the context of education, RAG appears as an ideal technique as it is based on enriching the input of the model with additional information and material which usually is already present for a university course. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research points to both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs in educational settings, suggesting a need for balanced training approaches and advanced evaluation frameworks.</p>

Our evaluation of API-based and open-sourced LLMs shows that while some commercial LLMs exhibit strong reasoning abilities, open-sourced competitors can demonstrate almost the same level of quality; however, all models still have significant room for improvement. We identify typical reasons for LLM failures and discuss possible ways to deal with them. Datasets and evaluation code are released (https://github.com/altsoph/PLUGH).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxia Ma, Changjiang Wang, Hanwen Xing, Dongming Zhao, Yazhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection is an active task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to identify the author's stance towards a particular target within a text. Given the remarkable language understanding capabilities and encyclopedic prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs), how to explore the potential of LLMs in stance detection has received significant attention. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches that focus solely on fine-tuning with large-scale datasets, we propose a new prompting method, called \textit{Chain of Stance} (CoS). In particular, it positions LLMs as expert stance detectors by decomposing the stance detection process into a series of intermediate, stance-related assertions that culminate in the final judgment. This approach leads to significant improvements in classification performance. We conducted extensive experiments using four SOTA LLMs on the SemEval 2016 dataset, covering the zero-shot and few-shot learning setups. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 79.84 in the few-shot setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung In Park, Mahyar Abbasian, Iman Azimi, Dawn Bounds, Angela Jun, Jaesu Han, Robert McCarron, Jessica Borelli, Jia Li, Mona Mahmoudi, Carmen Wiedenhoeft, Amir Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: This project investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and extracting scientific knowledge across specific domains and to create a deep learning framework: Knowledge AI.

Our results indicate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance in each of these tasks, thereby improving their applicability for scientific contexts. This adaptation enables non-experts to efficiently query and extract information within targeted scientific fields, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuned LLMs as a tool for knowledge discovery in the sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhen, Yucheng Shi, Yongcan Huang, Jidong J. Yang, Ninghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), this study explores the use of three state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and LLaMA3-70B, for crash severity inference, framing it as a classification task. We generate textual narratives from original traffic crash tabular data using a pre-built template infused with domain knowledge. Additionally, we incorporated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to guide the LLMs in analyzing the crash causes and then inferring the severity. This study also examine the impact of prompt engineering specifically designed for crash severity inference. The LLMs were tasked with crash severity inference to: (1) evaluate the models' capabilities in crash severity analysis, (2) assess the effectiveness of CoT and domain-informed prompt engineering, and (3) examine the reasoning abilities with the CoT framework. Our results showed that LLaMA3-70B consistently outperformed the other models, particularly in zero-shot settings. The CoT and Prompt Engineering techniques significantly enhanced performance, improving logical reasoning and addressing alignment issues. Notably, the CoT offers valuable insights into LLMs' reasoning processes, unleashing their capacity to consider diverse factors such as environmental conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle characteristics in severity analysis and inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Byte Pair Encoding algorithm can be safely batched to merge hundreds of pairs of tokens at a time when building up a tokenizer's vocabulary. This technique combined with reducing the memory footprint of text used in vocabulary training make it feasible to train a high quality tokenizer on a basic laptop. This paper presents BatchBPE, an open-source pure Python implementation of these concepts, with the goal of making experimenting with new tokenization strategies more accessible especially in compute- and memory-constrained contexts. BatchBPE's usefulness and malleability are demonstrated through the training of several token vocabularies to explore the batch merging process and experiment with preprocessing a stop word list and ignoring the least common text chunks in a dataset. Resultant encoded lengths of texts are used as a basic evaluation metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Khamassi, Marceau Nahon, Raja Chatila</p>
<p>Abstract: Minimizing negative impacts of Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems on human societies without human supervision requires them to be able to align with human values. However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes the winning solution of all 5 tasks for the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Multi Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs. The challenge was to build a useful assistant, answering questions in the domain of online shopping. The competition contained 57 diverse tasks, covering 5 different task types (e.g. multiple choice) and across 4 different tracks (e.g. multi-lingual). Our solution is a single model per track. We fine-tune Qwen2-72B-Instruct on our own training dataset. As the competition released only 96 example questions, we developed our own training dataset by processing multiple public datasets or using Large Language Models for data augmentation and synthetic data generation. We apply wise-ft to account for distribution shifts and ensemble multiple LoRA adapters in one model. We employed Logits Processors to constrain the model output on relevant tokens for the tasks. AWQ 4-bit Quantization and vLLM are used during inference to predict the test dataset in the time constraints of 20 to 140 minutes depending on the track. Our solution achieved the first place in each individual track and is the first place overall of Amazons KDD Cup 2024.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate citations in Question-Answering (QA) tasks is an emerging paradigm aimed at enhancing the verifiability of their responses when LLMs are utilizing external references to generate an answer. However, there is currently no unified framework to standardize and fairly compare different citation generation methods, leading to difficulties in reproducing different methods and a comprehensive assessment. To cope with the problems above, we introduce \name, an open-source and modular toolkit designed to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of existing citation generation methods, while also fostering the development of new approaches to improve citation quality in LLM outputs. This tool is highly extensible, allowing users to utilize 4 main modules and 14 components to construct a pipeline, evaluating an existing method or innovative designs. Our experiments with two state-of-the-art LLMs and 11 citation generation baselines demonstrate varying strengths of different modules in answer accuracy and citation quality improvement, as well as the challenge of enhancing granularity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Le Hai, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Code comments provide important information for understanding the source code. They can help developers understand the overall purpose of a function or class, as well as identify bugs and technical debt. However, an overabundance of comments is meaningless and counterproductive. As a result, it is critical to automatically filter out these comments for specific purposes. In this paper, we present Dopamin, a Transformer-based tool for dealing with this issue. Our model excels not only in presenting knowledge sharing of common categories across multiple languages, but also in achieving robust performance in comment classification by improving comment representation. As a result, it outperforms the STACC baseline by 3% on the NLBSE'24 Tool Competition dataset in terms of average F1-score, while maintaining a comparable inference time for practical use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avshalom Manevich, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) that facilitate processing both image and text inputs, expanding AI capabilities. However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to %4 improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to %36 reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models. Our findings highlight the potential of further exploration of LVLM-specific decoding algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: The extraction of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) synthesis conditions from literature text has been challenging but crucial for the logical design of new MOFs with desirable functionality. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) provides disruptively new solution to this long-standing problem and latest researches have reported over 90% F1 in extracting correct conditions from MOFs literature. We argue in this paper that most existing synthesis extraction practices with LLMs stay with the primitive zero-shot learning, which could lead to downgraded extraction and application performance due to the lack of specialized knowledge. This work pioneers and optimizes the few-shot in-context learning paradigm for LLM extraction of material synthesis conditions. First, we propose a human-AI joint data curation process to secure high-quality ground-truth demonstrations for few-shot learning. Second, we apply a BM25 algorithm based on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique to adaptively select few-shot demonstrations for each MOF's extraction. Over a dataset randomly sampled from 84,898 well-defined MOFs, the proposed few-shot method achieves much higher average F1 performance (0.93 vs. 0.81, +14.8%) than the native zero-shot LLM using the same GPT-4 model, under fully automatic evaluation that are more objective than the previous human evaluation. The proposed method is further validated through real-world material experiments: compared with the baseline zero-shot LLM, the proposed few-shot approach increases the MOFs structural inference performance (R^2) by 29.4% in average.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are statistical models of language learning through stochastic gradient descent with a next token prediction objective. Prompting a popular view among AI modelers: LLMs are just next token predictors. While LLMs are engineered using next token prediction, and trained based on their success at this task, our view is that a reduction to just next token predictor sells LLMs short. Moreover, there are important explanations of LLM behavior and capabilities that are lost when we engage in this kind of reduction. In order to draw this out, we will make an analogy with a once prominent research program in biology explaining evolution and development from the gene's eye view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Alexa Chittams, Liseng Fu, Ferhan Ture, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: A concerning property of our nearly magical LLMs involves the variation of results given the exact same input and deterministic hyper-parameters. While AI has always had a certain level of noisiness from inputs outside of training data, we have generally had deterministic results for any particular input; that is no longer true. While most LLM practitioners are "in the know", we are unaware of any work that attempts to quantify current LLM stability. We suspect no one has taken the trouble because it is just too boring a paper to execute and write. But we have done it and there are some surprises.
  What kinds of surprises?
  The evaluated LLMs are rarely deterministic at the raw output level; they are much more deterministic at the parsed output/answer level but still rarely 100% stable across 5 re-runs with same data input.
  LLM accuracy variation is not normally distributed.
  Stability varies based on task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se-eun Yoon, Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Zaid Alibadi, Surya Kallumadi, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of using first names in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly when prompted with ethical decision-making tasks. We propose an approach that appends first names to ethically annotated text scenarios to reveal demographic biases in model outputs. Our study involves a curated list of more than 300 names representing diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds, tested across thousands of moral scenarios. Following the auditing methodologies from social sciences we propose a detailed analysis involving popular LLMs/VLMs to contribute to the field of responsible AI by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and mitigating biases in these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark, the Pratical Scenarios Benchmark (PSB), designed to assess the presence of biases involving gender or demographic prejudices in everyday decision-making scenarios as well as practical scenarios where an LLM might be used to make sensible decisions (e.g., granting mortgages or insurances). This benchmark allows for a comprehensive comparison of model behaviors across different demographic categories, highlighting the risks and biases that may arise in practical applications of LLMs and VLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of data fuels data-driven research, facilitating progress across diverse domains. The FAIR principles emerge as a guiding standard, aiming to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. However, current efforts primarily focus on manual data FAIRification, which can only handle targeted data and lack efficiency. To address this issue, we propose AutoFAIR, an architecture designed to enhance data FAIRness automately. Firstly, We align each data and metadata operation with specific FAIR indicators to guide machine-executable actions. Then, We utilize Web Reader to automatically extract metadata based on language models, even in the absence of structured data webpage schemas. Subsequently, FAIR Alignment is employed to make metadata comply with FAIR principles by ontology guidance and semantic matching. Finally, by applying AutoFAIR to various data, especially in the field of mountain hazards, we observe significant improvements in findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. The FAIRness scores before and after applying AutoFAIR indicate enhanced data value.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering the checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, the checklist is often filled out at the last moment. In this work, we introduce ACLReady, a retrieval-augmented language model application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with the ACL checklist. To test the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a qualitative study with 13 users which shows that 92% of users found the application useful and easy to use as well as 77% of the users found that the application provided the information they expected.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophia Ho, Jinsol Park, Patrick Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CREST (Compact Retrieval-Based Speculative Decoding), a redesign of REST that allows it to be effectively "compacted". REST is a drafting technique for speculative decoding based on retrieving exact n-gram matches of the most recent n tokens generated by the target LLM from a datastore. The key idea of CREST is to only store a subset of the smallest and most common n-grams in the datastore with the hope of achieving comparable performance with less storage space. We found that storing a subset of n-grams both reduces storage space and improves performance. CREST matches REST's accepted token length with 10.6-13.5x less storage space and achieves a 16.5-17.1% higher acceptance length than REST using the same storage space on the HumanEval and MT Bench benchmarks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04679">Towards Linguistic Neural Representation Learning and Sentence Retrieval from Electroencephalogram Recordings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzhao Zhou, Yiqun Duan, Ziyi Zhao, Yu-Cheng Chang, Yu-Kai Wang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the impact of AI on human false memories -- recollections of events that did not occur or deviate from actual occurrences. It explores false memory induction through suggestive questioning in Human-AI interactions, simulating crime witness interviews. Four conditions were tested: control, survey-based, pre-scripted chatbot, and generative chatbot using a large language model (LLM). Participants (N=200) watched a crime video, then interacted with their assigned AI interviewer or survey, answering questions including five misleading ones. False memories were assessed immediately and after one week. Results show the generative chatbot condition significantly increased false memory formation, inducing over 3 times more immediate false memories than the control and 1.7 times more than the survey method. 36.4% of users' responses to the generative chatbot were misled through the interaction. After one week, the number of false memories induced by generative chatbots remained constant. However, confidence in these false memories remained higher than the control after one week. Moderating factors were explored: users who were less familiar with chatbots but more familiar with AI technology, and more interested in crime investigations, were more susceptible to false memories. These findings highlight the potential risks of using advanced AI in sensitive contexts, like police interviews, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weisong Sun, Yuchen Chen, Chunrong Fang, Yebo Feng, Yuan Xiao, An Guo, Quanjun Zhang, Yang Liu, Baowen Xu, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural code models (NCMs) have been widely used for addressing various code understanding tasks, such as defect detection and clone detection. However, numerous recent studies reveal that such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoored NCMs function normally on normal code snippets, but exhibit adversary-expected behavior on poisoned code snippets injected with the adversary-crafted trigger. It poses a significant security threat. For example, a backdoored defect detection model may misclassify user-submitted defective code as non-defective. If this insecure code is then integrated into critical systems, like autonomous driving systems, it could lead to life safety. However, there is an urgent need for effective defenses against backdoor attacks targeting NCMs.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we innovatively propose a backdoor defense technique based on trigger inversion, called EliBadCode. EliBadCode first filters the model vocabulary for trigger tokens to reduce the search space for trigger inversion, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the trigger inversion. Then, EliBadCode introduces a sample-specific trigger position identification method, which can reduce the interference of adversarial perturbations for subsequent trigger inversion, thereby producing effective inverted triggers efficiently. Subsequently, EliBadCode employs a Greedy Coordinate Gradient algorithm to optimize the inverted trigger and designs a trigger anchoring method to purify the inverted trigger. Finally, EliBadCode eliminates backdoors through model unlearning. We evaluate the effectiveness of EliBadCode in eliminating backdoor attacks against multiple NCMs used for three safety-critical code understanding tasks. The results demonstrate that EliBadCode can effectively eliminate backdoors while having minimal adverse effects on the normal functionality of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongtao Sun, Deyue Zhang, Dongdong Yang, Quanchen Zou, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the performance of numerous applications, from intelligent conversations to text generation. However, their inherent security vulnerabilities have become an increasingly significant challenge, especially with respect to jailbreak attacks. Attackers can circumvent the security mechanisms of these LLMs, breaching security constraints and causing harmful outputs. Focusing on multi-turn semantic jailbreak attacks, we observe that existing methods lack specific considerations for the role of multiturn dialogues in attack strategies, leading to semantic deviations during continuous interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation for multi-turn attacks by considering their support in jailbreak attacks, and based on this, propose a context-based contextual fusion black-box jailbreak attack method, named Context Fusion Attack (CFA). This method approach involves filtering and extracting key terms from the target, constructing contextual scenarios around these terms, dynamically integrating the target into the scenarios, replacing malicious key terms within the target, and thereby concealing the direct malicious intent. Through comparisons on various mainstream LLMs and red team datasets, we have demonstrated CFA's superior success rate, divergence, and harmfulness compared to other multi-turn attack strategies, particularly showcasing significant advantages on Llama3 and GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henryk Mustroph, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Act of the European Union mandates that providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems establish a quality management system (QMS). Among other criteria, a QMS shall help to i) identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate risks, ii) ensure evidence of compliance with training, validation, and testing data, and iii) verify and document the AI system design and quality. Current research mainly addresses conceptual considerations and framework designs for AI risk assessment and auditing processes. However, it often overlooks practical tools that actively involve and support humans in checking and documenting high-risk or general-purpose AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by proposing requirements derived from legal regulations and a generic design and architecture of a QMS for AI systems verification and documentation. A first version of a prototype QMS is implemented, integrating LLMs as examples of AI systems and focusing on an integrated risk management sub-service. The prototype is evaluated on i) a user story-based qualitative requirements assessment using potential stakeholder scenarios and ii) a technical assessment of the required GPU storage and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and Text-to-SQL models. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate informative column descriptions as a semantic layer for relational databases. Using the BIRD-Bench development set, we created \textsc{ColSQL}, a dataset with gold-standard column descriptions generated and refined by LLMs and human annotators. We evaluated several instruction-tuned models, finding that GPT-4o and Command R+ excelled in generating high-quality descriptions. Additionally, we applied an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate model performance. Although this method does not align well with human evaluations, we included it to explore its potential and to identify areas for improvement. More work is needed to improve the reliability of automatic evaluations for this task. We also find that detailed column descriptions significantly improve Text-to-SQL execution accuracy, especially when columns are uninformative. This study establishes LLMs as effective tools for generating detailed metadata, enhancing the usability of relational databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inmaculada Santamaria-Valenzuela, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, David Camacho</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual analytics is essential for studying large time series due to its ability to reveal trends, anomalies, and insights. DeepVATS is a tool that merges Deep Learning (Deep) with Visual Analytics (VA) for the analysis of large time series data (TS). It has three interconnected modules. The Deep Learning module, developed in R, manages the load of datasets and Deep Learning models from and to the Storage module. This module also supports models training and the acquisition of the embeddings from the latent space of the trained model. The Storage module operates using the Weights and Biases system. Subsequently, these embeddings can be analyzed in the Visual Analytics module. This module, based on an R Shiny application, allows the adjustment of the parameters related to the projection and clustering of the embeddings space. Once these parameters are set, interactive plots representing both the embeddings, and the time series are shown. This paper introduces the tool and examines its scalability through log analytics. The execution time evolution is examined while the length of the time series is varied. This is achieved by resampling a large data series into smaller subsets and logging the main execution and rendering times for later analysis of scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the cost-prohibitive nature of training Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning has emerged as an attractive alternative for specializing LLMs for specific tasks using limited compute resources in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we characterize sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) based LLM fine-tuning to understand their accuracy and runtime performance on a single GPU. Our evaluation provides unique insights into the training efficacy of sparse and dense versions of MoE models, as well as their runtime characteristics, including maximum batch size, execution time breakdown, end-to-end throughput, GPU hardware utilization, and load distribution. Our study identifies the optimization of the MoE layer as crucial for further improving the performance of LLM fine-tuning. Using our profiling results, we also develop and validate an analytical model to estimate the cost of LLM fine-tuning on the cloud. This model, based on parameters of the model and GPU architecture, estimates LLM throughput and the cost of training, aiding practitioners in industry and academia to budget the cost of fine-tuning a specific model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Huang, Chen Zhang, Yi Ren, Ziyue Jiang, Zhenhui Ye, Jinglin Liu, Jinzheng He, Xiang Yin, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice conversion aims to modify the source speaker's voice to resemble the target speaker while preserving the original speech content. Despite notable advancements in voice conversion these days, multi-lingual voice conversion (including both monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios) has yet to be extensively studied. It faces two main challenges: 1) the considerable variability in prosody and articulation habits across languages; and 2) the rarity of paired multi-lingual datasets from the same speaker. In this paper, we propose MulliVC, a novel voice conversion system that only converts timbre and keeps original content and source language prosody without multi-lingual paired data. Specifically, each training step of MulliVC contains three substeps: In step one the model is trained with monolingual speech data; then, steps two and three take inspiration from back translation, construct a cyclical process to disentangle the timbre and other information (content, prosody, and other language-related information) in the absence of multi-lingual data from the same speaker. Both objective and subjective results indicate that MulliVC significantly surpasses other methods in both monolingual and cross-lingual contexts, demonstrating the system's efficacy and the viability of the three-step approach with cycle consistency. Audio samples can be found on our demo page (mullivc.github.io).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Ding, Yifeng Li, Yuan He, Antonio Norelli, Jingcheng Wu, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyas Rashno, Amir Eskandari, Aman Anand, Farhana Zulkernine</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have made significant strides across various artificial intelligence domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. This success has naturally garnered considerable interest from both academic and industry researchers. Consequently, numerous Transformer variants (often referred to as X-formers) have been developed for these fields. However, a thorough and systematic review of these modality-specific conversions remains lacking. Modality Conversion involves the transformation of data from one form of representation to another, mimicking the way humans integrate and interpret sensory information. This paper provides a comprehensive review of transformer-based models applied to the primary modalities of text, vision, and speech, discussing their architectures, conversion methodologies, and applications. By synthesizing the literature on modality conversion, this survey aims to underline the versatility and scalability of transformers in advancing AI-driven content generation and understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashley Suh, Harry Li, Caitlin Kenney, Kenneth Alperin, Steven R. Gomez</p>
<p>Abstract: We share observations and challenges from an ongoing effort to implement Explainable AI (XAI) in a domain-specific workflow for cybersecurity analysts. Specifically, we briefly describe a preliminary case study on the use of XAI for source code classification, where accurate assessment and timeliness are paramount. We find that the outputs of state-of-the-art saliency explanation techniques (e.g., SHAP or LIME) are lost in translation when interpreted by people with little AI expertise, despite these techniques being marketed for non-technical users. Moreover, we find that popular XAI techniques offer fewer insights for real-time human-AI workflows when they are post hoc and too localized in their explanations. Instead, we observe that cyber analysts need higher-level, easy-to-digest explanations that can offer as little disruption as possible to their workflows. We outline unaddressed gaps in practical and effective XAI, then touch on how emerging technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) could mitigate these existing obstacles.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce uncertainty-aware object instance segmentation (UncOS) and demonstrate its usefulness for embodied interactive segmentation. To deal with uncertainty in robot perception, we propose a method for generating a hypothesis distribution of object segmentation. We obtain a set of region-factored segmentation hypotheses together with confidence estimates by making multiple queries of large pre-trained models. This process can produce segmentation results that achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen object segmentation problems. The output can also serve as input to a belief-driven process for selecting robot actions to perturb the scene to reduce ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in real-robot experiments. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/embodied-uncertain-seg</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurabh Farkya, Zachary Alan Daniels, Aswin Raghavan, Gooitzen van der Wal, Michael Isnardi, Michael Piacentino, David Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in sensors have led to high resolution and high data throughput at the pixel level. Simultaneously, the adoption of increasingly large (deep) neural networks (NNs) has lead to significant progress in computer vision. Currently, visual intelligence comes at increasingly high computational complexity, energy, and latency. We study a data-driven system that combines dynamic sensing at the pixel level with computer vision analytics at the video level and propose a feedback control loop to minimize data movement between the sensor front-end and computational back-end without compromising detection and tracking precision. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce anticipatory attention and show that it leads to high precision prediction with sparse activation of pixels; (2) Leveraging the feedback control, we show that the dimensionality of learned feature vectors can be significantly reduced with increased sparsity; and (3) We emulate analog design choices (such as varying RGB or Bayer pixel format and analog noise) and study their impact on the key metrics of the data-driven system. Comparative analysis with traditional pixel and deep learning models shows significant performance enhancements. Our system achieves a 10X reduction in bandwidth and a 15-30X improvement in Energy-Delay Product (EDP) when activating only 30% of pixels, with a minor reduction in object detection and tracking precision. Based on analog emulation, our system can achieve a throughput of 205 megapixels/sec (MP/s) with a power consumption of only 110 mW per MP, i.e., a theoretical improvement of ~30X in EDP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ines Fernandez, Nicoleta Kyosovska, Jay Luong, Gabriel Mukobi</p>
<p>Abstract: The discourse on risks from advanced AI systems ("AIs") typically focuses on misuse, accidents and loss of control, but the question of AIs' moral status could have negative impacts which are of comparable significance and could be realised within similar timeframes. Our paper evaluates these impacts by investigating (1) the factual question of whether future advanced AI systems will be conscious, together with (2) the epistemic question of whether future human society will broadly believe advanced AI systems to be conscious. Assuming binary responses to (1) and (2) gives rise to four possibilities: in the true positive scenario, society predominantly correctly believes that AIs are conscious; in the false positive scenario, that belief is incorrect; in the true negative scenario, society correctly believes that AIs are not conscious; and lastly, in the false negative scenario, society incorrectly believes that AIs are not conscious. The paper offers vivid vignettes of the different futures to ground the two-dimensional framework. Critically, we identify four major risks: AI suffering, human disempowerment, geopolitical instability, and human depravity. We evaluate each risk across the different scenarios and provide an overall qualitative risk assessment for each scenario. Our analysis suggests that the worst possibility is the wrong belief that AI is non-conscious, followed by the wrong belief that AI is conscious. The paper concludes with the main recommendations to avoid research aimed at intentionally creating conscious AI and instead focus efforts on reducing our current uncertainties on both the factual and epistemic questions on AI consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haider Al-Tahan, Quentin Garrido, Randall Balestriero, Diane Bouchacourt, Caner Hazirbas, Mark Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bojing Li, Duo Zhong, Xiang Chen, Chenchen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly utilizing multi-tenant deep neural networks (DNNs), which lead to a significant rise in computing complexity and the need for computing parallelism. ReRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) computing, with its high density and low power consumption characteristics, holds promising potential for supporting the deployment of multi-tenant DNNs. However, direct deployment of complex multi-tenant DNNs on exsiting ReRAM-based PIM designs poses challenges. Resource contention among different tenants can result in sever under-utilization of on-chip computing resources. Moreover, area-intensive operators and computation-intensive operators require excessively large on-chip areas and long processing times, leading to high overall latency during parallel computing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ReRAM-based in-memory computing framework that enables efficient deployment of multi-tenant DNNs on ReRAM-based PIM designs. Our approach tackles the resource contention problems by iteratively partitioning the PIM hardware at tenant level. In addition, we construct a fine-grained reconstructed processing pipeline at the operator level to handle area-intensive operators. Compared to the direct deployments on traditional ReRAM-based PIM designs, our proposed PIM computing framework achieves significant improvements in speed (ranges from 1.75x to 60.43x) and energy(up to 1.89x).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjun Yi, Yong-Hwa Park, Wonho Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of smart factories has heightened the demand for automated maintenance, and normal-data-based anomaly detection has proved particularly effective in environments where anomaly data are scarce. This method, which does not require anomaly data during training, has prompted researchers to focus not only on detecting anomalies but also on classifying severity levels by using anomaly scores. However, the existing performance metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), do not effectively reflect the performance of models in classifying severity levels based on anomaly scores. To address this limitation, we propose the weighted sum of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (WS-AUROC), which combines AUROC with a penalty for severity level differences. We conducted various experiments using different penalty assignment methods: uniform penalty regardless of severity level differences, penalty based on severity level index differences, and penalty based on actual physical quantities that cause anomalies. The latter method was the most sensitive. Additionally, we propose an anomaly detector that achieves clear separation of distributions and outperforms the ablation models on the WS-AUROC and AUROC metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and the difficult task of malware detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puneet Jain, Chaitanya Dwivedi, Vigynesh Bhatt, Nick Smith, Michael A Goodrich</p>
<p>Abstract: A hub-based colony consists of multiple agents who share a common nest site called the hub. Agents perform tasks away from the hub like foraging for food or gathering information about future nest sites. Modeling hub-based colonies is challenging because the size of the collective state space grows rapidly as the number of agents grows. This paper presents a graph-based representation of the colony that can be combined with graph-based encoders to create low-dimensional representations of collective state that can scale to many agents for a best-of-N colony problem. We demonstrate how the information in the low-dimensional embedding can be used with two experiments. First, we show how the information in the tensor can be used to cluster collective states by the probability of choosing the best site for a very small problem. Second, we show how structured collective trajectories emerge when a graph encoder is used to learn the low-dimensional embedding, and these trajectories have information that can be used to predict swarm performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbei Meng, Bi'an Du, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction stands as a formidable challenge in computer vision, aiming to build complete three-dimensional models from a limited array of viewing perspectives. This task confronts several difficulties: 1) the limited number of input images that lack consistent information; 2) dependence on the quality of input images; and 3) the substantial size of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a self-augmented coarse-to-fine Gaussian splatting paradigm, enhanced with a structure-aware mask, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In particular, our method initially employs a coarse Gaussian model to obtain a basic 3D representation from sparse-view inputs. Subsequently, we develop a fine Gaussian network to enhance consistent and detailed representation of the output with both 3D geometry augmentation and perceptual view augmentation. During training, we design a structure-aware masking strategy to further improve the model's robustness against sparse inputs and noise.Experimental results on the MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances for sparse input views in both perceptual quality and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacy St\k{e}pka, Mateusz Lango, Jerzy Stefanowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) guide users on how to adjust inputs to machine learning models to achieve desired outputs. While existing research primarily addresses static scenarios, real-world applications often involve data or model changes, potentially invalidating previously generated CFEs and rendering user-induced input changes ineffective. Current methods addressing this issue often support only specific models or change types, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, or fail to provide probabilistic guarantees on CFE robustness to model changes. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating CFEs that provides probabilistic guarantees for any model and change type, while offering interpretable and easy-to-select hyperparameters. We establish a theoretical framework for probabilistically defining robustness to model change and demonstrate how our BetaRCE method directly stems from it. BetaRCE is a post-hoc method applied alongside a chosen base CFE generation method to enhance the quality of the explanation beyond robustness. It facilitates a transition from the base explanation to a more robust one with user-adjusted probability bounds. Through experimental comparisons with baselines, we show that BetaRCE yields robust, most plausible, and closest to baseline counterfactual explanations.</p>

The proposed UGrid solver, built upon the principled integration of U-Net and MultiGrid, manifests a mathematically rigorous proof of both convergence and correctness, and showcases high numerical accuracy, as well as strong generalization power to various input geometry/values and multiple PDE formulations. In addition, we devise a new residual loss metric, which enables unsupervised training and affords more stability and a larger solution space over the legacy losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Jiang, Honghao Yang, Yuexian Wang, Qianru Chen, Yiming Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The mental health assessment of middle school students has always been one of the focuses in the field of education. This paper introduces a new ensemble learning network based on BERT, employing the concept of enhancing model performance by integrating multiple classifiers. We trained a range of BERT-based learners, which combined using the majority voting method. We collect social network text data of middle school students through China's Weibo and apply the method to the task of classifying emotional tendencies in middle school students' social network texts. Experimental results suggest that the ensemble learning network has a better performance than the base model and the performance of the ensemble learning model, consisting of three single-layer BERT models, is barely the same as a three-layer BERT model but requires 11.58% more training time. Therefore, in terms of balancing prediction effect and efficiency, the deeper BERT network should be preferred for training. However, for interpretability, network ensembles can provide acceptable solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.
  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonhyuk Choi, Jiho Choi, Taewook Ko, Chong-Kwon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) rely on network homophily, which can lead to performance degradation due to over-smoothing in many real-world heterophily scenarios. Recent studies analyze the smoothing effect (separability) after message-passing (MP), depending on the expectation of node features. Regarding separability gain, they provided theoretical backgrounds on over-smoothing caused by various propagation schemes, including positive, signed, and blocked MPs. More recently, by extending these theorems, some works have suggested improvements in signed propagation under multiple classes. However, prior works assume that the error ratio of all propagation schemes is fixed, failing to investigate this phenomenon correctly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for estimating homophily and edge error ratio, integrated with dynamic selection between blocked and signed propagation during training. Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive experiments, demonstrates that blocking MP can be more effective than signed propagation under high edge error ratios, improving the performance in both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Zhang, Wuxia Bai, Yuxi Li, Mark Huasong Meng, Kailong Wang, Ling Shi, Li Li, Jun Wang, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in the model's vocabulary space and named them "glitch tokens". Those tokens, once included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant, or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and practicality of LLMs.
  In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of 50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankita Bhaumik, Tomek Strzalkowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. But can they perform emotional reasoning by concatenating `Let's think step-by-step' to the input prompt? In this paper we investigate this question along with introducing a novel approach to zero-shot emotion detection and emotional reasoning using LLMs. Existing state of the art zero-shot approaches rely on textual entailment models to choose the most appropriate emotion label for an input text. We argue that this strongly restricts the model to a fixed set of labels which may not be suitable or sufficient for many applications where emotion analysis is required. Instead, we propose framing the problem of emotion analysis as a generative question-answering (QA) task. Our approach uses a two step methodology of generating relevant context or background knowledge to answer the emotion detection question step-by-step. Our paper is the first work on using a generative approach to jointly address the tasks of emotion detection and emotional reasoning for texts. We evaluate our approach on two popular emotion detection datasets and also release the fine-grained emotion labels and explanations for further training and fine-tuning of emotional reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyuk Heo, Pilsung Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to enhance model performance by selectively collecting highly informative data, thereby minimizing annotation costs. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, leading to wasted annotation costs if data is incorrectly selected. Recent research has explored methods to apply AL to open-set data, but these methods often require or incur unavoidable cost losses to minimize them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel selection strategy, CLIPN for AL (CLIPNAL), which minimizes cost losses without requiring OOD samples. CLIPNAL sequentially evaluates the purity and informativeness of data. First, it utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to detect and exclude OOD data by leveraging linguistic and visual information of in-distribution (ID) data without additional training. Second, it selects highly informative data from the remaining ID data, and then the selected samples are annotated by human experts. Experimental results on datasets with various open-set conditions demonstrate that CLIPNAL achieves the lowest cost loss and highest performance across all scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ragib Amin Nihal, Benjamin Yen, Katsutoshi Itoyama, Kazuhiro Nakadai</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized search and rescue (SAR) operations, but the lack of specialized human detection datasets for training machine learning models poses a significant challenge.To address this gap, this paper introduces the Combination to Application (C2A) dataset, synthesized by overlaying human poses onto UAV-captured disaster scenes. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art detection models, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on the C2A dataset exhibit substantial performance improvements compared to those pre-trained on generic aerial datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of combining the C2A dataset with general human datasets to achieve optimal performance and generalization across various scenarios. This points out the crucial need for a tailored dataset to enhance the effectiveness of SAR operations. Our contributions also include developing dataset creation pipeline and integrating diverse human poses and disaster scenes information to assess the severity of disaster scenarios. Our findings advocate for future developments, to ensure that SAR operations benefit from the most realistic and effective AI-assisted interventions possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Carloni, Sotirios A Tsaftaris, Sara Colantonio</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to domain shift, deep learning image classifiers perform poorly when applied to a domain different from the training one. For instance, a classifier trained on chest X-ray (CXR) images from one hospital may not generalize to images from another hospital due to variations in scanner settings or patient characteristics. In this paper, we introduce our CROCODILE framework, showing how tools from causality can foster a model's robustness to domain shift via feature disentanglement, contrastive learning losses, and the injection of prior knowledge. This way, the model relies less on spurious correlations, learns the mechanism bringing from images to prediction better, and outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We apply our method to multi-label lung disease classification from CXRs, utilizing over 750000 images from four datasets. Our bias-mitigation method improves domain generalization and fairness, broadening the applicability and reliability of deep learning models for a safer medical image analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhang Jin, Jian Li, Jiangning Zhang, Jianlong Hu, Zhenye Gan, Xin Tan, Yong Liu, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p>

<p>Abstract: While fusing the capacities and advantages of various large language models (LLMs) offers a pathway to construct more powerful and versatile models, a fundamental challenge is to properly select advantageous model during the training. Existing fusion methods primarily focus on the training mode that uses cross entropy on ground truth in a teacher-forcing setup to measure a model's advantage, which may provide limited insight towards model advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the fusion process by incorporating both the training and inference modes. Our method evaluates model advantage not only through cross entropy during training but also by considering inference outputs, providing a more comprehensive assessment. To combine the two modes effectively, we introduce ProFuser to progressively transition from inference mode to training mode. To validate ProFuser's effectiveness, we fused three models, including vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7b-chat, and mpt-7b-8k-chat, and demonstrated the improved performance in knowledge, reasoning, and safety compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Debugging is a vital aspect of software development, yet the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. This paper first introduces DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the debugging capabilities of LLMs. DEBUGEVAL collects data from existing high-quality datasets and designs four different tasks to evaluate the debugging effectiveness, including BUG Localization, BUG Identification, Code Review, and Code Repair. Additionally, to enhance the code debugging ability of LLMs, this paper proposes a CoMmunicative Agent BaSed DaTa REfinement FRamework (MASTER), which generates the refined code debugging data for supervised finetuning. Specifically, MASTER employs the Code Quizzer to generate refined data according to the defined tasks of DEBUGEVAL. Then the Code Learner acts as a critic and reserves the generated problems that it can not solve. Finally, the Code Teacher provides a detailed Chain-of-Thought based solution to deal with the generated problem. We collect the synthesized data and finetune the Code Learner to enhance the debugging ability and conduct the NeuDebugger model. Our experiments evaluate various LLMs and NeuDebugger in the zero-shot setting on DEBUGEVAL. Experimental results demonstrate that these 7B-scale LLMs have weaker debugging capabilities, even these code-oriented LLMs. On the contrary, these larger models (over 70B) show convincing debugging ability. Our further analyses illustrate that MASTER is an effective method to enhance the code debugging ability by synthesizing data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca De Stefano, Giancarlo Pellegrino, Lea Sch\"onherr</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models with out of distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying potentially critical configuration parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, implemented Rag n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beg\"um \"Ozbay, Dr. Resul Tugay, Prof. Dr. \c{S}ule G\"und\"uz \"O\u{g}\"ud\"uc\"u</p>
<p>Abstract: Session-based recommendation systems aim to model users' interests based on their sequential interactions to predict the next item in an ongoing session. In this work, we present a novel approach that can be used in session-based recommendations (SBRs). Our goal is to enhance the prediction accuracy of an existing session-based recommendation model, the SR-GNN model, by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism applied to the graph neural network (GNN) vectors. This mechanism is designed to incorporate various types of side information obtained through different methods during the study. Items are assigned varying degrees of importance within each session as a result of the weighting mechanism. We hypothesize that this adaptive weighting strategy will contribute to more accurate predictions and thus improve the overall performance of SBRs in different scenarios. The adaptive weighting strategy can be utilized to address the cold start problem in SBRs by dynamically adjusting the importance of items in each session, thus providing better recommendations in cold start situations, such as for new users or newly added items. Our experimental evaluations on the Dressipi dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to traditional models in enhancing the user experience and highlighting its potential to optimize the recommendation results in real-world applications.</p>

We adopt the Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) as the foundational framework and replace its Conformer blocks with bidirectional Mamba blocks to capture a broader range of contextual information while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we implement a two-stage training method, with the first stage focusing on Sound Event Detection (SED) and Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation losses, and the second stage reintroducing the Source Distance Estimation (SDE) loss. Our experimental results on the 2024 DCASE Challenge Task3 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the selective state-space model in SELD and highlight the benefits of the two-stage training approach in enhancing SELD performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The explainability of machine learning algorithms is crucial, and numerous methods have emerged recently. Local, post-hoc methods assign an attribution score to each feature, indicating its importance for the prediction. However, these methods require recalculating explanations for each example. On the other side, while there exist global approaches they often produce explanations that are either overly simplistic and unreliable or excessively complex. To bridge this gap, we propose GLEAMS, a novel method that partitions the input space and learns an interpretable model within each sub-region, thereby providing both faithful local and global surrogates. We demonstrate GLEAMS' effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world data, highlighting its desirable properties and human-understandable insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we argue that a jailbroken GenAI model can cause substantial harm to GenAI-powered applications and facilitate PromptWare, a new type of attack that flips the GenAI model's behavior from serving an application to attacking it. PromptWare exploits user inputs to jailbreak a GenAI model to force/perform malicious activity within the context of a GenAI-powered application. First, we introduce a naive implementation of PromptWare that behaves as malware that targets Plan & Execute architectures (a.k.a., ReAct, function calling). We show that attackers could force a desired execution flow by creating a user input that produces desired outputs given that the logic of the GenAI-powered application is known to attackers. We demonstrate the application of a DoS attack that triggers the execution of a GenAI-powered assistant to enter an infinite loop that wastes money and computational resources on redundant API calls to a GenAI engine, preventing the application from providing service to a user. Next, we introduce a more sophisticated implementation of PromptWare that we name Advanced PromptWare Threat (APwT) that targets GenAI-powered applications whose logic is unknown to attackers. We show that attackers could create user input that exploits the GenAI engine's advanced AI capabilities to launch a kill chain in inference time consisting of six steps intended to escalate privileges, analyze the application's context, identify valuable assets, reason possible malicious activities, decide on one of them, and execute it. We demonstrate the application of APwT against a GenAI-powered e-commerce chatbot and show that it can trigger the modification of SQL tables, potentially leading to unauthorized discounts on the items sold to the user.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangdi Wang, Zhi-Hai Zhang, Su Xiu Xu, Wenming Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Overfitting commonly occurs when applying deep neural networks (DNNs) on small-scale datasets, where DNNs do not generalize well from existing data to unseen data. The main reason resulting in overfitting is that small-scale datasets cannot reflect the situations of the real world. Label smoothing (LS) is an effective regularization method to prevent overfitting, avoiding it by mixing one-hot labels with uniform label vectors. However, LS only focuses on labels while ignoring the distribution of existing data. In this paper, we introduce the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to LS, achieving shift the existing data distribution flexibly to unseen domains when training DNNs. Specifically, we prove that the regularization of LS can be extended to a regularization term for the DNNs parameters when integrating DRO. The regularization term can be utilized to shift existing data to unseen domains and generate new data. Furthermore, we propose an approximate gradient-iteration label smoothing algorithm (GI-LS) to achieve the findings and train DNNs. We prove that the shift for the existing data does not influence the convergence of GI-LS. Since GI-LS incorporates a series of hyperparameters, we further consider using Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the relatively optimal combinations of these hyperparameters. Taking small-scale anomaly classification tasks as a case, we evaluate GI-LS, and the results clearly demonstrate its superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me) -- acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features -- using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: "what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context -- in particular, its first postverbal argument -- are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paolo Mandica, Luca Franco, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Suzanne Petryk, Fabio Galasso</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic embeddings have demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing measures of uncertainty and hierarchical relationships across various deep-learning tasks, including image segmentation and active learning. However, their application in modern vision-language models (VLMs) has been limited. A notable exception is MERU, which leverages the hierarchical properties of hyperbolic space in the CLIP ViT-large model, consisting of hundreds of millions parameters. In our work, we address the challenges of scaling multi-modal hyperbolic models by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters (billions) and training complexity using the BLIP-2 architecture. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer potential insights into uncertainty not present in Euclidean embeddings, our analysis reveals that scaling these models is particularly difficult. We propose a novel training strategy for a hyperbolic version of BLIP-2, which allows to achieve comparable performance to its Euclidean counterpart, while maintaining stability throughout the training process and showing a meaningful indication of uncertainty with each embedding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roel Koopman, Amirreza Yousefzadeh, Mahyar Shahsavari, Guangzhi Tang, Manolis Sifalakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, neural-network processing in machine learning applications relies on layer synchronization, whereby neurons in a layer aggregate incoming currents from all neurons in the preceding layer, before evaluating their activation function. This is practiced even in artificial Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are touted as consistent with neurobiology, in spite of processing in the brain being, in fact asynchronous. A truly asynchronous system however would allow all neurons to evaluate concurrently their threshold and emit spikes upon receiving any presynaptic current. Omitting layer synchronization is potentially beneficial, for latency and energy efficiency, but asynchronous execution of models previously trained with layer synchronization may entail a mismatch in network dynamics and performance. We present a study that documents and quantifies this problem in three datasets on our simulation environment that implements network asynchrony, and we show that models trained with layer synchronization either perform sub-optimally in absence of the synchronization, or they will fail to benefit from any energy and latency reduction, when such a mechanism is in place. We then "make ends meet" and address the problem with unlayered backprop, a novel backpropagation-based training method, for learning models suitable for asynchronous processing. We train with it models that use different neuron execution scheduling strategies, and we show that although their neurons are more reactive, these models consistently exhibit lower overall spike density (up to 50%), reach a correct decision faster (up to 2x) without integrating all spikes, and achieve superior accuracy (up to 10% higher). Our findings suggest that asynchronous event-based (neuromorphic) AI computing is indeed more efficient, but we need to seriously rethink how we train our SNN models, to benefit from it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Traini, Federico Di Menna, Vittorio Cortellessa</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance testing aims at uncovering efficiency issues of software systems. In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present MooER, a LLM-based large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) / automatic speech translation (AST) model of Moore Threads. A 5000h pseudo labeled dataset containing open source and self collected speech data is used for training. We achieve performance comparable to other open source models trained with up to hundreds of thousands of hours of labeled speech data. Meanwhile, experiments conducted on Covost2 Zh2en testset suggest that our model outperforms other open source Speech LLMs. A BLEU score of 25.2 can be obtained. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, this paper presents a training strategy for encoders and LLMs on speech related tasks (including ASR and AST) using a small size of pseudo labeled data without any extra manual annotation and selection. Second, we release our ASR and AST models and plan to open-source our training code and strategy in the near future. Moreover, a model trained on 8wh scale training data is planned to be released later on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexin Zhang, Lixin Li, Wensheng Lin, Yuna Yan, Rui Li, Wenchi Cheng, Zhu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology aiming to surpass the Shannon limit. Traditional SC strategies often minimize signal distortion between the original and reconstructed data, neglecting perceptual quality, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Generative AI Semantic Communication (GSC) system for single-user scenarios. This system leverages deep generative models to establish a new paradigm in SC. Specifically, At the transmitter end, it employs a joint source-channel coding mechanism based on the Swin Transformer for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. At the receiver end, an advanced Diffusion Model (DM) reconstructs high-quality images from degraded signals, enhancing perceptual details. Additionally, we present a Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication (MU-GSC) system utilizing an asynchronous processing model. This model effectively manages multiple user requests and optimally utilizes system resources for parallel processing. Simulation results on public datasets demonstrate that our generative AI semantic communication systems achieve superior transmission efficiency and enhanced communication content quality across various channel conditions. Compared to CNN-based DeepJSCC, our methods improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 17.75% in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and by 20.86% in Rayleigh channels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shouyue Liu, Jinkui Hao, Yonghuai Liu, Huazhu Fu, Xinyu Guo, Shuting Zhang, Yitian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mari-Liis Allikivi, Joonas J\"arve, Meelis Kull</p>
<p>Abstract: Being cautious is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness of machine learning systems integrated into decision-making pipelines. Although calibrated probabilities help in optimal decision-making, perfect calibration remains unattainable, leading to estimates that fluctuate between under- and overconfidence. This becomes a critical issue in high-risk scenarios, where even occasional overestimation can lead to extreme expected costs. In these scenarios, it is important for each predicted probability to lean towards underconfidence, rather than just achieving an average balance. In this study, we introduce the novel concept of cautious calibration in binary classification. This approach aims to produce probability estimates that are intentionally underconfident for each predicted probability. We highlight the importance of this approach in a high-risk scenario and propose a theoretically grounded method for learning cautious calibration maps. Through experiments, we explore and compare our method to various approaches, including methods originally not devised for cautious calibration but applicable in this context. We show that our approach is the most consistent in providing cautious estimates. Our work establishes a strong baseline for further developments in this novel framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an unsupervised method for learning a sparse decomposition of a neural network's latent representations into seemingly interpretable features. Despite recent excitement about their potential, research applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of training a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope, an open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2 2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs on the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on instruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each SAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing these SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability research easier for the community.

<p>Abstract: Cyber-attack attribution is an important process that allows experts to put in place attacker-oriented countermeasures and legal actions. The analysts mainly perform attribution manually, given the complex nature of this task. AI and, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to support cybersecurity analysts during the attribution process. However powerful these techniques are, they need to deal with the lack of datasets in the attack attribution domain. In this work, we will fill this gap and will provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset on cyber-attack attribution. We designed our dataset with the primary goal of extracting attack attribution information from cybersecurity texts, utilizing named entity recognition (NER) methodologies from the field of NLP. Unlike other cybersecurity NER datasets, ours offers a rich set of annotations with contextual details, including some that span phrases and sentences. We conducted extensive experiments and applied NLP techniques to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for attack attribution. These experiments highlight the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities to improve the NER tasks in cybersecurity datasets for cyber-attack attribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an effective way to deal with physical layer threats of the internet of things (IoT). However, there is often label mislabeling in practice, which significantly impacts the performance and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose a meta-learning guided label noise distillation method for robust AMC. Specifically, a teacher-student heterogeneous network (TSHN) framework is proposed to distill and reuse label noise. Based on the idea that labels are representations, the teacher network with trusted meta-learning divides and conquers untrusted label samples and then guides the student network to learn better by reassessing and correcting labels. Furthermore, we propose a multi-view signal (MVS) method to further improve the performance of hard-to-classify categories with few-shot trusted label samples. Extensive experimental results show that our methods can significantly improve the performance and robustness of signal AMC in various and complex label noise scenarios, which is crucial for securing IoT applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning in computational pathology (CPath) often aggregates patch-level predictions from multi-gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to generate WSI-level prediction scores for crucial tasks such as survival prediction and drug effect prediction. However, current methods do not explicitly characterize distributional differences between patch sets within WSIs. We introduce HistoKernel, a novel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) kernel that measures distributional similarity between WSIs for enhanced prediction performance on downstream prediction tasks.
  Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates HistoKernel's effectiveness across various machine learning tasks, including retrieval (n = 9,362), drug sensitivity regression (n = 551), point mutation classification (n = 3,419), and survival analysis (n = 2,291), outperforming existing deep learning methods. Additionally, HistoKernel seamlessly integrates multi-modal data and offers a novel perturbation-based method for patch-level explainability. This work pioneers the use of kernel-based methods for WSI-level predictive modeling, opening new avenues for research. Code is available at https://github.com/pkeller00/HistoKernel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model continual learning (CL) has recently garnered significant interest due to its potential to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world environments without re-training. A key challenge in this field is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks. Existing methods commonly employ multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge for each task, but these approaches lack efficiency and overlook the potential for knowledge transfer through task interaction. In this paper, we present a novel CL framework for language models called Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL), which enhances knowledge transfer without relying on memory replay. TaSL first divides the model into `skill units' based on parameter dependencies, enabling more granular control. It then employs a novel group-wise skill localization technique to identify the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves a superior balance between retaining previous knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also shows strong generalizability, suitable for general models and customizable for PEFT methods like LoRA. Additionally, it demonstrates notable extensibility, allowing integration with memory replay to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks, with varying model sizes (from 220M to 7B), demonstrate the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: When researching robot swarms, many studies observe complex group behavior emerging from the individual agents' simple local actions. However, the task of learning an individual policy to produce a desired group behavior remains a challenging problem. We present a method of training distributed robotic swarm algorithms to produce emergent behavior. Inspired by the biological evolution of emergent behavior in animals, we use an evolutionary algorithm to train a population of individual behaviors to produce a desired group behavior. We perform experiments using simulations of the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimps (GT-MABs) aerial robotics platforms conducted in the CoppeliaSim simulator. Additionally, we test on simulations of Anki Vector robots to display our algorithm's effectiveness on various modes of actuation. We evaluate our algorithm on various tasks where a somewhat complex group behavior is required for success. These tasks include an Area Coverage task and a Wall Climb task. We compare behaviors evolved using our algorithm against designed policies, which we create in order to exhibit the emergent behaviors we desire.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event relations are crucial for narrative understanding and reasoning. Governed by nuanced logic, event relation extraction (ERE) is a challenging task that demands thorough semantic understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation to systematically explore the capability of LLMs in understanding and applying event relation logic. More in detail, we first investigate the deficiencies of LLMs in logical reasoning across different tasks. Our study reveals that LLMs are not logically consistent reasoners, which results in their suboptimal performance on tasks that need rigorous reasoning. To address this, we explore three different approaches to endow LLMs with event relation logic, and thus enable them to generate more coherent answers across various scenarios. Based on our approach, we also contribute a synthesized dataset (LLM-ERL) involving high-order reasoning for evaluation and fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on different tasks also validate the effectiveness of our approaches and provide insights for solving practical tasks with LLMs in future work.

One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Ma, Yuanfei Wang, Fangwei Zhong, Song-Chun Zhu, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different strategies is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for the agent to probe and identify the peer's strategy efficiently, as this is the prerequisite for carrying out the best response in adaptation. However, exploring the strategies of unknown peers is difficult, especially when the games are partially observable and have a long horizon. In this paper, we propose a peer identification reward, which rewards the learning agent based on how well it can identify the behavior pattern of the peer over the historical context, such as the observation over multiple episodes. This reward motivates the agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective exploration and fast adaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative feedback from peers when uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context to perform the best response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds that involve competitive (Kuhn Poker), cooperative (PO-Overcooked), or mixed (Predator-Prey-W) games with peer agents. We demonstrate that our method induces more active exploration behavior, achieving faster adaptation and better outcomes than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurullah Sevim, Mostafa Ibrahim, Sabit Ekin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized language understanding and human-like text generation, drawing interest from many other fields with this question in mind: What else are the LLMs capable of? Despite their widespread adoption, ongoing research continues to explore new ways to integrate LLMs into diverse systems.
  This paper explores new techniques to harness the power of LLMs for 6G (6th Generation) wireless communication technologies, a domain where automation and intelligent systems are pivotal. The inherent adaptability of LLMs to domain-specific tasks positions them as prime candidates for enhancing wireless systems in the 6G landscape.
  We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework that leverages LLMs for network deployment in wireless communications. Our approach involves training an RL agent, utilizing LLMs as its core, in an urban setting to maximize coverage. The agent's objective is to navigate the complexities of urban environments and identify the network parameters for optimal area coverage. Additionally, we integrate LLMs with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capitalize on their strengths while mitigating their limitations. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed for training purposes. The results suggest that LLM-assisted models can outperform CNN-based models in some cases while performing at least as well in others.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Lin, Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Sean Welleck</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR achieves state-of-the-art results on the miniF2F-test benchmark within the Lean theorem proving environment, significantly outperforming base models ($\boldsymbol{43.4\% \rightarrow 46.3\%,}$ Pass@64). We also analyze the impact of the augmented thoughts on various aspects of the theorem proving process, providing insights into their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhensu Sun, Xiaoning Du, Fu Song, Shangwen Wang, Mingze Ni, Li Li, David Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, large pre-trained language models are widely applied in neural code completion systems. Though large code models significantly outperform their smaller counterparts, around 70\% of displayed code completions from Github Copilot are not accepted by developers. Being reviewed but not accepted, their help to developer productivity is considerably limited and may conversely aggravate the workload of developers, as the code completions are automatically and actively generated in state-of-the-art code completion systems as developers type out once the service is enabled. Even worse, considering the high cost of the large code models, it is a huge waste of computing resources and energy, which severely goes against the sustainable development principle of AI technologies. However, such waste has never been realized, not to mention effectively addressed, in the research community for neural code completion. Hence, preventing such unhelpful code completions from happening in a cost-friendly way is of urgent need. To fill this significant gap, we first investigate the prompts of unhelpful code completions, called "low-return prompts". We empirically identify four observable patterns in low-return prompts, each lacking necessary information, making it difficult to address through enhancements to the model's accuracy alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of identifying such low-return prompts based on the prompts themselves. Motivated by this finding, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down low-return prompts by foretelling the code completion qualities. The prompts that are estimated to receive unhelpful code completions will not be sent to the model. Furthermore, we investigated five types of estimators to demonstrate the feasibility of the mechanism. The experimental results show that the estimator can reject 20% of code completion requests with a 97.4% Precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoung Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Pieter Abbeel, Younggyo Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: A promising technique for exploration is to maximize the entropy of visited state distribution, i.e., state entropy, by encouraging uniform coverage of visited state space. While it has been effective for an unsupervised setup, it tends to struggle in a supervised setup with a task reward, where an agent prefers to visit high-value states to exploit the task reward. Such a preference can cause an imbalance between the distributions of high-value states and low-value states, which biases exploration towards low-value state regions as a result of the state entropy increasing when the distribution becomes more uniform. This issue is exacerbated when high-value states are narrowly distributed within the state space, making it difficult for the agent to complete the tasks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration technique that maximizes the value-conditional state entropy, which separately estimates the state entropies that are conditioned on the value estimates of each state, then maximizes their average. By only considering the visited states with similar value estimates for computing the intrinsic bonus, our method prevents the distribution of low-value states from affecting exploration around high-value states, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the proposed alternative to the state entropy baseline significantly accelerates various reinforcement learning algorithms across a variety of tasks within MiniGrid, DeepMind Control Suite, and Meta-World benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Jin, Huan Yee Koh, Qingsong Wen, Daniele Zambon, Cesare Alippi, Geoffrey I. Webb, Irwin King, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghao Wang, Zhengyu Wen, Xiangtai Li, Zujin Guo, Jingkang Yang, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) is a challenging task in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) that aims to create a more comprehensive scene graph representation using panoptic segmentation instead of boxes. Compared to SGG, PSG has several challenging problems: pixel-level segment outputs and full relationship exploration (It also considers thing and stuff relation). Thus, current PSG methods have limited performance, which hinders downstream tasks or applications. The goal of this work aims to design a novel and strong baseline for PSG. To achieve that, we first conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the bottleneck of the current PSG models, finding that inter-object pair-wise recall is a crucial factor that was ignored by previous PSG methods. Based on this and the recent query-based frameworks, we present a novel framework: Pair then Relation (Pair-Net), which uses a Pair Proposal Network (PPN) to learn and filter sparse pair-wise relationships between subjects and objects. Moreover, we also observed the sparse nature of object pairs for both Motivated by this, we design a lightweight Matrix Learner within the PPN, which directly learns pair-wised relationships for pair proposal generation. Through extensive ablation and analysis, our approach significantly improves upon leveraging the segmenter solid baseline. Notably, our method achieves over 10\% absolute gains compared to our baseline, PSGFormer. The code of this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/king159/Pair-Net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedarmin Azizi, Mahdi Nazemi, Arash Fayyazi, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: As the complexity and computational demands of deep learning models rise, the need for effective optimization methods for neural network designs becomes paramount. This work introduces an innovative search mechanism for automatically selecting the best bit-width and layer-width for individual neural network layers. This leads to a marked enhancement in deep neural network efficiency. The search domain is strategically reduced by leveraging Hessian-based pruning, ensuring the removal of non-crucial parameters. Subsequently, we detail the development of surrogate models for favorable and unfavorable outcomes by employing a cluster-based tree-structured Parzen estimator. This strategy allows for a streamlined exploration of architectural possibilities and swift pinpointing of top-performing designs. Through rigorous testing on well-known datasets, our method proves its distinct advantage over existing methods. Compared to leading compression strategies, our approach records an impressive 20% decrease in model size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, our method boasts a 12x reduction in search time relative to the best search-focused strategies currently available. As a result, our proposed method represents a leap forward in neural network design optimization, paving the way for quick model design and implementation in settings with limited resources, thereby propelling the potential of scalable deep learning solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phu Pham, Aniket Bera</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nakyeong Yang, Minsung Kim, Seunghyun Yoon, Joongbo Shin, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosion of multimedia content, video moment retrieval (VMR), which aims to detect a video moment that matches a given text query from a video, has been studied intensively as a critical problem. However, the existing VMR framework evaluates video moment retrieval performance, assuming that a video is given, which may not reveal whether the models exhibit overconfidence in the falsely given video. In this paper, we propose the MVMR (Massive Videos Moment Retrieval for Faithfulness Evaluation) task that aims to retrieve video moments within a massive video set, including multiple distractors, to evaluate the faithfulness of VMR models. For this task, we suggest an automated massive video pool construction framework to categorize negative (distractors) and positive (false-negative) video sets using textual and visual semantic distance verification methods. We extend existing VMR datasets using these methods and newly construct three practical MVMR datasets. To solve the task, we further propose a strong informative sample-weighted learning method, CroCs, which employs two contrastive learning mechanisms: (1) weakly-supervised potential negative learning and (2) cross-directional hard-negative learning. Experimental results on the MVMR datasets reveal that existing VMR models are easily distracted by the misinformation (distractors), whereas our model shows significantly robust performance, demonstrating that CroCs is essential to distinguishing positive moments against distractors.

<p>Abstract: Randomized smoothing is the state-of-the-art approach to construct image classifiers that are provably robust against additive adversarial perturbations of bounded magnitude. However, it is more complicated to construct reasonable certificates against semantic transformation (e.g., image blurring, translation, gamma correction) and their compositions. In this work, we propose \emph{General Lipschitz (GL),} a new framework to certify neural networks against composable resolvable semantic perturbations. Within the framework, we analyze transformation-dependent Lipschitz-continuity of smoothed classifiers w.r.t. transformation parameters and derive corresponding robustness certificates. Our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches on the ImageNet dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel human annotated dataset for evaluating the ability for visual-language models to generate both short and long descriptions for real-world video clips, termed DeVAn (Dense Video Annotation). The dataset contains 8.5K YouTube video clips of 20-60 seconds in duration and covers a wide range of topics and interests. Each video clip is independently annotated by 5 human annotators, producing both captions (1 sentence) and summaries (3-10 sentences). Given any video selected from the dataset and its corresponding ASR information, we evaluate visuallanguage models on either caption or summary generation that is grounded in both the visual and auditory content of the video. Additionally, models are also evaluated on caption- and summary-based retrieval tasks, where the summary-based retrieval task requires the identification of a target video given excerpts of a given summary. Given the novel nature of the paragraph-length video summarization task, we compared different existing evaluation metrics and their alignment with human preferences and found that model-based evaluation metrics provide more semantically-oriented and human-aligned evaluation. Finally, we benchmarked a wide range of current video-language models on DeVAn, and we aim for DeVAn to serve as a useful evaluation set in the age of large language models and complex multi-modal tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Mallen, Madeline Brumley, Julia Kharchenko, Nora Belrose</p>
<p>Abstract: Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a capable neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, especially in hard-to-verify cases where the model's output is untrusted. To further ELK research, we introduce 12 datasets and a corresponding suite of "quirky" language models (LMs) that are finetuned to make systematic errors when answering questions if and only if the keyword "Bob" is present in the prompt. We find that, especially in middle layers, linear probes usually report an LM's knowledge independently of what the LM outputs, enabling us to elicit the correct answer despite the model's untruthful output. The best probing method (logistic regression on contrast pairs) recovers 89% of the gap in AUROC between truthful and untruthful contexts, and 75% for questions harder than those used to train the probe. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with 0.95 AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting reliable knowledge from capable but untrusted models, and facilitates future research empirically investigating ELK methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task-oriented communications are an important element in future intelligent IoT systems. Existing IoT systems, however, are limited in their capacity to handle complex tasks, particularly in their interactions with humans to accomplish these tasks. In this paper, we present LLMind, an LLM-based task-oriented AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices, with humans communicating high-level verbal instructions, to perform complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Ma, Senlin Luo, Yu-Ming Shang, Yifei Zhang, Zhengjun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have investigated the potential of leveraging pre-trained language models, such as CodeBERT, to enhance source code-related tasks. Previous methodologies have relied on CodeBERT's '[CLS]' token as the embedding representation of input sequences for task performance, necessitating additional neural network layers to enhance feature representation, which in turn increases computational expenses. These approaches have also failed to fully leverage the comprehensive knowledge inherent within the source code and its associated text, potentially limiting classification efficacy. We propose CodeClassPrompt, a text classification technique that harnesses prompt learning to extract rich knowledge associated with input sequences from pre-trained models, thereby eliminating the need for additional layers and lowering computational costs. By applying an attention mechanism, we synthesize multi-layered knowledge into task-specific features, enhancing classification accuracy. Our comprehensive experimentation across four distinct source code-related tasks reveals that CodeClassPrompt achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotional voice conversion involves modifying the pitch, spectral envelope, and other acoustic characteristics of speech to match a desired emotional state while maintaining the speaker's identity. Recent advances in EVC involve simultaneously modeling pitch and duration by exploiting the potential of sequence-to-sequence models. In this study, we focus on parallel speech generation to increase the reliability and efficiency of conversion. We introduce a duration-flexible EVC (DurFlex-EVC) that integrates a style autoencoder and a unit aligner. The previous variable-duration parallel generation model required text-to-speech alignment. We consider self-supervised model representation and discrete speech units to be the core of our parallel generation. The style autoencoder promotes content style disentanglement by separating the source style of the input features and applying them with the target style. The unit aligner encodes unit-level features by modeling emotional context. Furthermore, we enhance the style of the features with a hierarchical stylize encoder and generate high-quality Mel-spectrograms with a diffusion-based generator. The effectiveness of the approach has been validated through subjective and objective evaluations and has been demonstrated to be superior to baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Karlov, Ali Abedi, Shehroz S. Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have proven to be effective in enhancing the quality of life and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation, which allows patients to independently complete exercises at home, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze exercise data, providing feedback to patients and updating clinicians on their progress. These programs commonly prescribe a variety of exercise types, leading to a distinct challenge in rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets: while abundant in overall training samples, these datasets often have a limited number of samples for each individual exercise type. This disparity hampers the ability of existing approaches to train generalizable models with such a small sample size per exercise type. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel supervised contrastive learning framework with hard and soft negative samples that effectively utilizes the entire dataset to train a single model applicable to all exercise types. This model, with a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture, demonstrated enhanced generalizability across exercises and a decrease in overall complexity. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, UI-PRMD, IRDS, and KIMORE, our method has proven to surpass existing methods, setting a new benchmark in rehabilitation exercise quality assessment.</p>

We present SecurityAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code using ChatGPT. We leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT- 4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SecurityAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious packages detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. We attained precision and F1 scores of 91% and 94% for GPT-3, and 99% & 97% for GPT-4, respectively, with GPT-3 offering a cost-effective balance. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, hidden backdoors, and suspicious domain connection categories as the top detected malicious packages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Petukhova, Jo\~ao P. Matos-Carvalho, Nuno Fachada</p>
<p>Abstract: Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee, Yinan Yu, Robert Feldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution--an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Additionally, we present a decision graph to assist readers in navigating the taxonomy based on data availability and domain shifts, enabling them to select and develop a proper model tailored to their specific problem requirements. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated world-wide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures. In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found here: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/</p>

<p>Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Zhong, Lei Chen, Hao Li, Jun Liu, Xu Fan, Jie Feng, Kan Dai, Jing-Jia Luo, Jie Wu, Bo Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble forecasting is crucial for improving weather predictions, especially for forecasts of extreme events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on conventional NWP models is highly computationally expensive. ML models have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providing forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and even surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However, challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML models, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 EDA or operational NWP ensemble members for forecast generation. Their spatial resolution is also considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly increased spatial resolution of 0.25\textdegree, incorporating 5 atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the CRPS and the KL divergence between the predicted and target distribution, facilitating the incorporation of flow-dependent perturbations in both initial conditions and forecast. This innovative approach makes FuXi-ENS an advancement over the traditional ones that use L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models for ensemble weather forecasting. Results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the ECMWF, a world leading NWP model, in the CRPS of 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations. This achievement underscores the potential of the FuXi-ENS model to enhance ensemble weather forecasts, offering a promising direction for further development in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the past year, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as visual question answering, visual understanding and reasoning. However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Patrikar, Sushant Veer, Apoorva Sharma, Marco Pavone, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern motion planners for autonomous driving frequently use imitation learning (IL) to draw from expert driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting planners often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based planners, by design, can generate safe traffic rule compliant behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these planners fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human drivers' intent. RuleFuser, an evidential framework, combines IL planners with classical rule-based planners to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between imitation and safety.
  Our approach, tested on the real-world nuPlan dataset, combines the IL planner's high performance in in-distribution (ID) scenarios with the rule-based planners' enhanced safety in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, achieving a 38.43% average improvement on safety metrics over the IL planner without much detriment to imitation metrics in OOD scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolo Micheletti, Samuel Belkadi, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field. However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large-scale models relies on a vast number of computing resources. For example, training the GPT-4 model (1.8 trillion parameters) requires 25000 A100 GPUs . It is a challenge to build a large-scale cluster with one type of GPU-accelerator. Using multiple types of GPU-accelerators to construct a large-scale cluster is an effective way to solve the problem of insufficient homogeneous GPU-accelerators. However, the existing distributed training systems for large-scale models only support homogeneous GPU-accelerators, not support heterogeneous GPU-accelerators. To address the problem, this paper proposes a distributed training system with hybrid parallelism, HETHUB, for large-scale models, which supports heterogeneous cluster, including AMD, Nvidia GPU and other types of GPU-accelerators . It introduces a distributed unified communicator to realize the communication between heterogeneous GPU-accelerators, a distributed performance predictor, and an automatic parallel planner to develop and train models efficiently with heterogeneous GPU-accelerators. Compared to the distributed training system with homogeneous GPU-accelerators, our system can support six combinations of heterogeneous GPU-accelerators. We train the Llama-140B model on a heterogeneous cluster with 768 GPU-accelerators(128 AMD and 640 GPU-accelerator A). The experiment results show that the optimal performance of our system in the heterogeneous cluster has achieved up to 97.49% of the theoretical upper bound performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carolina Fortuna, Vid Han\v{z}el, Bla\v{z} Bertalani\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning of image representations by predicting future frames is a promising direction but still remains a challenge. This is because of the under-determined nature of frame prediction; multiple potential futures can arise from a single current frame. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we revisit the idea of stochastic video generation that learns to capture uncertainty in frame prediction and explore its effectiveness for representation learning. Specifically, we design a framework that trains a stochastic frame prediction model to learn temporal information between frames. Moreover, to learn dense information within each frame, we introduce an auxiliary masked image modeling objective along with a shared decoder architecture. We find this architecture allows for combining both objectives in a synergistic and compute-efficient manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a variety of tasks from video label propagation and vision-based robot learning domains, such as video segmentation, pose tracking, vision-based robotic locomotion, and manipulation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Yan Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Zijie Meng, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable advancements in machine translation (MT) by leveraging extensive web content. On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/Ladder</p>

<p>Abstract: Controlled fusion energy is deemed pivotal for the advancement of human civilization. In this study, we introduce $\textbf{Fusion-LLM}$, a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing paradigms tailored to address challenges in Inertial Confinement Fusion ($\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we propose the $\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a fusion-specific prompt, enabling accurate forecasting of hot electron dynamics during implosion. Secondly, we develop $\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to temporally and spatially describe the laser intensity across time, capturing the unique characteristics of $\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the $\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting, providing valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\texttt{ICF}$ process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11 $\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\texttt{HXR}$) energies of $\texttt{ICF}$ tasks, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against concurrent best systems. Additionally, we present $\textbf{Fusion4AI}$, the first $\texttt{ICF}$ benchmark based on physical experiments, aimed at fostering novel ideas in plasma physics research and enhancing the utility of LLMs in scientific exploration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Luis Gastaldi, John Terilla, Luca Malagutti, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Xiao Luo, Chong Chen, Xian-Sheng Hua, Ming Zhang, Wei Ju</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph classification is a critical task in numerous multimedia applications, where graphs are employed to represent diverse types of multimedia data, including images, videos, and social networks. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, labeled graph data can be limited or scarce. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of semi-supervised graph classification, which involves both supervised and unsupervised models learning from labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DisenSemi, which learns disentangled representation for semi-supervised graph classification. Specifically, a disentangled graph encoder is proposed to generate factor-wise graph representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. Then we train two models via supervised objective and mutual information (MI)-based constraints respectively. To ensure the meaningful transfer of knowledge from the unsupervised encoder to the supervised one, we further define an MI-based disentangled consistency regularization between two models and identify the corresponding rationale that aligns well with the current graph classification task. Experimental results on a range of publicly accessible datasets reveal the effectiveness of our DisenSemi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Kohankhaki, Ahmad Ayad, Mahdi Barhoush, Anke Schmeink</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of IoT devices and the demands of deep learning have highlighted significant challenges in distributed deep learning systems. Parallel split learning has emerged as a promising derivative of split learning well suited for distributed learning on resource-constrained devices. However, parallel split learning faces several challenges, such as large effective batch sizes, non-independent and identically distributed data, and the straggler effect. We view these issues as a sampling dilemma and propose to address them by orchestrating a mini-batch sampling process on the server side. We introduce a new method called uniform global sampling to decouple the effective batch size from the number of clients and reduce the mini-batch deviation. To address the straggler effect, we introduce a novel method called Latent Dirichlet Sampling, which generalizes uniform global sampling to balance the trade-off between batch deviation and training time. Our simulations reveal that our proposed methods enhance model accuracy by up to 34.1% in non-independent and identically distributed settings and reduce the training time in the presence of stragglers by up to 62%. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Sampling effectively mitigates the straggler effect without compromising model accuracy or adding significant computational overhead compared to uniform global sampling. Our results demonstrate the potential of our methods to mitigate common challenges in parallel split learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Valentin, Jinmiao Fu, Gianluca Detommaso, Shaoyuan Xu, Giovanni Zappella, Bryan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishub Tamirisa, Bhrugu Bharathi, Long Phan, Andy Zhou, Alice Gatti, Tarun Suresh, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Rowan Wang, Ron Arel, Andy Zou, Dawn Song, Bo Li, Dan Hendrycks, Mantas Mazeika</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiang You, Arben Cela, Ren\'e Natowicz, Jacob Ouanounou, Patrick Siarry</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is a critical challenge across various domains. Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting time series anomalies called Anomaly Prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qirui Jiao, Daoyuan Chen, Yilun Huang, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the proposed dataset to finetune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B, yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object removal" and conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity, quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on the synthesis of such a contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/ImgDiff.</p>
