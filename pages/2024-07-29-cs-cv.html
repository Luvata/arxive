<p><b>Authors:</b> Niels G. Faber, Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari, Fatemeh Karimi Najadasl</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a computer vision task that has been employed in a variety of sectors. Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of applying foundation models in knowledge</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zs\'ofia Katona, Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari, Fatemeh Karimi Najadasl</p>
<p>Abstract: Encounters between predator and prey play an essential role in ecosystems, but their rarity makes them difficult to detect in video recordings. Although advances in action recognition (AR) and temporal action detection (AD), especially transformer-based models and vision foundation models, have achieved high performance on human action datasets, animal videos remain relatively under-researched. This thesis addresses this gap by proposing the model MARINE, which utilizes motion-based frame selection designed for fast animal actions and DINOv2 feature extraction with a trainable classification head for action recognition. MARINE outperforms VideoMAE in identifying predator attacks in videos of fish, both on a small and specific coral reef dataset (81.53\% against 52.64\% accuracy), and on a subset of the more extensive Animal Kingdom dataset (94.86\% against 83.14\% accuracy). In a multi-label setting on a representative sample of Animal Kingdom, MARINE achieves 23.79\% mAP, positioning it mid-field among existing benchmarks. Furthermore, in an AD task on the coral reef dataset, MARINE achieves 80.78\% AP (against VideoMAE's 34.89\%) although at a lowered t-IoU threshold of 25\%. Therefore, despite room for improvement, MARINE offers an effective starter framework to apply to AR and AD tasks on animal recordings and thus contribute to the study of natural ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching Ting Leung, Yufan Chen, Hanyu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) systems aim to extract the molecular structure information, usually in the form of molecular graph or SMILES, from images of chemical molecules. While many tools have been developed for this purpose, challenges still exist due to different types of noises that might exist in the images. Specifically, we focus on the 'arrow-pushing' diagrams, a typical type of chemical images to demonstrate electron flow in mechanistic steps. We present Structural molecular identifier of Molecular images in Chemical Reaction Mechanisms (SMiCRM), a dataset designed to benchmark machine recognition capabilities of chemical molecules with arrow-pushing annotations. Comprising 453 images, it spans a broad array of organic chemical reactions, each illustrated with molecular structures and mechanistic arrows. SMiCRM offers a rich collection of annotated molecule images for enhancing the benchmarking process for OCSR methods. This dataset includes a machine-readable molecular identity for each image as well as mechanistic arrows showing electron flow during chemical reactions. It presents a more authentic and challenging task for testing molecular recognition technologies, and achieving this task can greatly enrich the mechanisitic information in computer-extracted chemical reaction data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Stella, Nicolas Talabot, Hieu Le, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting surfaces from Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) can be accomplished using traditional algorithms, such as Marching Cubes. However, since they rely on sign flips across the surface, these algorithms cannot be used directly on Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs). In this work, we introduce a deep-learning approach to taking a UDF and turning it locally into an SDF, so that it can be effectively triangulated using existing algorithms. We show that it achieves better accuracy in surface detection than existing methods. Furthermore it generalizes well to unseen shapes and datasets, while being parallelizable. We also demonstrate the flexibily of the method by using it in conjunction with DualMeshUDF, a state of the art dual meshing method that can operate on UDFs, improving its results and removing the need to tune its parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Pi, Mingyuan Wu, Jize Jiang, Haozhen Zheng, Beitong Tian, Chengxiang Zhai, Klara Nahrstedt, Zhiting Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Smaller-scale Vision-Langauge Models (VLMs) often claim to perform on par with larger models in general-domain visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks while offering advantages in computational efficiency and storage. However, their ability to handle rare objects, which fall into the long tail of data distributions, is less understood. To rigorously evaluate this aspect, we introduce the "Uncontextualized Uncommon Objects" (UOUO) benchmark. This benchmark focuses on systematically testing VLMs with both large and small parameter counts on rare and specialized objects. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that while smaller VLMs maintain competitive performance on common datasets, they significantly underperform on tasks involving uncommon objects. We also propose an advanced, scalable pipeline for data collection and cleaning, ensuring the UOUO benchmark provides high-quality, challenging instances. These findings highlight the need to consider long-tail distributions when assessing the true capabilities of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Kai Huang, Yutong Zheng, Yen-Shuo Su, Anudeepsekhar Bolimera, Han Zhang, Fangyi Chen, Marios Savvides</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial attribute editing plays a crucial role in synthesizing realistic faces with specific characteristics while maintaining realistic appearances. Despite advancements, challenges persist in achieving precise, 3D-aware attribute modifications, which are crucial for consistent and accurate representations of faces from different angles. Current methods struggle with semantic entanglement and lack effective guidance for incorporating attributes while maintaining image integrity. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that merges the strengths of latent-based and reference-based editing methods. Our approach employs a 3D GAN inversion technique to embed attributes from the reference image into a tri-plane space, ensuring 3D consistency and realistic viewing from multiple perspectives. We utilize blending techniques and predicted semantic masks to locate precise edit regions, merging them with the contextual guidance from the reference image. A coarse-to-fine inpainting strategy is then applied to preserve the integrity of untargeted areas, significantly enhancing realism. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance across diverse editing tasks, validating our framework's effectiveness in realistic and applicable facial attribute editing.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18437">Mixed Non-linear Quantization for Vision Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gihwan Kim, Jemin Lee, Sihyeong Park, Yongin Kwon, Hyungshin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of quantization methods have been proposed to reduce the model size of Vision Transformers, yet most of them have overlooked the quantization of non-linear operations. Only a few works have addressed quantization for non-linear operations, but they applied a single quantization method across all non-linear operations. We believe that this can be further improved by employing a different quantization method for each non-linear operation. Therefore, to assign the most error-minimizing quantization method from the known methods to each non-linear layer, we propose a mixed non-linear quantization that considers layer-wise quantization sensitivity measured by SQNR difference metric. The results show that our method outperforms I-BERT, FQ-ViT, and I-ViT in both 8-bit and 6-bit settings for ViT, DeiT, and Swin models by an average of 0.6%p and 19.6%p, respectively. Our method outperforms I-BERT and I-ViT by 0.6%p and 20.8%p, respectively, when training time is limited. We plan to release our code at https://gitlab.com/ones-ai/mixed-non-linear-quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Ganj, Hang Su, Tian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose HYBRIDDEPTH, a robust depth estimation pipeline that addresses the unique challenges of depth estimation for mobile AR, such as scale ambiguity, hardware heterogeneity, and generalizability. HYBRIDDEPTH leverages the camera features available on mobile devices. It effectively combines the scale accuracy inherent in Depth from Focus (DFF) methods with the generalization capabilities enabled by strong single-image depth priors. By utilizing the focal planes of a mobile camera, our approach accurately captures depth values from focused pixels and applies these values to compute scale and shift parameters for transforming relative depths into metric depths. We test our pipeline as an end-to-end system, with a newly developed mobile client to capture focal stacks, which are then sent to a GPU-powered server for depth estimation.
  Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that HYBRIDDEPTH not only outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in common datasets (DDFF12, NYU Depth v2) and a real-world AR dataset ARKitScenes but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization. For example, HYBRIDDEPTH trained on NYU Depth v2 achieves comparable performance on the DDFF12 to existing models trained on DDFF12. it also outperforms all the SOTA models in zero-shot performance on the ARKitScenes dataset. Additionally, we conduct a qualitative comparison between our model and the ARCore framework, demonstrating that our models output depth maps are significantly more accurate in terms of structural details and metric accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Briony Forsberg, Dr Henry Williams, Prof Bruce MacDonald, Tracy Chen, Dr Kirstine Hulse</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, state-of-the-art unsupervised detection models were evaluated for the purpose of automated anomaly inspection of wool carpets. A custom dataset of four unique types of carpet textures was created to thoroughly test the models and their robustness in detecting subtle anomalies in complex textures. Due to the requirements of an inline inspection system in a manufacturing use case, the metrics of importance in this study were accuracy in detecting anomalous areas, the number of false detections, and the inference times of each model for real-time performance. Of the evaluated models, the student-teacher network based methods were found on average to yield the highest detection accuracy and lowest false detection rates. When trained on a multi-class dataset the models were found to yield comparable if not better results than single-class training. Finally, in terms of detection speed, with exception to the generative model, all other evaluated models were found to have comparable inference times on a GPU, with an average of 0.16s per image. On a CPU, most of these models typically produced results between 1.5 to 2 times the respective GPU inference times.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18466">A Progressive Single-Modality to Multi-Modality Classification Framework for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Sub-type Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Liu, Mianxin Liu, Yuanwang Zhang, Kaicong Sun, Dinggang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The current clinical diagnosis framework of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves multiple modalities acquired from multiple diagnosis stages, each with distinct usage and cost. Previous AD diagnosis research has predominantly focused on how to directly fuse multiple modalities for an end-to-end one-stage diagnosis, which practically requires a high cost in data acquisition. Moreover, a significant part of these methods diagnose AD without considering clinical guideline and cannot offer accurate sub-type diagnosis. In this paper, by exploring inter-correlation among multiple modalities, we propose a novel progressive AD sub-type diagnosis framework, aiming to give diagnosis results based on easier-to-access modalities in earlier low-cost stages, instead of modalities from all stages. Specifically, first, we design 1) a text disentanglement network for better processing tabular data collected in the initial stage, and 2) a modality fusion module for fusing multi-modality features separately. Second, we align features from modalities acquired in earlier low-cost stage(s) with later high-cost stage(s) to give accurate diagnosis without actual modality acquisition in later-stage(s) for saving cost. Furthermore, we follow the clinical guideline to align features at each stage for achieving sub-type diagnosis. Third, we leverage a progressive classifier that can progressively include additional acquired modalities (if needed) for diagnosis, to achieve the balance between diagnosis cost and diagnosis performance. We evaluate our proposed framework on large diverse public and in-home datasets (8280 in total) and achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our codes will be released after the acceptance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18487">SMPISD-MTPNet: Scene Semantic Prior-Assisted Infrared Ship Detection Using Multi-Task Perception Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Hu, Xiaogang Dong, Yian Huang Lele Wang, Liang Xu, Tian Pu, Zhenming Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared ship detection (IRSD) has received increasing attention in recent years due to the robustness of infrared images to adverse weather. However, a large number of false alarms may occur in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the Scene Semantic Prior-Assisted Multi-Task Perception Network (SMPISD-MTPNet), which includes three stages: scene semantic extraction, deep feature extraction, and prediction. In the scene semantic extraction stage, we employ a Scene Semantic Extractor (SSE) to guide the network by the features extracted based on expert knowledge. In the deep feature extraction stage, a backbone network is employed to extract deep features. These features are subsequently integrated by a fusion network, enhancing the detection capabilities across targets of varying sizes. In the prediction stage, we utilize the Multi-Task Perception Module, which includes the Gradient-based Module and the Scene Segmentation Module, enabling precise detection of small and dim targets within complex scenes. For the training process, we introduce the Soft Fine-tuning training strategy to suppress the distortion caused by data augmentation. Besides, due to the lack of a publicly available dataset labelled for scenes, we introduce the Infrared Ship Dataset with Scene Segmentation (IRSDSS). Finally, we evaluate the network and compare it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicating that SMPISD-MTPNet outperforms existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Feng, Weiming Zeng, Yifan Xie, Hongyu Chen, Lei Wang, Yingying Wang, Hongjie Yan, Kaile Zhang, Ran Tao, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Although it has been noticed that depressed patients show differences in processing emotions, the precise neural modulation mechanisms of positive and negative emotions remain elusive. FMRI is a cutting-edge medical imaging technology renowned for its high spatial resolution and dynamic temporal information, making it particularly suitable for the neural dynamics of depression research. Methods: To address this gap, our study firstly leveraged fMRI to delineate activated regions associated with positive and negative emotions in healthy individuals, resulting in the creation of positive emotion atlas (PEA) and negative emotion atlas (NEA). Subsequently, we examined neuroimaging changes in depression patients using these atlases and evaluated their diagnostic performance based on machine learning. Results: Our findings demonstrate that the classification accuracy of depressed patients based on PEA and NEA exceeded 0.70, a notable improvement compared to the whole-brain atlases. Furthermore, ALFF analysis unveiled significant differences between depressed patients and healthy controls in eight functional clusters during the NEA, focusing on the left cuneus, cingulate gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. In contrast, the PEA revealed more pronounced differences across fifteen clusters, involving the right fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. Limitations: Due to the limited sample size and subtypes of depressed patients, the efficacy may need further validation in future. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the complex interplay between emotion modulation and depression, showcasing significant alterations in both PEA and NEA among depression patients. This research enhances our understanding of emotion modulation in depression, with implications for diagnosis and treatment evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Wang, Yunfan Lu, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing intensity frames from event data while maintaining high temporal resolution and dynamic range is crucial for bridging the gap between event-based and frame-based computer vision. Previous approaches have depended on supervised learning on synthetic data, which lacks interpretability and risk over-fitting to the setting of the event simulator. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) based methods, which primarily utilize per-frame optical flow to estimate intensity via photometric constancy, has been actively investigated. However, they are vulnerable to errors in the case of inaccurate optical flow. This paper proposes a novel SSL event-to-video reconstruction approach, dubbed EvINR, which eliminates the need for labeled data or optical flow estimation. Our core idea is to reconstruct intensity frames by directly addressing the event generation model, essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how events are generated based on the time-varying brightness signals. Specifically, we utilize an implicit neural representation (INR), which takes in spatiotemporal coordinate $(x, y, t)$ and predicts intensity values, to represent the solution of the event generation equation. The INR, parameterized as a fully-connected Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), can be optimized with its temporal derivatives supervised by events. To make EvINR feasible for online requisites, we propose several acceleration techniques that substantially expedite the training process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our EvINR surpasses previous SSL methods by 38% w.r.t. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and is comparable or superior to SoTA supervised methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18520">Text-Region Matching for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Missing Labels</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leilei Ma, Hongxing Xie, Lei Wang, Yanping Fu, Dengdi Sun, Haifeng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large-scale visual language pre-trained (VLP) models have demonstrated impressive performance across various downstream tasks. Motivated by these advancements, pioneering efforts have emerged in multi-label image recognition with missing labels, leveraging VLP prompt-tuning technology. However, they usually cannot match text and vision features well, due to complicated semantics gaps and missing labels in a multi-label image. To tackle this challenge, we propose \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}egion \textbf{M}atching for optimizing \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{L}abel prompt tuning, namely TRM-ML, a novel method for enhancing meaningful cross-modal matching. Compared to existing methods, we advocate exploring the information of category-aware regions rather than the entire image or pixels, which contributes to bridging the semantic gap between textual and visual representations in a one-to-one matching manner. Concurrently, we further introduce multimodal contrastive learning to narrow the semantic gap between textual and visual modalities and establish intra-class and inter-class relationships. Additionally, to deal with missing labels, we propose a multimodal category prototype that leverages intra- and inter-category semantic relationships to estimate unknown labels, facilitating pseudo-label generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longkun Zou, Wanru Zhu, Ke Chen, Lihua Guo, Kailing Guo, Kui Jia, Yaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic pattern of an object point cloud is determined by its topological configuration of local geometries. Learning discriminative representations can be challenging due to large shape variations of point sets in local regions and incomplete surface in a global perspective, which can be made even more severe in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). In specific, traditional 3D networks mainly focus on local geometric details and ignore the topological structure between local geometries, which greatly limits their cross-domain generalization. Recently, the transformer-based models have achieved impressive performance gain in a range of image-based tasks, benefiting from its strong generalization capability and scalability stemming from capturing long range correlation across local patches. Inspired by such successes of visual transformers, we propose a novel Relational Priors Distillation (RPD) method to extract relational priors from the well-trained transformers on massive images, which can significantly empower cross-domain representations with consistent topological priors of objects. To this end, we establish a parameter-frozen pre-trained transformer module shared between 2D teacher and 3D student models, complemented by an online knowledge distillation strategy for semantically regularizing the 3D student model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel self-supervised task centered on reconstructing masked point cloud patches using corresponding masked multi-view image features, thereby empowering the model with incorporating 3D geometric information. Experiments on the PointDA-10 and the Sim-to-Real datasets verify that the proposed method consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance of UDA for point cloud classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carolin Flosdorf, Justin Engelker, Igor Keller, Nicolas Mohr</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer detection still represents a major challenge in healthcare. Common detection methods can be lengthy and require human assistance which falls short in many countries. Previous research demonstrates how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can help effectively through both automation and an accuracy that is comparable to the human level. However, despite the progress in previous decades, the precision is still limited, leading to substantial misclassifications that have a serious impact on people's health. Hence, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) that has been developed in recent years based on the idea of a self-attention mechanism, specifically two configurations of a pre-trained ViT. We generally find superior metrics for classifying skin lesions after comparing them to base models such as decision tree classifier and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, as well as to CNNs and less complex ViTs. In particular, we attach greater importance to the performance of melanoma, which is the most lethal type of skin cancer. The ViT-L32 model achieves an accuracy of 91.57% and a melanoma recall of 58.54%, while ViT-L16 achieves an accuracy of 92.79% and a melanoma recall of 56.10%. This offers a potential tool for faster and more accurate diagnoses and an overall improvement for the healthcare sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Shi, Minjing Dong, Mingjia Li, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have significantly advanced the field of computer vision, offering robust modeling capabilities and global receptive field. However, their high computational demands limit their applicability in processing long sequences. To tackle this issue, State Space Models (SSMs) have gained prominence in vision tasks as they offer linear computational complexity. Recently, State Space Duality (SSD), an improved variant of SSMs, was introduced in Mamba2 to enhance model performance and efficiency. However, the inherent causal nature of SSD/SSMs restricts their applications in non-causal vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Visual State Space Duality (VSSD) model, which has a non-causal format of SSD. Specifically, we propose to discard the magnitude of interactions between the hidden state and tokens while preserving their relative weights, which relieves the dependencies of token contribution on previous tokens. Together with the involvement of multi-scan strategies, we show that the scanning results can be integrated to achieve non-causality, which not only improves the performance of SSD in vision tasks but also enhances its efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks including image classification, detection, and segmentation, where VSSD surpasses existing state-of-the-art SSM-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjun Yi, Qi Bi, Hao Zheng, Haolan Zhan, Wei Ji, Yawen Huang, Yuexiang Li, Yefeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Vision Foundation Model (VFM) brings inherent out-domain generalization for a variety of down-stream tasks. Among them, domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) holds unique challenges as the cross-domain images share common pixel-wise content information but vary greatly in terms of the style. In this paper, we present a novel Spectral-dEcomposed Token (SET) learning framework to advance the frontier. Delving into further than existing fine-tuning token & frozen backbone paradigm, the proposed SET especially focuses on the way learning style-invariant features from these learnable tokens. Particularly, the frozen VFM features are first decomposed into the phase and amplitude components in the frequency space, which mainly contain the information of content and style, respectively, and then separately processed by learnable tokens for task-specific information extraction. After the decomposition, style variation primarily impacts the token-based feature enhancement within the amplitude branch. To address this issue, we further develop an attention optimization method to bridge the gap between style-affected representation and static tokens during inference. Extensive cross-domain experiments show its state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In Cho, Hyunbo Shim, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to facilitate more practical NLOS imaging by reducing the number of samplings and scan areas. To this end, we introduce a phasor-based enhancement network that is capable of predicting clean and full measurements from noisy partial observations. We leverage a denoising autoencoder scheme to acquire rich and noise-robust representations in the measurement space. Through this pipeline, our enhancement network is trained to accurately reconstruct complete measurements from their corrupted and partial counterparts. However, we observe that the \naive application of denoising often yields degraded and over-smoothed results, caused by unnecessary and spurious frequency signals present in measurements. To address this issue, we introduce a phasor-based pipeline designed to limit the spectrum of our network to the frequency range of interests, where the majority of informative signals are detected. The phasor wavefronts at the aperture, which are band-limited signals, are employed as inputs and outputs of the network, guiding our network to learn from the frequency range of interests and discard unnecessary information. The experimental results in more practical acquisition scenarios demonstrate that we can look around the corners with $16\times$ or $64\times$ fewer samplings and $4\times$ smaller apertures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zequn Zeng, Jianqiao Sun, Hao Zhang, Tiansheng Wen, Yudi Su, Yan Xie, Zhengjue Wang, Bo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning evaluation metrics can be divided into two categories, reference-based metrics and reference-free metrics. However, reference-based approaches may struggle to evaluate descriptive captions with abundant visual details produced by advanced multimodal large language models, due to their heavy reliance on limited human-annotated references. In contrast, previous reference-free metrics have been proven effective via CLIP cross-modality similarity. Nonetheless, CLIP-based metrics, constrained by their solution of global image-text compatibility, often have a deficiency in detecting local textual hallucinations and are insensitive to small visual objects. Besides, their single-scale designs are unable to provide an interpretable evaluation process such as pinpointing the position of caption mistakes and identifying visual regions that have not been described. To move forward, we propose a novel reference-free metric for image captioning evaluation, dubbed Hierarchical Image Captioning Evaluation Score (HICE-S). By detecting local visual regions and textual phrases, HICE-S builds an interpretable hierarchical scoring mechanism, breaking through the barriers of the single-scale structure of existing reference-free metrics. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our proposed metric achieves the SOTA performance on several benchmarks, outperforming existing reference-free metrics like CLIP-S and PAC-S, and reference-based metrics like METEOR and CIDEr. Moreover, several case studies reveal that the assessment process of HICE-S on detailed captions closely resembles interpretable human judgments.Our code is available at https://github.com/joeyz0z/HICE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research in 3D mapping is crucial for smart city applications, yet the cost of acquiring 3D data often hinders progress. Visual localization, particularly monocular camera position estimation, offers a solution by determining the camera's pose solely through visual cues. However, this task is challenging due to limited data from a single camera. To tackle these challenges, we organized the AISG-SLA Visual Localization Challenge (VLC) at IJCAI 2023 to explore how AI can accurately extract camera pose data from 2D images in 3D space. The challenge attracted over 300 participants worldwide, forming 50+ teams. Winning teams achieved high accuracy in pose estimation using images from a car-mounted camera with low frame rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyan Bai, Tingfa Xu, Huan Chen, Peifu Liu, Jianan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting discriminative information from complex spectral details in hyperspectral image (HSI) for HSI classification is pivotal. While current prevailing methods rely on spectral magnitude features, they could cause confusion in certain classes, resulting in misclassification and decreased accuracy. We find that the derivative spectrum proves more adept at capturing concealed information, thereby offering a distinct advantage in separating these confusion classes. Leveraging the complementarity between spectral magnitude and derivative features, we propose a Content-driven Spectrum Complementary Network based on Magnitude-Derivative Dual Encoder, employing these two features as combined inputs. To fully utilize their complementary information, we raise a Content-adaptive Point-wise Fusion Module, enabling adaptive fusion of dual-encoder features in a point-wise selective manner, contingent upon feature representation. To preserve a rich source of complementary information while extracting more distinguishable features, we introduce a Hybrid Disparity-enhancing Loss that enhances the differential expression of the features from the two branches and increases the inter-class distance. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the extensive WHU-OHS dataset and eight other benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study delves into the intricacies of synchronizing facial dynamics with multilingual audio inputs, focusing on the creation of visually compelling, time-synchronized animations through diffusion-based techniques. Diverging from traditional parametric models for facial animation, our approach, termed LinguaLinker, adopts a holistic diffusion-based framework that integrates audio-driven visual synthesis to enhance the synergy between auditory stimuli and visual responses. We process audio features separately and derive the corresponding control gates, which implicitly govern the movements in the mouth, eyes, and head, irrespective of the portrait's origin. The advanced audio-driven visual synthesis mechanism provides nuanced control but keeps the compatibility of output video and input audio, allowing for a more tailored and effective portrayal of distinct personas across different languages. The significant improvements in the fidelity of animated portraits, the accuracy of lip-syncing, and the appropriate motion variations achieved by our method render it a versatile tool for animating any portrait in any language.</p>

In this paper, we propose a new NeRF framework method to address these issues. Our method uses image content and pose data to iteratively plan the next best view. A crucial aspect of this method involves uncertainty estimation, guiding the selection of views with maximum information gain from a candidate set. This iterative process enhances rendering quality over time. Simultaneously, we introduce the Vonoroi diagram and threshold sampling together with flight classifier to boost the efficiency, while keep the original NeRF network intact.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangwei Hao, Jiesheng Wu, Ji Du, Yinjie Wang, Jing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration is a long-standing task that seeks to recover the latent sharp image from its deteriorated counterpart. Due to the robust capacity of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods or some attention-based convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results on many image restoration tasks in recent years. However, existing attention modules encounters limited receptive fields or abundant parameters. In order to integrate contextual information more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose a dilated strip attention network (DSAN) for image restoration. Specifically, to gather more contextual information for each pixel from its neighboring pixels in the same row or column, a dilated strip attention (DSA) mechanism is elaborately proposed. By employing the DSA operation horizontally and vertically, each location can harvest the contextual information from a much wider region. In addition, we utilize multi-scale receptive fields across different feature groups in DSA to improve representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our DSAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several image restoration tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amid the proliferation of forged images, notably the tsunami of deepfake content, extensive research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify forged content in the face of continuing advancements in counterfeiting technologies. We have investigated the use of AI to provide the original authentic image after deepfake detection, which we believe is a reliable and persuasive solution. We call this "image-based automated fact verification," a name that originated from a text-based fact-checking system used by journalists. We have developed a two-phase open framework that integrates detection and retrieval components. Additionally, inspired by a dataset proposed by Meta Fundamental AI Research, we further constructed a large-scale dataset that is specifically designed for this task. This dataset simulates real-world conditions and includes both content-preserving and content-aware manipulations that present a range of difficulty levels and have potential for ongoing research. This multi-task dataset is fully annotated, enabling it to be utilized for sub-tasks within the forgery identification and fact retrieval domains. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) We introduce a new task, "image-based automated fact verification," and present a novel two-phase open framework combining "forgery identification" and "fact retrieval." (2) We present a large-scale dataset tailored for this new task that features various hand-crafted image edits and machine learning-driven manipulations, with extensive annotations suitable for various sub-tasks. Extensive experimental results validate its practicality for fact verification research and clarify its difficulty levels for various sub-tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-set text recognition, which aims to address both novel characters and previously seen ones, is one of the rising subtopics in the text recognition field. However, the current open-set text recognition solutions only focuses on horizontal text, which fail to model the real-life challenges posed by the variety of writing directions in real-world scene text. Multi-orientation text recognition, in general, faces challenges from the diverse image aspect ratios, significant imbalance in data amount, and domain gaps between orientations. In this work, we first propose a Multi-Oriented Open-Set Text Recognition task (MOOSTR) to model the challenges of both novel characters and writing direction variety. We then propose a Multi-Orientation Sharing Experts (MOoSE) framework as a strong baseline solution. MOoSE uses a mixture-of-experts scheme to alleviate the domain gaps between orientations, while exploiting common structural knowledge among experts to alleviate the data scarcity that some experts face. The proposed MOoSE framework is validated by ablative experiments, and also tested for feasibility on the existing open-set benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Cai, Zhiwei Liu, Guibo Zhu, Yunfang Niu, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pixel-level fine-grained image editing remains an open challenge. Previous works fail to achieve an ideal trade-off between control granularity and inference speed. They either fail to achieve pixel-level fine-grained control, or their inference speed requires optimization. To address this, this paper for the first time employs a regression-based network to learn the variation patterns of StyleGAN latent codes during the image dragging process. This method enables pixel-level precision in dragging editing with little time cost. Users can specify handle points and their corresponding target points on any GAN-generated images, and our method will move each handle point to its corresponding target point. Through experimental analysis, we discover that a short movement distance from handle points to target points yields a high-fidelity edited image, as the model only needs to predict the movement of a small portion of pixels. To achieve this, we decompose the entire movement process into multiple sub-processes. Specifically, we develop a transformer encoder-decoder based network named 'Latent Predictor' to predict the latent code motion trajectories from handle points to target points in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, to enhance the prediction stability, we introduce a component named 'Latent Regularizer', aimed at constraining the latent code motion within the distribution of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference speed and image editing performance at the pixel-level granularity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daewon Choi, Jongheon Jeong, Huiwon Jang, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness has been conventionally believed as a challenging property to encode for neural networks, requiring plenty of training data. In the recent paradigm of adopting off-the-shelf models, however, access to their training data is often infeasible or not practical, while most of such models are not originally trained concerning adversarial robustness. In this paper, we develop a scalable and model-agnostic solution to achieve adversarial robustness without using any data. Our intuition is to view recent text-to-image diffusion models as "adaptable" denoisers that can be optimized to specify target tasks. Based on this, we propose: (a) to initiate a denoise-and-classify pipeline that offers provable guarantees against adversarial attacks, and (b) to leverage a few synthetic reference images generated from the text-to-image model that enables novel adaptation schemes. Our experiments show that our data-free scheme applied to the pre-trained CLIP could improve the (provable) adversarial robustness of its diverse zero-shot classification derivatives (while maintaining their accuracy), significantly surpassing prior approaches that utilize the full training data. Not only for CLIP, we also demonstrate that our framework is easily applicable for robustifying other visual classifiers efficiently.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of image data has led to the development of advanced image processing and computer vision techniques, which are crucial in various applications such as image classification, image segmentation, and pattern recognition. Texture is an important feature that has been widely used in many image processing tasks. Therefore, analyzing and understanding texture plays a pivotal role in image analysis and understanding.Local binary pattern (LBP) is a powerful operator that describes the local texture features of images. This paper provides a novel mathematical representation of the LBP by separating the operator into three matrices, two of which are always fixed and do not depend on the input data. These fixed matrices are analyzed in depth, and a new algorithm is proposed to optimize them for improved classification performance. The optimization process is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. As a result, the authors present optimal LBPs that effectively describe the texture of human face images. Several experiment results presented in this paper convincingly verify the efficiency and superiority of the optimized LBPs for face detection and facial expression recognition tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ultrasound imaging reveals eye morphology and aids in diagnosing and treating eye diseases. However, interpreting diagnostic reports requires specialized physicians. We present a labeled ophthalmic dataset for the precise analysis and the automated exploration of medical images along with their associated reports. It collects three modal data, including the ultrasound images, blood flow information and examination reports from 2,417 patients at an ophthalmology hospital in Shenyang, China, during the year 2018, in which the patient information is de-identified for privacy protection. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only ophthalmic dataset that contains the three modal information simultaneously. It incrementally consists of 4,858 images with the corresponding free-text reports, which describe 15 typical imaging findings of intraocular diseases and the corresponding anatomical locations. Each image shows three kinds of blood flow indices at three specific arteries, i.e., nine parameter values to describe the spectral characteristics of blood flow distribution. The reports were written by ophthalmologists during the clinical care. The proposed dataset is applied to generate medical report based on the cross-modal deep learning model. The experimental results demonstrate that our dataset is suitable for training supervised models concerning cross-modal medical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao D. Nunes, Diana Montezuma, Domingos Oliveira, Tania Pereira, Jaime S. Cardoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Manually annotating nuclei from the gigapixel Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is a laborious and costly task, meaning automated algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification could alleviate the workload of pathologists and clinical researchers and at the same time facilitate the automatic extraction of clinically interpretable features. But due to high intra- and inter-class variability of nuclei morphological and chromatic features, as well as H&E-stains susceptibility to artefacts, state-of-the-art algorithms cannot correctly detect and classify instances with the necessary performance. In this work, we hypothesise context and attention inductive biases in artificial neural networks (ANNs) could increase the generalization of algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification. We conduct a thorough survey on context and attention methods for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification from H&E-stained microscopy imaging, while providing a comprehensive discussion of the challenges being tackled with context and attention. Besides, we illustrate some limitations of current approaches and present ideas for future research. As a case study, we extend both a general instance segmentation and classification method (Mask-RCNN) and a tailored cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification model (HoVer-Net) with context- and attention-based mechanisms, and do a comparative analysis on a multi-centre colon nuclei identification and counting dataset. Although pathologists rely on context at multiple levels while paying attention to specific Regions of Interest (RoIs) when analysing and annotating WSIs, our findings suggest translating that domain knowledge into algorithm design is no trivial task, but to fully exploit these mechanisms, the scientific understanding of these methods should be addressed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohyeong Kim, Martin Danelljan, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool, Jean-Philippe Thiran</p>
<p>Abstract: The modern approaches for computer vision tasks significantly rely on machine learning, which requires a large number of quality images. While there is a plethora of image datasets with a single type of images, there is a lack of datasets collected from multiple cameras. In this thesis, we introduce Paired Image and Video data from three CAMeraS, namely PIV3CAMS, aimed at multiple computer vision tasks. The PIV3CAMS dataset consists of 8385 pairs of images and 82 pairs of videos taken from three different cameras: Canon D5 Mark IV, Huawei P20, and ZED stereo camera. The dataset includes various indoor and outdoor scenes from different locations in Zurich (Switzerland) and Cheonan (South Korea). Some of the computer vision applications that can benefit from the PIV3CAMS dataset are image/video enhancement, view interpolation, image matching, and much more. We provide a careful explanation of the data collection process and detailed analysis of the data. The second part of this thesis studies the usage of depth information in the view synthesizing task. In addition to the regeneration of a current state-of-the-art algorithm, we investigate several proposed alternative models that integrate depth information geometrically. Through extensive experiments, we show that the effect of depth is crucial in small view changes. Finally, we apply our model to the introduced PIV3CAMS dataset to synthesize novel target views as an example application of PIV3CAMS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Hao, Xiaobing Wang, Yingying Jiang, Hanchao Jia, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging task due to its compositional property. Previous approaches improve prediction efficiency by learning in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods exhibit limited performance as they assume unidirectional conditioning between entities and predicates, leading to insufficient information interaction. To address this limitation, we propose a novel bidirectional conditioning factorization for SGG, introducing efficient interaction between entities and predicates. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end scene graph generation model, Bidirectional Conditioning Transformer (BCTR), to implement our factorization. BCTR consists of two key modules. First, the Bidirectional Conditioning Generator (BCG) facilitates multi-stage interactive feature augmentation between entities and predicates, enabling mutual benefits between the two predictions. Second, Random Feature Alignment (RFA) regularizes the feature space by distilling multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained models, enhancing BCTR's ability on tailed categories without relying on statistical priors. We conduct a series of experiments on Visual Genome and Open Image V6, demonstrating that BCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. The code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah M\"uller, Louisa Fay, Lisa M. Koch, Sergios Gatidis, Thomas K\"ustner, Philipp Berens</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging cohorts are often confounded by factors such as acquisition devices, hospital sites, patient backgrounds, and many more. As a result, deep learning models tend to learn spurious correlations instead of causally related features, limiting their generalizability to new and unseen data. This problem can be addressed by minimizing dependence measures between intermediate representations of task-related and non-task-related variables. These measures include mutual information, distance correlation, and the performance of adversarial classifiers. Here, we benchmark such dependence measures for the task of preventing shortcut learning. We study a simplified setting using Morpho-MNIST and a medical imaging task with CheXpert chest radiographs. Our results provide insights into how to mitigate confounding factors in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abiodun Finbarrs Oketunji</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the application of deep residual networks for predicting the dynamics of interacting three-dimensional rigid bodies. We present a framework combining a 3D physics simulator implemented in C++ with a deep learning model constructed using PyTorch. The simulator generates training data encompassing linear and angular motion, elastic collisions, fluid friction, gravitational effects, and damping. Our deep residual network, consisting of an input layer, multiple residual blocks, and an output layer, is designed to handle the complexities of 3D dynamics. We evaluate the network's performance using a datasetof 10,000 simulated scenarios, each involving 3-5 interacting rigid bodies. The model achieves a mean squared error of 0.015 for position predictions and 0.022 for orientation predictions, representing a 25% improvement over baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the network's ability to capture intricate physical interactions, with particular success in predicting elastic collisions and rotational dynamics. This work significantly contributes to physics-informed machine learning by showcasing the immense potential of deep residual networks in modeling complex 3D physical systems. We discuss our approach's limitations and propose future directions for improving generalization to more diverse object shapes and materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhao Zhu, Venkatesh Saligrama</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Deep Companion Learning (DCL), a novel training method for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that enhances generalization by penalizing inconsistent model predictions compared to its historical performance. To achieve this, we train a deep-companion model (DCM), by using previous versions of the model to provide forecasts on new inputs. This companion model deciphers a meaningful latent semantic structure within the data, thereby providing targeted supervision that encourages the primary model to address the scenarios it finds most challenging. We validate our approach through both theoretical analysis and extensive experimentation, including ablation studies, on a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K) using diverse architectural models (ShuffleNetV2, ResNet, Vision Transformer, etc.), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhat Le, Khoa Do, Xuan Bui, Tuong Do, Erman Tjiputra, Quang D. Tran, Anh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating group dance motion from the music is a challenging task with several industrial applications. Although several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, most of them prioritize optimizing the fidelity in dancing movement, constrained by predetermined dancer counts in datasets. This limitation impedes adaptability to real-world applications. Our study addresses the scalability problem in group choreography while preserving naturalness and synchronization. In particular, we propose a phase-based variational generative model for group dance generation on learning a generative manifold. Our method achieves high-fidelity group dance motion and enables the generation with an unlimited number of dancers while consuming only a minimal and constant amount of memory. The intensive experiments on two public datasets show that our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin and is scalable to a great number of dancers beyond the training data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18854">Unifying Visual and Semantic Feature Spaces with Diffusion Models for Enhanced Cross-Modal Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze Zheng, Zixuan Li, Xiangxian Li, Jinxing Liu, Yuqing Wang, Xiangxu Meng, Lei Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification models often demonstrate unstable performance in real-world applications due to variations in image information, driven by differing visual perspectives of subject objects and lighting discrepancies. To mitigate these challenges, existing studies commonly incorporate additional modal information matching the visual data to regularize the model's learning process, enabling the extraction of high-quality visual features from complex image regions. Specifically, in the realm of multimodal learning, cross-modal alignment is recognized as an effective strategy, harmonizing different modal information by learning a domain-consistent latent feature space for visual and semantic features. However, this approach may face limitations due to the heterogeneity between multimodal information, such as differences in feature distribution and structure. To address this issue, we introduce a Multimodal Alignment and Reconstruction Network (MARNet), designed to enhance the model's resistance to visual noise. Importantly, MARNet includes a cross-modal diffusion reconstruction module for smoothly and stably blending information across different domains. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, Vireo-Food172 and Ingredient-101, demonstrate that MARNet effectively improves the quality of image information extracted by the model. It is a plug-and-play framework that can be rapidly integrated into various image classification frameworks, boosting model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyao Lyu, Tianxiang Hao, Xinhao Xu, Hui Chen, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) facilitates knowledge transfer from a source domain to a related target domain. This paper investigates a practical DA paradigm, namely Source data-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA), where source data becomes inaccessible during adaptation, and a minimum amount of annotation budget is available in the target domain. Without referencing the source data, new challenges emerge in identifying the most informative target samples for labeling, establishing cross-domain alignment during adaptation, and ensuring continuous performance improvements through the iterative query-and-adaptation process. In response, we present learn from the learnt (LFTL), a novel paradigm for SFADA to leverage the learnt knowledge from the source pretrained model and actively iterated models without extra overhead. We propose Contrastive Active Sampling to learn from the hypotheses of the preceding model, thereby querying target samples that are both informative to the current model and persistently challenging throughout active learning. During adaptation, we learn from features of actively selected anchors obtained from previous intermediate models, so that the Visual Persistence-guided Adaptation can facilitate feature distribution alignment and active sample exploitation. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks show that our LFTL achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior computational efficiency and continuous improvements as the annotation budget increases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sparsh Gupta, Debanjan Konar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling the capture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across the input, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations that focus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically require computing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading to quadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computational and memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problems can be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalable non-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network (QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies on inherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a large number of input features enabling more efficient computations in quantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships through quantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantum counterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. The simulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levels in binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewer qubits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Shtedritski, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Canonical surface mapping generalizes keypoint detection by assigning each pixel of an object to a corresponding point in a 3D template. Popularised by DensePose for the analysis of humans, authors have since attempted to apply the concept to more categories, but with limited success due to the high cost of manual supervision. In this work, we introduce SHIC, a method to learn canonical maps without manual supervision which achieves better results than supervised methods for most categories. Our idea is to leverage foundation computer vision models such as DINO and Stable Diffusion that are open-ended and thus possess excellent priors over natural categories. SHIC reduces the problem of estimating image-to-template correspondences to predicting image-to-image correspondences using features from the foundation models. The reduction works by matching images of the object to non-photorealistic renders of the template, which emulates the process of collecting manual annotations for this task. These correspondences are then used to supervise high-quality canonical maps for any object of interest. We also show that image generators can further improve the realism of the template views, which provide an additional source of supervision for the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Man, Yichen Sheng, Jianming Zhang, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object reconstruction from single images have primarily focused on improving the accuracy of object shapes. Yet, these techniques often fail to accurately capture the inter-relation between the object, ground, and camera. As a result, the reconstructed objects often appear floating or tilted when placed on flat surfaces. This limitation significantly affects 3D-aware image editing applications like shadow rendering and object pose manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce ORG (Object Reconstruction with Ground), a novel task aimed at reconstructing 3D object geometry in conjunction with the ground surface. Our method uses two compact pixel-level representations to depict the relationship between camera, object, and ground. Experiments show that the proposed ORG model can effectively reconstruct object-ground geometry on unseen data, significantly enhancing the quality of shadow generation and pose manipulation compared to conventional single-image 3D reconstruction techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for retinal feature point alignment, designed for learning cross-modality features to enhance matching and registration across multi-modality retinal images. Our model draws on the success of previous learning-based feature detection and description methods. To better leverage unlabeled data and constrain the model to reproduce relevant keypoints, we integrate a keypoint-based segmentation task. It is trained in a self-supervised manner by enforcing segmentation consistency between different augmentations of the same image. By incorporating a keypoint augmented self-supervised layer, we achieve robust feature extraction across modalities. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets and one in-house dataset demonstrates significant improvements in performance for modality-agnostic retinal feature alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas R. A. Wilde</p>
<p>Abstract: The article presents some current observations (as of April 10, 2024) on the integration of AI-generated images within processes of media convergence. It draws on two different concepts of intermediality. Primary intermediality concepts are motivated by the object when a new type of technology develops the potential to become socially relevant as a media form and thus a socially, politically, or culturally important communicative factor. Due to their uncertain 'measurements' within the wider media ecology, however, the new, still potential media form appears hybrid. The "inter-" or "between-" of this initial intermediality moment thus refers to the questionable "site" and the questionable description of the potential media form between already existing technologies and cultural forms and their conceptual measurements. For secondary concepts of intermediality, in contrast, it can be assumed that the boundaries of media forms and their application have already been drawn and are reasonably undisputed. This then raises the question of intentional and staged references to AI imagery within other media forms and pictures. The article discusses indicators of both intermediality moments using current examples and controversies surrounding AI images. The thesis is that there can be no talk of a seamless 'integration' of AI images into the wider media landscape at the moment (within films, comic books, or video games, for example) - as one of countless other image production techniques - and that the medial 'site' of AI image circulation - at least where it is not a matter of deception, but rather their conscious use as AI images - especially in social media communication and in fan cultures, but with repercussions for the more general media ecology and image interpretation, insofar as the suspicion that an image could be AI-generated is now increasingly present as a "hermeneutics of suspicion".</p>

<p>Abstract: Moving from animal models to human applications in preclinical research encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines in medical science. A fundamental element in the development of new drugs, treatments, diagnostic methods, and in deepening our understanding of disease processes is the accurate measurement of kidney tissues. Past studies have demonstrated the viability of translating glomeruli segmentation techniques from mouse models to human applications. Yet, these investigations tend to neglect the complexities involved in segmenting pathological glomeruli affected by different lesions. Such lesions present a wider range of morphological variations compared to healthy glomerular tissue, which are arguably more valuable than normal glomeruli in clinical practice. Furthermore, data on lesions from animal models can be more readily scaled up from disease models and whole kidney biopsies. This brings up a question: ``\textit{Can a pathological segmentation model trained on mouse models be effectively applied to human patients?}" To answer this question, we introduced GLAM, a deep learning study for fine-grained segmentation of human kidney lesions using a mouse model, addressing mouse-to-human transfer learning, by evaluating different learning strategies for segmenting human pathological lesions using zero-shot transfer learning and hybrid learning by leveraging mouse samples. From the results, the hybrid learning model achieved superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gina Wong, Joshua Gleason, Rama Chellappa, Yoav Wald, Anqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning models whose predictions are invariant under multiple environments is a promising approach for out-of-distribution generalization. Such models are trained to extract features $X_{\text{inv}}$ where the conditional distribution $Y \mid X_{\text{inv}}$ of the label given the extracted features does not change across environments. Invariant models are also supposed to generalize to shifts in the marginal distribution $p(X_{\text{inv}})$ of the extracted features $X_{\text{inv}}$, a type of shift we call an $\textit{invariant covariate shift}$. However, we show that proposed methods for learning invariant models underperform under invariant covariate shift, either failing to learn invariant models$\unicode{x2014}$even for data generated from simple and well-studied linear-Gaussian models$\unicode{x2014}$or having poor finite-sample performance. To alleviate these problems, we propose $\textit{weighted risk invariance}$ (WRI). Our framework is based on imposing invariance of the loss across environments subject to appropriate reweightings of the training examples. We show that WRI provably learns invariant models, i.e. discards spurious correlations, in linear-Gaussian settings. We propose a practical algorithm to implement WRI by learning the density $p(X_{\text{inv}})$ and the model parameters simultaneously, and we demonstrate empirically that WRI outperforms previous invariant learning methods under invariant covariate shift.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H\&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoqing Chen, Jiawei Sun, Xinyi Ye, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</p>

Grounded in Griselda Pollock's theories on visual culture and gender, the analysis reveals that AI models tend to sexualize female figures while portraying male figures as more authoritative and competent. These findings underscore AI's potential to mirror and perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing the need for critical engagement with AI-generated content. The project contributes to discussions on the ethical implications of AI in creative practices and its broader impact on cultural perceptions of gender.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joe Dhanith P R, Shravan Venkatraman, Vigya Sharma, Santhosh Malarvannan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Toosi, Sara Harsini, Fran\c{c}ois B\'enard, Carlos Uribe, Arman Rahmim</p>
<p>Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Shi, Jiawei Liu, Yinpeng Liu, Qikai Cheng, Wei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles a key issue in the interpretation of scientific figures: the fine-grained alignment of text and figures. It advances beyond prior research that primarily dealt with straightforward, data-driven visualizations such as bar and pie charts and only offered a basic understanding of diagrams through captioning and classification. We introduce a novel task, Figure Integrity Verification, designed to evaluate the precision of technologies in aligning textual knowledge with visual elements in scientific figures. To support this, we develop a semi-automated method for constructing a large-scale dataset, Figure-seg, specifically designed for this task. Additionally, we propose an innovative framework, Every Part Matters (EPM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to not only incrementally improve the alignment and verification of text-figure integrity but also enhance integrity through analogical reasoning. Our comprehensive experiments show that these innovations substantially improve upon existing methods, allowing for more precise and thorough analysis of complex scientific figures. This progress not only enhances our understanding of multimodal technologies but also stimulates further research and practical applications across fields requiring the accurate interpretation of complex visual data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Wolf, a WOrLd summarization Framework for accurate video captioning. Wolf is an automated captioning framework that adopts a mixture-of-experts approach, leveraging complementary strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs). By utilizing both image and video models, our framework captures different levels of information and summarizes them efficiently. Our approach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, and captioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-based metric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets in three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community (VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V). For instance, in comparison with GPT-4V, Wolf improves CapScore both quality-wise by 55.6% and similarity-wise by 77.4% on challenging driving videos. Finally, we establish a benchmark for video captioning and introduce a leaderboard, aiming to accelerate advancements in video understanding, captioning, and data alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Kumar Srirama, Sudeep Dasari, Shikhar Bahl, Abhinav Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to *generalize* to various tasks in the wild, robotic agents will need a suitable representation (i.e., vision network) that enables the robot to predict optimal actions given high dimensional vision inputs. However, learning such a representation requires an extreme amount of diverse training data, which is prohibitively expensive to collect on a real robot. How can we overcome this problem? Instead of collecting more robot data, this paper proposes using internet-scale, human videos to extract "affordances," both at the environment and agent level, and distill them into a pre-trained representation. We present a simple framework for pre-training representations on hand, object, and contact "affordance labels" that highlight relevant objects in images and how to interact with them. These affordances are automatically extracted from human video data (with the help of off-the-shelf computer vision modules) and used to fine-tune existing representations. Our approach can efficiently fine-tune *any* existing representation, and results in models with stronger downstream robotic performance across the board. We experimentally demonstrate (using 3000+ robot trials) that this affordance pre-training scheme boosts performance by a minimum of 15% on 5 real-world tasks, which consider three diverse robot morphologies (including a dexterous hand). Unlike prior works in the space, these representations improve performance across 3 different camera views. Quantitatively, we find that our approach leads to higher levels of generalization in out-of-distribution settings. For code, weights, and data check: https://hrp-robot.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has potential to automate screening, monitoring and grading of disease in medical images. Pretraining with contrastive learning enables models to extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets, facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the direct application of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introduces two domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which have been shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translate from the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumption made by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, is systematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy and disease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedly image the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time. In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastive frameworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widely available patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-image contrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experiments using two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal OCT images of 7,912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate the utility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of disease progression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms both standard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five out of six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. Due to its modularity, our method can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potential benefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yabin Zhang, Jiehong Lin, Ruihuang Li, Kui Jia, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked autoencoder has demonstrated its effectiveness in self-supervised point cloud learning. Considering that masking is a kind of corruption, in this work we explore a more general denoising autoencoder for point cloud learning (Point-DAE) by investigating more types of corruptions beyond masking. Specifically, we degrade the point cloud with certain corruptions as input, and learn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the original point cloud from its corrupted version. Three corruption families (\ie, density/masking, noise, and affine transformation) and a total of fourteen corruption types are investigated with traditional non-Transformer encoders. Besides the popular masking corruption, we identify another effective corruption family, \ie, affine transformation. The affine transformation disturbs all points globally, which is complementary to the masking corruption where some local regions are dropped. We also validate the effectiveness of affine transformation corruption with the Transformer backbones, where we decompose the reconstruction of the complete point cloud into the reconstructions of detailed local patches and rough global shape, alleviating the position leakage problem in the reconstruction. Extensive experiments on tasks of object classification, few-shot learning, robustness testing, part segmentation, and 3D object detection validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p>Abstract: The use of deep learning methods for automatic detection of students' classroom behavior is a promising approach to analyze their class performance and enhance teaching effectiveness. However, the lack of publicly available datasets on student behavior poses a challenge for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we propose a Student Classroom Behavior dataset (SCB-dataset) that reflects real-life scenarios. Our dataset includes 11,248 labels and 4,003 images, with a focus on hand-raising behavior. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv7 algorithm, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 85.3%. We believe that our dataset can serve as a robust foundation for future research in the field of student behavior detection and promote further advancements in this area.Our SCB-dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset</p>

<p>Abstract: Thousands of users consult digital archives daily, but the information they can access is unrepresentative of the diversity of documentary history. The sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for optical character recognition (OCR) - which jointly learns a vision and language model - is poorly extensible to low-resource document collections, as learning a language-vision model requires extensive labeled sequences and compute. This study models OCR as a character level image retrieval problem, using a contrastively trained vision encoder. Because the model only learns characters' visual features, it is more sample efficient and extensible than existing architectures, enabling accurate OCR in settings where existing solutions fail. Crucially, the model opens new avenues for community engagement in making digital history more representative of documentary history.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Burgess, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate impressive and realistic images, but do they learn to represent the 3D world from only 2D supervision? We demonstrate that yes, certain 3D scene representations are encoded in the text embedding space of models like Stable Diffusion. Our approach, Viewpoint Neural Textual Inversion (ViewNeTI), is to discover 3D view tokens; these tokens control the 3D viewpoint - the rendering pose in a scene - of generated images. Specifically, we train a small neural mapper to take continuous camera viewpoint parameters and predict a view token (a word embedding). This token conditions diffusion generation via cross-attention to produce images with the desired camera viewpoint. Using ViewNeTI as an evaluation tool, we report two findings: first, the text latent space has a continuous view-control manifold for particular 3D scenes; second, we find evidence for a generalized view-control manifold for all scenes. We conclude that since the view token controls the 3D `rendering' viewpoint, there is likely a scene representation embedded in frozen 2D diffusion models. Finally, we exploit the 3D scene representations for 3D vision tasks, namely, view-controlled text-to-image generation, and novel view synthesis from a single image, where our approach sets state-of-the-art for LPIPS.

<p>Abstract: Perspective-$n$-Point (P$n$P) stands as a fundamental algorithm for pose estimation in various applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to the P$n$P problem with relaxed constraints, eliminating the need for precise 3D coordinates, which is especially suitable for object pose estimation where corresponding object models may not be available in practice. Built upon the classical EP$n$P solver, we refer to it as AEP$n$P due to its ability to handle unknown anisotropic scaling factors in addition to the common 6D transformation. Through a few algebraic manipulations and a well-chosen frame of reference, this new problem can be boiled down to a simple linear null-space problem followed by point registration-based identification of a similarity transformation. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AEP$n$P as a flexible and practical solution to object pose estimation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Lu, Hao Kang, Haoxiang Li, Bo Liu, Yiding Yang, Qixing Huang, Gang Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Dexterous grasping aims to produce diverse grasping postures with a high grasping success rate. Regression-based methods that directly predict grasping parameters given the object may achieve a high success rate but often lack diversity. Generation-based methods that generate grasping postures conditioned on the object can often produce diverse grasping, but they are insufficient for high grasping success due to lack of discriminative information. To mitigate, we introduce a unified diffusion-based dexterous grasp generation model, dubbed the name UGG, which operates within the object point cloud and hand parameter spaces. Our all-transformer architecture unifies the information from the object, the hand, and the contacts, introducing a novel representation of contact points for improved contact modeling. The flexibility and quality of our model enable the integration of a lightweight discriminator, benefiting from simulated discriminative data, which pushes for a high success rate while preserving high diversity. Beyond grasp generation, our model can also generate objects based on hand information, offering valuable insights into object design and studying how the generative model perceives objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art dexterous grasping on the large-scale DexGraspNet dataset while facilitating human-centric object design, marking a significant advancement in dexterous grasping research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Sun, Yao Huang, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: As physical adversarial attacks become extensively applied in unearthing the potential risk of security-critical scenarios, especially in dynamic scenarios, their vulnerability to environmental variations has also been brought to light. The non-robust nature of physical adversarial attack methods brings less-than-stable performance consequently. Although methods such as EOT have enhanced the robustness of traditional contact attacks like adversarial patches, they fall short in practicality and concealment within dynamic environments such as traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, non-contact laser attacks, while offering enhanced adaptability, face constraints due to a limited optimization space for their attributes, rendering EOT less effective. This limitation underscores the necessity for developing a new strategy to augment the robustness of such practices. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Embodied Laser Attack (ELA), a novel framework that leverages the embodied intelligence paradigm of Perception-Decision-Control to dynamically tailor non-contact laser attacks. For the perception module, given the challenge of simulating the victim's view by full-image transformation, ELA has innovatively developed a local perspective transformation network, based on the intrinsic prior knowledge of traffic scenes and enables effective and efficient estimation. For the decision and control module, ELA trains an attack agent with data-driven reinforcement learning instead of adopting time-consuming heuristic algorithms, making it capable of instantaneously determining a valid attack strategy with the perceived information by well-designed rewards, which is then conducted by a controllable laser emitter. Experimentally, we apply our framework to diverse traffic scenarios both in the digital and physical world, verifying the effectiveness of our method under dynamic successive scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diogo Luvizon, Vladislav Golyanik, Adam Kortylewski, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating a controllable and relightable digital avatar from multi-view video with fixed illumination is a very challenging problem since humans are highly articulated, creating pose-dependent appearance effects, and skin as well as clothing require space-varying BRDF modeling. Existing works on creating animatible avatars either do not focus on relighting at all, require controlled illumination setups, or try to recover a relightable avatar from very low cost setups, i.e. a single RGB video, at the cost of severely limited result quality, e.g. shadows not even being modeled. To address this, we propose Relightable Neural Actor, a new video-based method for learning a pose-driven neural human model that can be relighted, allows appearance editing, and models pose-dependent effects such as wrinkles and self-shadows. Importantly, for training, our method solely requires a multi-view recording of the human under a known, but static lighting condition. To tackle this challenging problem, we leverage an implicit geometry representation of the actor with a drivable density field that models pose-dependent deformations and derive a dynamic mapping between 3D and UV spaces, where normal, visibility, and materials are effectively encoded. To evaluate our approach in real-world scenarios, we collect a new dataset with four identities recorded under different light conditions, indoors and outdoors, providing the first benchmark of its kind for human relighting, and demonstrating state-of-the-art relighting results for novel human poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibum Kim, Kanghoon Yoon, Yeonjun In, Jinyoung Moon, Donghyun Kim, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) models have suffered from inherent problems regarding the benchmark datasets such as the long-tailed predicate distribution and missing annotation problems. In this work, we aim to alleviate the long-tailed problem of SGG by utilizing unannotated triplets. To this end, we introduce a Self-Training framework for SGG (ST-SGG) that assigns pseudo-labels for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for SGG, called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM), which is a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models. Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models, particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the novel concept of visually Connecting Actions and Their Effects (CATE) in video understanding. CATE can have applications in areas like task planning and learning from demonstration. We identify and explore two different aspects of the concept of CATE: Action Selection (AS) and Effect-Affinity Assessment (EAA), where video understanding models connect actions and effects at semantic and fine-grained levels, respectively. We design various baseline models for AS and EAA. Despite the intuitive nature of the task, we observe that models struggle, and humans outperform them by a large margin. Our experiments show that in solving AS and EAA, models learn intuitive properties like object tracking and pose encoding without explicit supervision. We demonstrate that CATE can be an effective self-supervised task for learning video representations from unlabeled videos. The study aims to showcase the fundamental nature and versatility of CATE, with the hope of inspiring advanced formulations and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Chen, Yiyang Du, Zheng Fang, Ziyue Wang, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown rapid progress, moving towards the goal of creating versatile MLLMs that understand inputs from various modalities. However, existing methods typically rely on joint training with paired multimodal instruction data, which is resource-intensive and challenging to extend to new modalities. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm through the model composition of existing MLLMs to create a new model that retains the modal understanding capabilities of each original model. Our basic implementation, NaiveMC, demonstrates the effectiveness of this paradigm by reusing modality encoders and merging LLM parameters. Furthermore, we introduce DAMC to address parameter interference and mismatch issues during the merging process, thereby enhancing the model performance. To facilitate research in this area, we propose MCUB, a benchmark for assessing ability of MLLMs to understand inputs from diverse modalities. Experiments on this benchmark and four other multimodal understanding tasks show significant improvements over baselines, proving that model composition can create a versatile model capable of processing inputs from multiple modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anja Deli\'c, Matej Grci\'c, Sini\v{s}a \v{S}egvi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Outlier detection is an essential capability in safety-critical applications of supervised visual recognition. Most of the existing methods deliver best results by encouraging standard closed-set models to produce low-confidence predictions in negative training data. However, that approach conflates prediction uncertainty with recognition of the negative class. We therefore reconsider direct prediction of K+1 logits that correspond to K groundtruth classes and one outlier class. This setup allows us to formulate a novel anomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posterior of the outlier class which we term negative objectness. Now outliers can be independently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similarity with negative data. We embed our method into a dense prediction architecture with mask-level recognition over K+2 classes. The training procedure encourages the novel K+2-th class to learn negative objectness at pasted negative instances. Our models outperform the current state-of-the art on standard benchmarks for image-wide and pixel-level outlier detection with and without training on real negative data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Bastico, Etienne Decenci\`ere, Laurent Cort\'e, Yannick Tillier, David Ryckelynck</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud matching, a crucial technique in computer vision, medical and robotics fields, is primarily concerned with finding correspondences between pairs of point clouds or voxels. In some practical scenarios, emphasizing local differences is crucial for accurately identifying a correct match, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the matching process. Commonly used shape descriptors have several limitations and often fail to provide meaningful local insights about the paired geometries. In this work, we propose a new technique, based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps, to match point clouds by taking into account fine local structures. To deal with the order and sign ambiguity of Laplacian eigenmaps, we introduce a new operator, called Coupled Laplacian (https://github.com/matteo-bastico/CoupLap), that allows to easily generate aligned eigenspaces for multiple registered geometries. We show that the similarity between those aligned high-dimensional spaces provides a locally meaningful score to match shapes. We firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in a point-wise manner, focusing on the task of object anomaly localization on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset. Additionally, we define a new medical task, called automatic Bone Side Estimation (BSE), which we address through a global similarity score derived from coupled eigenspaces. In order to test it, we propose a benchmark collecting bone surface structures from various public datasets. Our matching technique, based on Coupled Laplacian, outperforms other methods by reaching an impressive accuracy on both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason J. Yu, Tristan Aumentado-Armstrong, Fereshteh Forghani, Konstantinos G. Derpanis, Marcus A. Brubaker</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of generative novel view synthesis (GNVS), generating novel, plausible views of a scene given a limited number of known views. Here, we propose a set-based generative model that can simultaneously generate multiple, self-consistent new views, conditioned on any number of views. Our approach is not limited to generating a single image at a time and can condition on a variable number of views. As a result, when generating a large number of views, our method is not restricted to a low-order autoregressive generation approach and is better able to maintain generated image quality over large sets of images. We evaluate our model on standard NVS datasets and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art image-based GNVS baselines. Further, we show that the model is capable of generating sets of views that have no natural sequential ordering, like loops and binocular trajectories, and significantly outperforms other methods on such tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AutoVER, an Autoregressive model for Visual Entity Recognition. Our model extends an autoregressive Multi-modal Large Language Model by employing retrieval augmented constrained generation. It mitigates low performance on out-of-domain entities while excelling in queries that require visually-situated reasoning. Our method learns to distinguish similar entities within a vast label space by contrastively training on hard negative pairs in parallel with a sequence-to-sequence objective without an external retriever. During inference, a list of retrieved candidate answers explicitly guides language generation by removing invalid decoding paths. The proposed method achieves significant improvements across different dataset splits in the recently proposed Oven-Wiki benchmark. Accuracy on the Entity seen split rises from 32.7% to 61.5%. It also demonstrates superior performance on the unseen and query splits by a substantial double-digit margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Li, Qin Li, Hao Wang, Xue Ma, Jiali Yao, Shaohua Dong, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to predict trajectories of targets (i.e.,"where") in videos. Yet, knowing merely "where" is insufficient in many crucial applications. In comparison, semantic understanding such as fine-grained behaviors, interactions, and overall summarized captions (i.e., "what") from videos, associated with "where", is highly-desired for comprehensive video analysis. Thus motivated, we introduce Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT), that aims to estimate object trajectories and meanwhile understand semantic details of associated trajectories including instance captions, instance interactions, and overall video captions, integrating "where" and "what" for tracking. In order to foster the exploration of SMOT, we propose BenSMOT, a large-scale Benchmark for Semantic MOT. Specifically, BenSMOT comprises 3,292 videos with 151K frames, covering various scenarios for semantic tracking of humans. BenSMOT provides annotations for the trajectories of targets, along with associated instance captions in natural language, instance interactions, and overall caption for each video sequence. To our best knowledge, BenSMOT is the first publicly available benchmark for SMOT. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a novel tracker named SMOTer, which is specially designed and end-to-end trained for SMOT, showing promising performance. By releasing BenSMOT, we expect to go beyond conventional MOT by predicting "where" and "what" for SMOT, opening up a new direction in tracking for video understanding. Our BenSMOT and SMOTer will be released.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05231">Tracking Meets LoRA: Faster Training, Larger Model, Stronger Performance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liting Lin, Heng Fan, Zhipeng Zhang, Yaowei Wang, Yong Xu, Haibin Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in large language models, we propose LoRAT, a method that unveils the power of large ViT model for tracking within laboratory-level resources. The essence of our work lies in adapting LoRA, a technique that fine-tunes a small subset of model parameters without adding inference latency, to the domain of visual tracking. However, unique challenges and potential domain gaps make this transfer not as easy as the first intuition. Firstly, a transformer-based tracker constructs unshared position embedding for template and search image. This poses a challenge for the transfer of LoRA, usually requiring consistency in the design when applied to the pre-trained backbone, to downstream tasks. Secondly, the inductive bias inherent in convolutional heads diminishes the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in tracking models. To overcome these limitations, we first decouple the position embeddings in transformer-based trackers into shared spatial ones and independent type ones. The shared embeddings, which describe the absolute coordinates of multi-resolution images (namely, the template and search images), are inherited from the pre-trained backbones. In contrast, the independent embeddings indicate the sources of each token and are learned from scratch. Furthermore, we design an anchor-free head solely based on MLP to adapt PETR, enabling better performance with less computational overhead. With our design, 1) it becomes practical to train trackers with the ViT-g backbone on GPUs with only memory of 25.8GB (batch size of 16); 2) we reduce the training time of the L-224 variant from 35.0 to 10.8 GPU hours; 3) we improve the LaSOT SUC score from 0.703 to 0.742 with the L-224 variant; 4) we fast the inference speed of the L-224 variant from 52 to 119 FPS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas B\"ar, Neil Houlsby, Mostafa Dehghani, Manoj Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a linear classifier or lightweight model on top of pretrained vision model outputs, so-called 'frozen features', leads to impressive performance on a number of downstream few-shot tasks. Currently, frozen features are not modified during training. On the other hand, when networks are trained directly on images, data augmentation is a standard recipe that improves performance with no substantial overhead. In this paper, we conduct an extensive pilot study on few-shot image classification that explores applying data augmentations in the frozen feature space, dubbed 'frozen feature augmentation (FroFA)', covering twenty augmentations in total. Our study demonstrates that adopting a deceptively simple pointwise FroFA, such as brightness, can improve few-shot performance consistently across three network architectures, three large pretraining datasets, and eight transfer datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> El Hadji S. Diop, Thierno Fall, Alioune Mbengue, Mohamed Daoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Xie, Hongyi Xu, Guoxian Song, Chao Wang, Yichun Shi, Linjie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose X-Portrait, an innovative conditional diffusion model tailored for generating expressive and temporally coherent portrait animation. Specifically, given a single portrait as appearance reference, we aim to animate it with motion derived from a driving video, capturing both highly dynamic and subtle facial expressions along with wide-range head movements. As its core, we leverage the generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model as the rendering backbone, while achieve fine-grained head pose and expression control with novel controlling signals within the framework of ControlNet. In contrast to conventional coarse explicit controls such as facial landmarks, our motion control module is learned to interpret the dynamics directly from the original driving RGB inputs. The motion accuracy is further enhanced with a patch-based local control module that effectively enhance the motion attention to small-scale nuances like eyeball positions. Notably, to mitigate the identity leakage from the driving signals, we train our motion control modules with scaling-augmented cross-identity images, ensuring maximized disentanglement from the appearance reference modules. Experimental results demonstrate the universal effectiveness of X-Portrait across a diverse range of facial portraits and expressive driving sequences, and showcase its proficiency in generating captivating portrait animations with consistently maintained identity characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongmin Bae, Seoha Kim, Youngsik Yun, Hahyun Lee, Gun Bang, Youngjung Uh</p>
<p>Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides fast and high-quality novel view synthesis, it is a natural extension to deform a canonical 3DGS to multiple frames for representing a dynamic scene. However, previous works fail to accurately reconstruct complex dynamic scenes. We attribute the failure to the design of the deformation field, which is built as a coordinate-based function. This approach is problematic because 3DGS is a mixture of multiple fields centered at the Gaussians, not just a single coordinate-based framework. To resolve this problem, we define the deformation as a function of per-Gaussian embeddings and temporal embeddings. Moreover, we decompose deformations as coarse and fine deformations to model slow and fast movements, respectively. Also, we introduce a local smoothness regularization for per-Gaussian embedding to improve the details in dynamic regions. Project page: https://jeongminb.github.io/e-d3dgs/</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13671">FiLo: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection by Fine-Grained Description and High-Quality Localization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Gu, Bingke Zhu, Guibo Zhu, Yingying Chen, Hao Li, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods entail detecting anomalies directly without access to any known normal or abnormal samples within the target item categories. Existing approaches typically rely on the robust generalization capabilities of multimodal pretrained models, computing similarities between manually crafted textual features representing "normal" or "abnormal" semantics and image features to detect anomalies and localize anomalous patches. However, the generic descriptions of "abnormal" often fail to precisely match diverse types of anomalies across different object categories. Additionally, computing feature similarities for single patches struggles to pinpoint specific locations of anomalies with various sizes and scales. To address these issues, we propose a novel ZSAD method called FiLo, comprising two components: adaptively learned Fine-Grained Description (FG-Des) and position-enhanced High-Quality Localization (HQ-Loc). FG-Des introduces fine-grained anomaly descriptions for each category using Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs adaptively learned textual templates to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection. HQ-Loc, utilizing Grounding DINO for preliminary localization, position-enhanced text prompts, and Multi-scale Multi-shape Cross-modal Interaction (MMCI) module, facilitates more accurate localization of anomalies of different sizes and shapes. Experimental results on datasets like MVTec and VisA demonstrate that FiLo significantly improves the performance of ZSAD in both detection and localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an image-level AUC of 83.9% and a pixel-level AUC of 95.9% on the VisA dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Brachmann, Jamie Wynn, Shuai Chen, Tommaso Cavallari, \'Aron Monszpart, Daniyar Turmukhambetov, Victor Adrian Prisacariu</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the task of estimating camera parameters from a set of images depicting a scene. Popular feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) tools solve this task by incremental reconstruction: they repeat triangulation of sparse 3D points and registration of more camera views to the sparse point cloud. We re-interpret incremental structure-from-motion as an iterated application and refinement of a visual relocalizer, that is, of a method that registers new views to the current state of the reconstruction. This perspective allows us to investigate alternative visual relocalizers that are not rooted in local feature matching. We show that scene coordinate regression, a learning-based relocalization approach, allows us to build implicit, neural scene representations from unposed images. Different from other learning-based reconstruction methods, we do not require pose priors nor sequential inputs, and we optimize efficiently over thousands of images. In many cases, our method, ACE0, estimates camera poses with an accuracy close to feature-based SfM, as demonstrated by novel view synthesis. Project page: https://nianticlabs.github.io/acezero/</p>

Instead, a classifier can identify the selected organ without segmenting the entire volume. In this study, we demonstrate a classifier based method to obtain organ labels in real time by using a large context size with a sparse data sampling strategy. Although our method operates as an independent classifier at query locations, it can generate full segmentations by querying grid locations at any resolution, offering faster performance than segmentation algorithms. We compared our method with existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating its superior runtime potential for practical applications in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoqin Ye, Junjie Zhang, Hongwei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of medical image recognition is notably complicated by the presence of varied and multiple pathological indications, presenting a unique challenge in multi-label classification with unseen labels. This complexity underlines the need for computer-aided diagnosis methods employing multi-label zero-shot learning. Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have showcased notable zero-shot classification abilities on medical images. However, these methods have limitations on leveraging extensive pre-trained knowledge from broader image datasets, and often depend on manual prompt construction by expert radiologists. By automating the process of prompt tuning, prompt learning techniques have emerged as an efficient way to adapt VLMs to downstream tasks. Yet, existing CoOp-based strategies fall short in performing class-specific prompts on unseen categories, limiting generalizability in fine-grained scenarios. To overcome these constraints, we introduce a novel prompt generation approach inspirited by text generation in natural language processing (NLP). Our method, named Pseudo-Prompt Generating (PsPG), capitalizes on the priori knowledge of multi-modal features. Featuring a RNN-based decoder, PsPG autoregressively generates class-tailored embedding vectors, i.e., pseudo-prompts. Comparative evaluations on various multi-label chest radiograph datasets affirm the superiority of our approach against leading medical vision-language and multi-label prompt learning methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we delve into a new task known as small object editing (SOE), which focuses on text-based image inpainting within a constrained, small-sized area. Despite the remarkable success have been achieved by current image inpainting approaches, their application to the SOE task generally results in failure cases such as Object Missing, Text-Image Mismatch, and Distortion. These failures stem from the limited use of small-sized objects in training datasets and the downsampling operations employed by U-Net models, which hinders accurate generation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training-based approach, SOEDiff, aimed at enhancing the capability of baseline models like StableDiffusion in editing small-sized objects while minimizing training costs. Specifically, our method involves two key components: SO-LoRA, which efficiently fine-tunes low-rank matrices, and Cross-Scale Score Distillation loss, which leverages high-resolution predictions from the pre-trained teacher diffusion model. Our method presents significant improvements on the test dataset collected from MSCOCO and OpenImage, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method in small object editing. In particular, when comparing SOEDiff with SD-I model on the OpenImage-f dataset, we observe a 0.99 improvement in CLIP-Score and a reduction of 2.87 in FID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisu Liu, Jinyang An, Wanqian Zhang, Dayan Wu, Jingzi Gu, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of diffusion-based customization methods like DreamBooth, individuals now have access to train the models that can generate their personalized images. Despite the convenience, malicious users have misused these techniques to create fake images, thereby triggering a privacy security crisis. In light of this, proactive adversarial attacks are proposed to protect users against customization. The adversarial examples are trained to distort the customization model's outputs and thus block the misuse. In this paper, we propose DisDiff (Disrupting Diffusion), a novel adversarial attack method to disrupt the diffusion model outputs. We first delve into the intrinsic image-text relationships, well-known as cross-attention, and empirically find that the subject-identifier token plays an important role in guiding image generation. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Erasure module to explicitly "erase" the indicated attention maps and disrupt the text guidance. Besides,we analyze the influence of the sampling process of the diffusion model on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack and introduce a novel Merit Sampling Scheduler to adaptively modulate the perturbation updating amplitude in a step-aware manner. Our DisDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12.75% of FDFR scores and 7.25% of ISM scores across two facial benchmarks and two commonly used prompts on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual engines can generate dense depth maps for various synthetic scenes, making them invaluable for training depth estimation models. However, discrepancies between synthetic and real-world colors pose significant challenges for depth estimation in real-world scenes, especially in complex and uncertain environments encountered in unsupervised monocular depth estimation tasks. To address this issue, we propose Back2Color, a framework that predicts realistic colors from depth using a model trained on real-world data, thus transforming synthetic colors into their real-world counterparts. Additionally, we introduce the Syn-Real CutMix method for joint training with both real-world unsupervised and synthetic supervised depth samples, enhancing monocular depth estimation performance in real-world scenes. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of non-rigid motions on depth estimation, we present an auto-learning uncertainty temporal-spatial fusion method (Auto-UTSF), which leverages the strengths of unsupervised learning in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We also designed VADepth, based on the Vision Attention Network, which offers lower computational complexity and higher accuracy than transformers. Our Back2Color framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Kitti dataset, as evidenced by improvements in performance metrics and the production of fine-grained details. This is particularly evident on more challenging datasets such as Cityscapes for unsupervised depth estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the perception ability of the Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 8 advanced open-source LVLMs with 10 checkpoints are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released in \url{https://github.com/Benchmark-Dysca/Dysca}.</p>

Our benchmark comprises a diverse set of 400 image-prompt pairs, each crafted to challenge the models' compliance with layered instructions in generating accurate responses that satisfy specific requested patterns. Evaluation results from a wide array of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant variations in performance, highlighting areas for improvement in instruction fidelity. Additionally, we create extra training data and explore supervised fine-tuning to enhance the models' ability to strictly follow instructions without compromising performance on other tasks. We hope this benchmark not only serves as a tool for measuring MLLM adherence to instructions, but also guides future developments in MLLM training methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuohao Shi, Qiang Fang, Tong Zhao, Xin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tiny object detection is becoming one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision because of the limited object size and lack of information. The label assignment strategy is a key factor affecting the accuracy of object detection. Although there are some effective label assignment strategies for tiny objects, most of them focus on reducing the sensitivity to the bounding boxes to increase the number of positive samples and have some fixed hyperparameters need to set. However, more positive samples may not necessarily lead to better detection results, in fact, excessive positive samples may lead to more false positives. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective strategy named the Similarity Distance (SimD) to evaluate the similarity between bounding boxes. This proposed strategy not only considers both location and shape similarity but also learns hyperparameters adaptively, ensuring that it can adapt to different datasets and various object sizes in a dataset. Our approach can be simply applied in common anchor-based detectors in place of the IoU for label assignment and Non Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experiments on four mainstream tiny object detection datasets demonstrate superior performance of our method, especially, 1.8 AP points and 4.1 AP points of very tiny higher than the state-of-the-art competitors on AI-TOD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Lee, Changyeon Lee, Kevin Farhat, Lin Qiu, Steve Geluso, Aerin Kim, Oren Etzioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal generative models are rapidly evolving, leading to a surge in the generation of realistic video and audio that offers exciting possibilities but also serious risks. Deepfake videos, which can convincingly impersonate individuals, have particularly garnered attention due to their potential misuse in spreading misinformation and creating fraudulent content. This survey paper examines the dual landscape of deepfake video generation and detection, emphasizing the need for effective countermeasures against potential abuses. We provide a comprehensive overview of current deepfake generation techniques, including face swapping, reenactment, and audio-driven animation, which leverage cutting-edge technologies like GANs and diffusion models to produce highly realistic fake videos. Additionally, we analyze various detection approaches designed to differentiate authentic from altered videos, from detecting visual artifacts to deploying advanced algorithms that pinpoint inconsistencies across video and audio signals.
  The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation. We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial. We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Yan, Ping Zhang, Haofei Zhang, Ruqian Hao, Juanxiu Liu, Xiaoyang Wang, Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) tracking is pivotal in computer vision tasks due to its all-weather imaging capability. Traditional tracking methods predominantly rely on hand-crafted features, and while deep learning has introduced correlation filtering techniques, these are often constrained by rudimentary correlation operations. Furthermore, transformer-based approaches tend to overlook temporal and coordinate information, which is critical for TIR tracking that lacks texture and color information. In this paper, to address these issues, we apply natural language modeling to TIR tracking and propose a coordinate-aware thermal infrared tracking model called NLMTrack, which enhances the utilization of coordinate and temporal information. NLMTrack applies an encoder that unifies feature extraction and feature fusion, which simplifies the TIR tracking pipeline. To address the challenge of low detail and low contrast in TIR images, on the one hand, we design a multi-level progressive fusion module that enhances the semantic representation and incorporates multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder combines the TIR features and the coordinate sequence features using a causal transformer to generate the target sequence step by step. Moreover, we explore an adaptive loss aimed at elevating tracking accuracy and a simple template update strategy to accommodate the target's appearance variations. Experiments show that NLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ELOESZHANG/NLMTrack}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Xin, Andreas Hartel, Enkelejda Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate real-time object detection is vital across numerous industrial applications, from safety monitoring to quality control. Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data as ground truth. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Korycki, Colleen Josephson, Steve McGuire</p>
<p>Abstract: As Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) implementations become faster, more efficient and accurate, their applicability to real world mapping tasks becomes more accessible. Traditionally, 3D mapping, or scene reconstruction, has relied on expensive LiDAR sensing. Photogrammetry can perform image-based 3D reconstruction but is computationally expensive and requires extremely dense image representation to recover complex geometry and photorealism. NeRFs perform 3D scene reconstruction by training a neural network on sparse image and pose data, achieving superior results to photogrammetry with less input data. This paper presents an evaluation of two NeRF scene reconstructions for the purpose of estimating the diameter of a vertical PVC cylinder. One of these are trained on commodity iPhone data and the other is trained on robot-sourced imagery and poses. This neural-geometry is compared to state-of-the-art lidar-inertial SLAM in terms of scene noise and metric-accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER) is vital for effective interpersonal interactions. Human emotional expressions are inherently complex due to the presence of compound expressions, requiring the consideration of both local and global facial cues for accurate judgment. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning-based solution to address this complexity. Our approach involves training three distinct expression classification models using convolutional networks, Vision Transformers, and multiscale local attention networks. By employing late fusion for model ensemble, we combine the outputs of these models to predict the final results. Our method demonstrates high accuracy on the RAF-DB datasets and is capable of recognizing expressions in certain portions of the C-EXPR-DB through zero-shot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Wu, Ce Zheng, Zihao Yang, Chen Chen, Srijan Das, Aidong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, transformers have demonstrated great potential for modeling long-term dependencies from skeleton sequences and thereby gained ever-increasing attention in skeleton action recognition. However, the existing transformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism for capturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learning discriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actions with subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-aware attention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embedding joint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish the discriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently, we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial features with frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns. Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the global correlations across frames. Extensive experiments show that FreqMiXFormer outperforms SOTA on 3 popular skeleton action recognition datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.</p>

We conduct the Pretrain-Finetune strategy to effectively utilize large scale public datasets and streamline development processes. Moreover, we present a Multi-Module Learning (MML) approach, enhancing performance through synergistic and iterative training of multiple models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariya Hendriksen, Shuo Zhang, Ridho Reinanda, Mohamed Yahya, Edgar Meij, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-text retrieval (ITR), an important task in information retrieval (IR), is driven by pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) that consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, a significant challenge lies in the brittleness of existing ITR benchmarks. In standard datasets for the task, captions often provide broad summaries of scenes, neglecting detailed information about specific concepts. Additionally, the current evaluation setup assumes simplistic binary matches between images and texts and focuses on intra-modality rather than cross-modal relationships, which can lead to misinterpretations of model performance. Motivated by this gap, in this study, we focus on examining the brittleness of the ITR evaluation pipeline with a focus on concept granularity. We start by analyzing two common benchmarks, MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compare them with their augmented versions, MS-COCO-FG and Flickr30k-FG, given a specified set of linguistic features capturing concept granularity. We discover that Flickr30k-FG and MS COCO-FG consistently achieve higher scores across all the selected features. To investigate the performance of VLMs on coarse and fine-grained datasets, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations. We apply these perturbations to the selected datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art models - ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT - on the standard and fine-grained datasets under zero-shot conditions, with and without the applied perturbations. The results demonstrate that although perturbations generally degrade model performance, the fine-grained datasets exhibit a smaller performance drop than their standard counterparts. Moreover, the relative performance drop across all setups is consistent across all models and datasets, indicating that the issue lies within the benchmarks. We conclude the paper by providing an agenda for improving ITR evaluation pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth D Jaiswal, Animesh Ganai, Abhisek Dash, Saptarshi Ghosh, Animesh Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates. Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints. This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems. A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem. In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse. To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images. We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming). Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%). Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%). Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs. Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings. In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Chen, Amir Atapour-Abarghouei, Haozheng Zhang, Hubert P. H. Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting, or image completion, is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to restore missing or damaged regions of images with semantically coherent content. This technique requires a precise balance of local texture replication and global contextual understanding to ensure the restored image integrates seamlessly with its surroundings. Traditional methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective at capturing local patterns but often struggle with broader contextual relationships due to the limited receptive fields. Recent advancements have incorporated transformers, leveraging their ability to understand global interactions. However, these methods face computational inefficiencies and struggle to maintain fine-grained details. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MxT composed of the proposed Hybrid Module (HM), which combines Mamba with the transformer in a synergistic manner. Mamba is adept at efficiently processing long sequences with linear computational costs, making it an ideal complement to the transformer for handling long-scale data interactions. Our HM facilitates dual-level interaction learning at both pixel and patch levels, greatly enhancing the model to reconstruct images with high quality and contextual accuracy. We evaluate MxT on the widely-used CelebA-HQ and Places2-standard datasets, where it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: As autonomous driving systems increasingly become part of daily transportation, the ability to accurately anticipate and mitigate potential traffic accidents is paramount. Traditional accident anticipation models primarily utilizing dashcam videos are adept at predicting when an accident may occur but fall short in localizing the incident and identifying involved entities. Addressing this gap, this study introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance predictive capabilities across multiple dimensions--what, when, and where accidents might occur. We develop an innovative chain-based attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts to prioritize high-risk elements within complex driving scenes. This mechanism is complemented by a three-stage model that processes outputs from smaller models into detailed multimodal inputs for LLMs, thus enabling a more nuanced understanding of traffic dynamics. Empirical validation on the DAD, CCD, and A3D datasets demonstrates superior performance in Average Precision (AP) and Mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA), establishing new benchmarks for accident prediction technology. Our approach not only advances the technological framework for autonomous driving safety but also enhances human-AI interaction, making predictive insights generated by autonomous systems more intuitive and actionable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Wilson, Nicholas Autio Mitchell, Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes, James Hays</p>
<p>Abstract: Lidar-based perception pipelines rely on 3D object detection models to interpret complex scenes. While multiple representations for lidar exist, the range-view is enticing since it losslessly encodes the entire lidar sensor output. In this work, we achieve state-of-the-art amongst range-view 3D object detection models without using multiple techniques proposed in past range-view literature. We explore range-view 3D object detection across two modern datasets with substantially different properties: Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open. Our investigation reveals key insights: (1) input feature dimensionality significantly influences the overall performance, (2) surprisingly, employing a classification loss grounded in 3D spatial proximity works as well or better compared to more elaborate IoU-based losses, and (3) addressing non-uniform lidar density via a straightforward range subsampling technique outperforms existing multi-resolution, range-conditioned networks. Our experiments reveal that techniques proposed in recent range-view literature are not needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Combining the above findings, we establish a new state-of-the-art model for range-view 3D object detection -- improving AP by 2.2% on the Waymo Open dataset while maintaining a runtime of 10 Hz. We establish the first range-view model on the Argoverse 2 dataset and outperform strong voxel-based baselines. All models are multi-class and open-source.

In this paper, we present our methods and experimental results for the two competition tracks. Specifically, it can be summarized in the following four aspects: 1) To attain high-quality facial features, we train a Masked-Auto Encoder in a self-supervised manner. 2) We devise a temporal convergence module to capture the temporal information between video frames and explore the impact of window size and sequence length on each sub-task. 3) To facilitate the joint optimization of various sub-tasks, we explore the impact of sub-task joint training and feature fusion from individual tasks on each task performance improvement. 4) We utilize curriculum learning to transition the model from recognizing single expressions to recognizing compound expressions, thereby improving the accuracy of compound expression recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Zhu, Beier Zhu, Yi Tan, Shuo Wang, Yanbin Hao, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP are capable of mapping the different modality data into a unified feature space, enabling zero/few-shot inference by measuring the similarity of given images and texts. However, most existing methods overlook modality gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other, resulting in limited classification performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a method called Selective Vision-Language Subspace Projection (SSP), which incorporates local image features and utilizes them as a bridge to enhance the alignment between image-text pairs. Specifically, our SSP framework comprises two parallel modules: a vision projector and a language projector. Both projectors utilize local image features to span the respective subspaces for image and texts, thereby projecting the image and text features into their respective subspaces to achieve alignment. Moreover, our approach entails only training-free matrix calculations and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced CLIP-based few-shot learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets have demonstrated SSP's superior text-image alignment capabilities, outperforming the state-of-the-art alignment methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Lei, Huilin Zhu, Jingling Yuan, Guangli Xiang, Xian Zhong, Shengfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Drone-based crowd tracking faces difficulties in accurately identifying and monitoring objects from an aerial perspective, largely due to their small size and close proximity to each other, which complicates both localization and tracking. To address these challenges, we present the Density-aware Tracking (DenseTrack) framework. DenseTrack capitalizes on crowd counting to precisely determine object locations, blending visual and motion cues to improve the tracking of small-scale objects. It specifically addresses the problem of cross-frame motion to enhance tracking accuracy and dependability. DenseTrack employs crowd density estimates as anchors for exact object localization within video frames. These estimates are merged with motion and position information from the tracking network, with motion offsets serving as key tracking cues. Moreover, DenseTrack enhances the ability to distinguish small-scale objects using insights from the visual-language model, integrating appearance with motion cues. The framework utilizes the Hungarian algorithm to ensure the accurate matching of individuals across frames. Demonstrated on DroneCrowd dataset, our approach exhibits superior performance, confirming its effectiveness in scenarios captured by drones.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper does not describe a novel method. Instead, it studies an essential foundation for reliable benchmarking and ultimately real-world application of AI-based image analysis: generating high-quality reference annotations. Previous research has focused on crowdsourcing as a means of outsourcing annotations. However, little attention has so far been given to annotation companies, specifically regarding their internal quality assurance (QA) processes. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the influence of QA employed by annotation companies on annotation quality and devise methodologies for maximizing data annotation efficacy. Based on a total of 57,648 instance segmented images obtained from a total of 924 annotators and 34 QA workers from four annotation companies and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we derived the following insights: (1) Annotation companies perform better both in terms of quantity and quality compared to the widely used platform MTurk. (2) Annotation companies' internal QA only provides marginal improvements, if any. However, improving labeling instructions instead of investing in QA can substantially boost annotation performance. (3) The benefit of internal QA depends on specific image characteristics. Our work could enable researchers to derive substantially more value from a fixed annotation budget and change the way annotation companies conduct internal QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Su, Shihao Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Distillation-based self-supervised learning typically leads to more compressed representations due to its radical clustering process and the implementation of a sharper target distribution. To overcome this limitation and preserve more information from input, we introduce UDI, conceptualized as Unsqueezed Distillation-based self-supervised learning (SSL). UDI enriches the learned representation by encouraging multimodal prediction distilled from a consolidated profile of local predictions that are derived via stratified sampling. Our evaluations show that UDI not only promotes semantically meaningful representations at instance level, delivering superior or competitive results to state-of-the-art SSL methods in image classification, but also effectively preserves the nuisance of input, which yields significant improvement in dense prediction tasks, including object detection and segmentation. Additionally, UDI performs competitively in low-shot image classification, improving the scalability of joint-embedding pipelines. Various visualizations and ablation studies are presented to further elucidate the mechanisms behind UDI. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ISL-CV/udi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuming Liu, Lin Sui, Chen-Lin Zhang, Fangzhou Mu, Chen Zhao, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: As a fundamental task in long-form video understanding, temporal action detection (TAD) aims to capture inherent temporal relations in untrimmed videos and identify candidate actions with precise boundaries. Over the years, various networks, including convolutions, graphs, and transformers, have been explored for effective temporal modeling for TAD. However, these modules typically treat past and future information equally, overlooking the crucial fact that changes in action boundaries are essentially causal events. Inspired by this insight, we propose leveraging the temporal causality of actions to enhance TAD representation by restricting the model's access to only past or future context. We introduce CausalTAD, which combines causal attention and causal Mamba to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, with CausalTAD, we ranked 1st in the Action Recognition, Action Detection, and Audio-Based Interaction Detection tracks at the EPIC-Kitchens Challenge 2024, as well as 1st in the Moment Queries track at the Ego4D Challenge 2024.

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, computer vision applications in minimally invasive surgery have rapidly increased. Despite this growth, the impact of surgical computer vision remains limited compared to other medical fields like pathology and radiology, primarily due to the scarcity of representative annotated data. Whereas transfer learning from large annotated datasets such as ImageNet has been conventionally the norm to achieve high-performing models, recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated superior performance. In medical image analysis, in-domain SSL pretraining has already been shown to outperform ImageNet-based initialization. Although unlabeled data in the field of surgical computer vision is abundant, the diversity within this data is limited. This study investigates the role of dataset diversity in SSL for surgical computer vision, comparing procedure-specific datasets against a more heterogeneous general surgical dataset across three different downstream surgical applications. The obtained results show that using solely procedure-specific data can lead to substantial improvements of 13.8%, 9.5%, and 36.8% compared to ImageNet pretraining. However, extending this data with more heterogeneous surgical data further increases performance by an additional 5.0%, 5.2%, and 2.5%, suggesting that increasing diversity within SSL data is beneficial for model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Wang, Hao Li, Dewei Hu, Yuankai K. Tao, Ipek Oguz</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images are crucial for ophthalmology studies but are limited by their relatively narrow field of view (FoV). Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also made our evaluation tool for image mosaicking and the corresponding pipeline publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking}.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00019">Diffusion MRI with Machine Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Davood Karimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of brain's tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of brain pathologies and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements often suffer from strong noise and artifacts, there is usually high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, and considerable inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. These include deficient evaluation practices, lack of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a groundbreaking multimodal, multi-task, multi-teacher joint-grained knowledge distillation model for visually-rich form document understanding. The model is designed to leverage insights from both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels by facilitating a nuanced correlation between token and entity representations, addressing the complexities inherent in form documents. Additionally, we introduce new inter-grained and cross-grained loss functions to further refine diverse multi-teacher knowledge distillation transfer process, presenting distribution gaps and a harmonised understanding of form documents. Through a comprehensive evaluation across publicly available form document understanding datasets, our proposed model consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its efficacy in handling the intricate structures and content of visually complex form documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruchi Bhatt, Pratibha Kumari, Dwarikanath Mahapatra, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik, Mukesh Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio analysis is useful in many application scenarios. The state-of-the-art audio analysis approaches assume the data distribution at training and deployment time will be the same. However, due to various real-life challenges, the data may encounter drift in its distribution or can encounter new classes in the late future. Thus, a one-time trained model might not perform adequately. Continual learning (CL) approaches are devised to handle such changes in data distribution. There have been a few attempts to use CL approaches for audio analysis. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation framework. In this paper, we create a comprehensive CL dataset and characterize CL approaches for audio-based monitoring tasks. We have investigated the following CL and non-CL approaches: EWC, LwF, SI, GEM, A-GEM, GDumb, Replay, Naive, Cumulative, and Joint training. The study is very beneficial for researchers and practitioners working in the area of audio analysis for developing adaptive models. We observed that Replay achieved better results than other methods in the DCASE challenge data. It achieved an accuracy of 70.12% for the domain incremental scenario and an accuracy of 96.98% for the class incremental scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooyan Rahmanzadehgervi, Logan Bolton, Mohammad Reza Taesiri, Anh Totti Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, are powering various image-text applications and scoring high on many vision-understanding benchmarks, we find that they are surprisingly still struggling with low-level vision tasks that are easy to humans. Specifically, on BlindTest, our suite of 7 very simple tasks such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting circles in an Olympic-like logo, four state-of-the-art VLMs are only 58.57% accurate on average. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs the best at 74.94% accuracy, but this is still far from the human expected accuracy of 100%. Across different image resolutions and line widths, VLMs consistently struggle with tasks that require precise spatial information and recognizing geometric primitives that overlap or are close together.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651">Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Foundation Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetan Chu, Yilan Zhang, Zhongyi Han, Changchun Yang, Longxi Zhou, Gongning Luo, Xin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Lei, Xiaoman Zhang, Chaoyi Wu, Lisong Dai, Ya Zhang, Yanyong Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie, Yuehua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists are tasked with interpreting a large number of images in a daily base, with the responsibility of generating corresponding reports. This demanding workload elevates the risk of human error, potentially leading to treatment delays, increased healthcare costs, revenue loss, and operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we initiate a series of work on grounded Automatic Report Generation (AutoRG), starting from the brain MRI interpretation system, which supports the delineation of brain structures, the localization of anomalies, and the generation of well-organized findings. We make contributions from the following aspects, first, on dataset construction, we release a comprehensive dataset encompassing segmentation masks of anomaly regions and manually authored reports, termed as RadGenome-Brain MRI. This data resource is intended to catalyze ongoing research and development in the field of AI-assisted report generation systems. Second, on system design, we propose AutoRG-Brain, the first brain MRI report generation system with pixel-level grounded visual clues. Third, for evaluation, we conduct quantitative assessments and human evaluations of brain structure segmentation, anomaly localization, and report generation tasks to provide evidence of its reliability and accuracy. This system has been integrated into real clinical scenarios, where radiologists were instructed to write reports based on our generated findings and anomaly segmentation masks. The results demonstrate that our system enhances the report-writing skills of junior doctors, aligning their performance more closely with senior doctors, thereby boosting overall productivity.</p>
