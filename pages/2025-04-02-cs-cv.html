<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Weng, Aasa Feragen, Siavash Bigdeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have achieved remarkable success in image generation, but their step-by-step denoising process remains opaque, leaving critical aspects of the generation mechanism unexplained. To address this, we introduce \emph{Patronus}, an interpretable diffusion model inspired by ProtoPNet. Patronus integrates a prototypical network into DDPMs, enabling the extraction of prototypes and conditioning of the generation process on their prototype activation vector. This design enhances interpretability by showing the learned prototypes and how they influence the generation process. Additionally, the model supports downstream tasks like image manipulation, enabling more transparent and controlled modifications. Moreover, Patronus could reveal shortcut learning in the generation process by detecting unwanted correlations between learned prototypes. Notably, Patronus operates entirely without any annotations or text prompts. This work opens new avenues for understanding and controlling diffusion models through prototype-based interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanling Zhang, Rundong Su, Zhihang Yuan, Pengtao Chen, Mingzhu Shen Yibo Fan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models, especially Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT), have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images. However, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks, particularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training compression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an in-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences from prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching mechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this gap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By leveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach significantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just minutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized kernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x end-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Xu Ma, Yitian Zhang, Zhongruo Wang, Sung-Cheol Kim, Vahid Mirjalili, Vidya Renganathan, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gating mechanisms have emerged as an effective strategy integrated into model designs beyond recurrent neural networks for addressing long-range dependency problems. In a broad understanding, it provides adaptive control over the information flow while maintaining computational efficiency. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis on how the gating mechanism works in neural networks. In this paper, inspired by the {convolution theorem}, we systematically explore the effect of gating mechanisms on the training dynamics of neural networks from a frequency perspective. We investigate the interact between the element-wise product and activation functions in managing the responses to different frequency components. Leveraging these insights, we propose a Gating Mechanism Network (GmNet), a lightweight model designed to efficiently utilize the information of various frequency components. It minimizes the low-frequency bias present in existing lightweight models. GmNet achieves impressive performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in the image classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumitri Chattopadhyay, Basar Demir, Marc Niethammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shift, caused by variations in imaging modalities and acquisition protocols, limits model generalization in medical image segmentation. While foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse large-scale data hold promise for zero-shot generalization, their application to volumetric medical data remains underexplored. In this study, we examine their ability towards domain generalization (DG), by conducting a comprehensive experimental study encompassing 6 medical segmentation FMs and 12 public datasets spanning multiple modalities and anatomies. Our findings reveal the potential of promptable FMs in bridging the domain gap via smart prompting techniques. Additionally, by probing into multiple facets of zero-shot DG, we offer valuable insights into the viability of FMs for DG and identify promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Gavryushin, Florian Redhardt, Gaia Di Lorenzo, Luc Van Gool, Marc Pollefeys, Kaichun Mo, Xi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sonar sensing is fundamental for underwater robotics, but limited by capabilities of AI systems, which need large training datasets. Public data in sonar modalities is lacking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lauren Shrack, Timm Haucke, Antoine Sala\"un, Arjun Subramonian, Sara Beery</p>
<p>Abstract: The differences between images belonging to fine-grained categories are often subtle and highly localized, and existing explainability techniques for deep learning models are often too diffuse to provide useful and interpretable explanations. We propose a new explainability method (PAIR-X) that leverages both intermediate model activations and backpropagated relevance scores to generate fine-grained, highly-localized pairwise visual explanations. We use animal and building re-identification (re-ID) as a primary case study of our method, and we demonstrate qualitatively improved results over a diverse set of explainability baselines on 35 public re-ID datasets. In interviews, animal re-ID experts were in unanimous agreement that PAIR-X was an improvement over existing baselines for deep model explainability, and suggested that its visualizations would be directly applicable to their work. We also propose a novel quantitative evaluation metric for our method, and demonstrate that PAIR-X visualizations appear more plausible for correct image matches than incorrect ones even when the model similarity score for the pairs is the same. By improving interpretability, PAIR-X enables humans to better distinguish correct and incorrect matches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/pairx-explains/pairx</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Ting Shen, Sungmin Eum, Doheon Lee, Rohit Shete, Chiao-Yi Wang, Heesung Kwon, Shuvra S. Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed pose retrieval (CPR) enables users to search for human poses by specifying a reference pose and a transition description, but progress in this field is hindered by the scarcity and inconsistency of annotated pose transitions. Existing CPR datasets rely on costly human annotations or heuristic-based rule generation, both of which limit scalability and diversity. In this work, we introduce AutoComPose, the first framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to automatically generate rich and structured pose transition descriptions. Our method enhances annotation quality by structuring transitions into fine-grained body part movements and introducing mirrored/swapped variations, while a cyclic consistency constraint ensures logical coherence between forward and reverse transitions. To advance CPR research, we construct and release two dedicated benchmarks, AIST-CPR and PoseFixCPR, supplementing prior datasets with enhanced attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training retrieval models with AutoComPose yields superior performance over human-annotated and heuristic-based methods, significantly reducing annotation costs while improving retrieval quality. Our work pioneers the automatic annotation of pose transitions, establishing a scalable foundation for future CPR research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22890">MedCL: Learning Consistent Anatomy Distribution for Scribble-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Zhang, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Curating large-scale fully annotated datasets is expensive, laborious, and cumbersome, especially for medical images. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that make use of weak annotations in the form of scribbles. However, these approaches require large amounts of scribble annotations, and are only applied to the segmentation of regular organs, which are often unavailable for the disease species that fall in the long-tailed distribution. Motivated by the fact that the medical labels have anatomy distribution priors, we propose a scribble-supervised clustering-based framework, called MedCL, to learn the inherent anatomy distribution of medical labels. Our approach consists of two steps: i) Mix the features with intra- and inter-image mix operations, and ii) Perform feature clustering and regularize the anatomy distribution at both local and global levels. Combined with a small amount of weak supervision, the proposed MedCL is able to segment both regular organs and challenging irregular pathologies. We implement MedCL based on SAM and UNet backbones, and evaluate the performance on three open datasets of regular structure (MSCMRseg), multiple organs (BTCV) and irregular pathology (MyoPS). It is shown that even with less scribble supervision, MedCL substantially outperforms the conventional segmentation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BWGZK/MedCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Yu, Juze Zhang, Changan Chen, Tiange Xiang, Yusu Fang, Juan Carlos Niebles, Ehsan Adeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Human interactions in everyday life are inherently social, involving engagements with diverse individuals across various contexts. Modeling these social interactions is fundamental to a wide range of real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce SocialGen, the first unified motion-language model capable of modeling interaction behaviors among varying numbers of individuals, to address this crucial yet challenging problem. Unlike prior methods that are limited to two-person interactions, we propose a novel social motion representation that supports tokenizing the motions of an arbitrary number of individuals and aligning them with the language space. This alignment enables the model to leverage rich, pretrained linguistic knowledge to better understand and reason about human social behaviors. To tackle the challenges of data scarcity, we curate a comprehensive multi-human interaction dataset, SocialX, enriched with textual annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-human interaction tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across motion-language tasks, setting a new standard for multi-human interaction modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anas Berka, Mohamed El Hajji, Raphael Canals, Youssef Es-saady, Adel Hafiane</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial and satellite imagery are inherently complementary remote sensing sources, offering high-resolution detail alongside expansive spatial coverage. However, the use of these sources for land cover segmentation introduces several challenges, prompting the development of a variety of segmentation methods. Among these approaches, the DeepLabV3+ architecture is considered as a promising approach in the field of single-source image segmentation. However, despite its reliable results for segmentation, there is still a need to increase its robustness and improve its performance. This is particularly crucial for multimodal image segmentation, where the fusion of diverse types of information is essential.
  An interesting approach involves enhancing this architectural framework through the integration of novel components and the modification of certain internal processes.
  In this paper, we enhance the DeepLabV3+ architecture by introducing a new transposed conventional layers block for upsampling a second entry to fuse it with high level features. This block is designed to amplify and integrate information from satellite images, thereby enriching the segmentation process through fusion with aerial images.
  For experiments, we used the LandCover.ai (Land Cover from Aerial Imagery) dataset for aerial images, alongside the corresponding dataset sourced from Sentinel 2 data.
  Through the fusion of both sources, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) achieved a total mIoU of 84.91% without data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liang, Yogesh S Rawat</p>
<p>Abstract: Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals under different clothing scenarios. Current CC-ReID approaches either concentrate on modeling body shape using additional modalities including silhouette, pose, and body mesh, potentially causing the model to overlook other critical biometric traits such as gender, age, and style, or they incorporate supervision through additional labels that the model tries to disregard or emphasize, such as clothing or personal attributes. However, these annotations are discrete in nature and do not capture comprehensive descriptions.
  In this work, we propose DIFFER: Disentangle Identity Features From Entangled Representations, a novel adversarial learning method that leverages textual descriptions to disentangle identity features. Recognizing that image features inherently mix inseparable information, DIFFER introduces NBDetach, a mechanism designed for feature disentanglement by leveraging the separable nature of text descriptions as supervision. It partitions the feature space into distinct subspaces and, through gradient reversal layers, effectively separates identity-related features from non-biometric features. We evaluate DIFFER on 4 different benchmark datasets (LTCC, PRCC, CelebreID-Light, and CCVID) to demonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across all the benchmarks. DIFFER consistently outperforms the baseline method, with improvements in top-1 accuracy of 3.6% on LTCC, 3.4% on PRCC, 2.5% on CelebReID-Light, and 1% on CCVID. Our code can be found here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei-Kai Huang, Jun-Xiong Chong, Ming-Tsung Hsu, Fang-Yu Hsu, Yi-Ting Lin, Kai-Heng Chien, Hao-Chiang Shao, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) techniques aim to enhance the security of facial identity authentication by distinguishing authentic live faces from deceptive attempts. While two-class FAS methods risk overfitting to training attacks to achieve better performance, one-class FAS approaches handle unseen attacks well but are less robust to domain information entangled within the liveness features. To address this, we propose an Unsupervised Feature Disentanglement and Augmentation Network (\textbf{UFDANet}), a one-class FAS technique that enhances generalizability by augmenting face images via disentangled features. The \textbf{UFDANet} employs a novel unsupervised feature disentangling method to separate the liveness and domain features, facilitating discriminative feature learning. It integrates an out-of-distribution liveness feature augmentation scheme to synthesize new liveness features of unseen spoof classes, which deviate from the live class, thus enhancing the representability and discriminability of liveness features. Additionally, \textbf{UFDANet} incorporates a domain feature augmentation routine to synthesize unseen domain features, thereby achieving better generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{UFDANet} outperforms previous one-class FAS methods and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art two-class FAS methods.</p>

Like E-MVFCM, EB-MVFCM present explicit forms of the H-KC to simplify the generation of the heat-kernel $\mathcal{K}(t)$ in powers of the proper time $t$ during the clustering process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei-Kai Huanga, Jun-Xiong Chong, Ming-Tsung Hsu, Fang-Yu Hsu, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) heavily relies on identifying live/spoof discriminative features to counter face presentation attacks. Recently, we proposed LDCformer to successfully incorporate the Learnable Descriptive Convolution (LDC) into ViT, to model long-range dependency of locally descriptive features for FAS. In this paper, we propose three novel training strategies to effectively enhance the training of LDCformer to largely boost its feature characterization capability. The first strategy, dual-attention supervision, is developed to learn fine-grained liveness features guided by regional live/spoof attentions. The second strategy, self-challenging supervision, is designed to enhance the discriminability of the features by generating challenging training data. In addition, we propose a third training strategy, transitional triplet mining strategy, through narrowing the cross-domain gap while maintaining the transitional relationship between live and spoof features, to enlarge the domain-generalization capability of LDCformer. Extensive experiments show that LDCformer under joint supervision of the three novel training strategies outperforms previous methods.</p>

In recent years, learning-based approaches have demonstrated superior robustness over traditional handcrafted methods in feature detection and matching, particularly under aggressive motion and HDR scenarios. In this paper, we propose SuperEIO, a novel framework that leverages the learning-based event-only detection and IMU measurements to achieve event-inertial odometry. Our event-only feature detection employs a convolutional neural network under continuous event streams. Moreover, our system adopts the graph neural network to achieve event descriptor matching for loop closure. The proposed system utilizes TensorRT to accelerate the inference speed of deep networks, which ensures low-latency processing and robust real-time operation on resource-limited platforms. Besides, we evaluate our method extensively on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art event-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Mueller, Yechan Kim, Trevor Gee, Mahla Nejati</p>
<p>Abstract: The global warehousing industry is experiencing rapid growth, with the market size projected to grow at an annual rate of 8.1% from 2024 to 2030 [Grand View Research, 2021]. This expansion has led to a surge in demand for efficient pallet detection and localisation systems. While automation can significantly streamline warehouse operations, the development of such systems often requires extensive manual data annotation, with an average of 35 seconds per image, for a typical computer vision project. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance pallet detection and localisation using purely synthetic data and geometric features derived from their side faces. By implementing a domain randomisation engine in Unity, the need for time-consuming manual annotation is eliminated while achieving high-performance results. The proposed method demonstrates a pallet detection performance of 0.995 mAP50 for single pallets on a real-world dataset. Additionally, an average position accuracy of less than 4.2 cm and an average rotation accuracy of 8.2{\deg} were achieved for pallets within a 5-meter range, with the pallet positioned head-on.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashesh Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuowei Li, Tianchen Zhao, Xiang Xu, Zheng Zhang, Zhihua Li, Xuanbai Chen, Qin Zhang, Alessandro Bergamo, Anil K. Jain, Yifan Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing a face anti-spoofing model that meets the security requirements of clients worldwide is challenging due to the domain gap between training datasets and diverse end-user test data. Moreover, for security and privacy reasons, it is undesirable for clients to share a large amount of their face data with service providers. In this work, we introduce a novel method in which the face anti-spoofing model can be adapted by the client itself to a target domain at test time using only a small sample of data while keeping model parameters and training data inaccessible to the client. Specifically, we develop a prototype-based base model and an optimal transport-guided adaptor that enables adaptation in either a lightweight training or training-free fashion, without updating base model's parameters. Furthermore, we propose geodesic mixup, an optimal transport-based synthesis method that generates augmented training data along the geodesic path between source prototypes and target data distribution. This allows training a lightweight classifier to effectively adapt to target-specific characteristics while retaining essential knowledge learned from the source domain. In cross-domain and cross-attack settings, compared with recent methods, our method achieves average relative improvements of 19.17% in HTER and 8.58% in AUC, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsong Wang, Tianxin Huang, Hanlin Chen, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoigi Seo, Junseo Bang, Haechang Lee, Joohoon Lee, Byung Hyun Lee, Se Young Chun</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models often suffer from text-image misalignment in complex scenes involving multiple objects and attributes. Semantic binding aims to mitigate this issue by accurately associating the generated attributes and objects with their corresponding noun phrases (NPs). Existing methods rely on text or latent optimizations, yet the factors influencing semantic binding remain underexplored. Here we investigate the geometrical properties of text token embeddings and their cross-attention (CA) maps. We empirically and theoretically analyze that the geometrical properties of token embeddings, specifically both angular distances and norms, play a crucial role in CA map differentiation. Then, we propose \textbf{TeeMo}, a training-free text embedding-aware T2I framework with strong semantic binding. TeeMo consists of Causality-Aware Projection-Out (CAPO) for distinct inter-NP CA maps and Adaptive Token Mixing (ATM) with our loss to enhance inter-NP separation while maintaining intra-NP cohesion in CA maps. Extensive experiments confirm TeeMo consistently outperforms prior arts across diverse baselines and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlei Shao, Hongruixuan Chen, Fan Zhao, Kirsty Magson, Jundong Chen, Peiran Li, Jiaqi Wang, Jun Sasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Coral reef ecosystems provide essential ecosystem services, but face significant threats from climate change and human activities. Although advances in deep learning have enabled automatic classification of coral reef conditions, conventional deep models struggle to achieve high performance when processing complex underwater ecological images. Vision foundation models, known for their high accuracy and cross-domain generalizability, offer promising solutions. However, fine-tuning these models requires substantial computational resources and results in high carbon emissions. To address these challenges, adapter learning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have emerged as a solution. This study introduces an approach integrating the DINOv2 vision foundation model with the LoRA fine-tuning method. The approach leverages multi-temporal field images collected through underwater surveys at 15 dive sites at Koh Tao, Thailand, with all images labeled according to universal standards used in citizen science-based conservation programs. The experimental results demonstrate that the DINOv2-LoRA model achieved superior accuracy, with a match ratio of 64.77%, compared to 60.34% achieved by the best conventional model. Furthermore, incorporating LoRA reduced the trainable parameters from 1,100M to 5.91M. Transfer learning experiments conducted under different temporal and spatial settings highlight the exceptional generalizability of DINOv2-LoRA across different seasons and sites. This study is the first to explore the efficient adaptation of foundation models for multi-label classification of coral reef conditions under multi-temporal and multi-spatial settings. The proposed method advances the classification of coral reef conditions and provides a tool for monitoring, conserving, and managing coral reef ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tissue detection is a crucial first step in most digital pathology applications. Details of the segmentation algorithm are rarely reported, and there is a lack of studies investigating the downstream effects of a poor segmentation algorithm. Disregarding tissue detection quality could create a bottleneck for downstream performance and jeopardize patient safety if diagnostically relevant parts of the specimen are excluded from analysis in clinical applications.
  This study aims to determine whether performance of downstream tasks is sensitive to the tissue detection method, and to compare performance of classical and AI-based tissue detection. To this end, we trained an AI model for Gleason grading of prostate cancer in whole slide images (WSIs) using two different tissue detection algorithms: thresholding (classical) and UNet++ (AI). A total of 33,823 WSIs scanned on five digital pathology scanners were used to train the tissue detection AI model. The downstream Gleason grading algorithm was trained and tested using 70,524 WSIs from 13 clinical sites scanned on 13 different scanners.
  There was a decrease from 116 (0.43%) to 22 (0.08%) fully undetected tissue samples when switching from thresholding-based tissue detection to AI-based, suggesting an AI model may be more reliable than a classical model for avoiding total failures on slides with unusual appearance. On the slides where tissue could be detected by both algorithms, no significant difference in overall Gleason grading performance was observed. However, tissue detection dependent clinically significant variations in AI grading were observed in 3.5% of malignant slides, highlighting the importance of robust tissue detection for optimal clinical performance of diagnostic AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianglong He, Junyi Chen, Di Huang, Zexiang Liu, Xiaoshui Huang, Wanli Ouyang, Chun Yuan, Yangguang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of 3D content creation, achieving optimal mesh topology through AI models has long been a pursuit for 3D artists. Previous methods, such as MeshGPT, have explored the generation of ready-to-use 3D objects via mesh auto-regressive techniques. While these methods produce visually impressive results, their reliance on token-by-token predictions in the auto-regressive process leads to several significant limitations. These include extremely slow generation speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we introduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh generation, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete triangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a transformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens and decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the diffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology, MeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds compared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an 800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35$\times$ faster than existing baselines). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset and demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with existing conditional guidance strategies, showcasing its potential to relieve artists from the time-consuming manual work involved in mesh creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Yuan, Yibo Peng, Jinke Ren, Yinghong Liao, Yatong Han, Chun-Mei Feng, Hengshuang Zhao, Guanbin Li, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by the great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the 2D image domain, their applications in 3D scene understanding has emerged as a new trend. A key difference between 3D and 2D is that the situation of an egocentric observer in 3D scenes can change, resulting in different descriptions (e.g., ''left" or ''right"). However, current LLM-based methods overlook the egocentric perspective and simply use datasets from a global viewpoint. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate a situation-aware dataset by leveraging the scanning trajectory during data collection and utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce high-quality captions and question-answer pairs. Furthermore, we introduce a situation grounding module to explicitly predict the position and orientation of observer's viewpoint, thereby enabling LLMs to ground situation description in 3D scenes. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, demonstrating that our method effectively enhances the 3D situational awareness of LLMs while significantly expanding existing datasets and reducing manual effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajie Jiang, Zhengxian Li, Xiaohan Yu, Yongli Hu, Baocai Yin, Jian Yang, Yuankai Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized zero-shot learning aims to recognize both seen and unseen classes with the help of semantic information that is shared among different classes. It inevitably requires consistent visual-semantic alignment. Existing approaches fine-tune the visual backbone by seen-class data to obtain semantic-related visual features, which may cause overfitting on seen classes with a limited number of training images. This paper proposes a novel visual and semantic prompt collaboration framework, which utilizes prompt tuning techniques for efficient feature adaptation. Specifically, we design a visual prompt to integrate the visual information for discriminative feature learning and a semantic prompt to integrate the semantic formation for visualsemantic alignment. To achieve effective prompt information integration, we further design a weak prompt fusion mechanism for the shallow layers and a strong prompt fusion mechanism for the deep layers in the network. Through the collaboration of visual and semantic prompts, we can obtain discriminative semantic-related features for generalized zero-shot image recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves favorable performance in both conventional zero-shot learning and generalized zero-shot learning benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Bao, Huijie Liu, Xun Gao, Huan Fu, Guoliang Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Naive DDIM inversion process usually suffers from a trajectory deviation issue, i.e., the latent trajectory during reconstruction deviates from the one during inversion. To alleviate this issue, previous methods either learn to mitigate the deviation or design cumbersome compensation strategy to reduce the mismatch error, exhibiting substantial time and computation cost. In this work, we present a nearly free-lunch method (named FreeInv) to address the issue more effectively and efficiently. In FreeInv, we randomly transform the latent representation and keep the transformation the same between the corresponding inversion and reconstruction time-step. It is motivated from a statistical perspective that an ensemble of DDIM inversion processes for multiple trajectories yields a smaller trajectory mismatch error on expectation. Moreover, through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that FreeInv performs an efficient ensemble of multiple trajectories. FreeInv can be freely integrated into existing inversion-based image and video editing techniques. Especially for inverting video sequences, it brings more significant fidelity and efficiency improvements. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation on PIE benchmark and DAVIS dataset shows that FreeInv remarkably outperforms conventional DDIM inversion, and is competitive among previous state-of-the-art inversion methods, with superior computation efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Ding, Mingdie Xiong, Congcong Zhu, Jingrun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing audio-driven visual dubbing methods have achieved great success. Despite this, we observe that the semantic ambiguity between spatial and temporal domains significantly degrades the synthesis stability for the dynamic faces. We argue that aligning the semantic features from spatial and temporal domains is a promising approach to stabilizing facial motion. To achieve this, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Alignment (STSA) method, which introduces a dual-path alignment mechanism and a differentiable semantic representation. The former leverages a Consistent Information Learning (CIL) module to maximize the mutual information at multiple scales, thereby reducing the manifold differences between spatial and temporal domains. The latter utilizes probabilistic heatmap as ambiguity-tolerant guidance to avoid the abnormal dynamics of the synthesized faces caused by slight semantic jittering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STSA, especially in terms of image quality and synthesis stability.

<p>Abstract: Despite its significant achievements in large-scale scene reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting still faces substantial challenges, including slow processing, high computational costs, and limited geometric accuracy. These core issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of efficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we introduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized hybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely. This implies that CityGS-X is far beyond the capacity of other existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Eppel, Mor Bismut, Alona Faktor</p>
<p>Abstract: Shape and texture recognition is fundamental to visual perception. The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures independently of their associated objects, is essential for general visual understanding of the world. We introduce the Large Shape & Textures dataset (LAS&T), a giant collection of diverse shapes and textures automatically extracted from real-world images. This dataset is used to evaluate how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) understand shapes, textures, and materials in both 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test models' ability to match identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that LVLMs' shape identification capabilities remain significantly below human performance. Single alterations (orientation, texture) cause minor decreases in matching accuracy, while multiple changes precipitate dramatic drops. LVLMs appear to rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking clear class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluate models' ability to identify identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler 2D textures. The LAS&T dataset and benchmark, the largest and most diverse resource for shape and texture evaluation, is freely available with generation and testing scripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with puzzles, which require precise perception, rule comprehension, and logical reasoning. Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones. We will release VGRP-Bench to facilitate further research on LVLMs for complex, real-world problem-solving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tablets and styluses are increasingly popular for taking notes. To optimize this experience and ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, it's important to develop methods for accurately interpreting and understanding the content of handwritten digital notes. We introduce a foundational model called InkFM for analyzing full pages of handwritten content. Trained on a diverse mixture of tasks, this model offers a unique combination of capabilities: recognizing text in 28 different scripts, mathematical expressions recognition, and segmenting pages into distinct elements like text and drawings. Our results demonstrate that these tasks can be effectively unified within a single model, achieving SoTA text line segmentation out-of-the-box quality surpassing public baselines like docTR. Fine- or LoRA-tuning our base model on public datasets further improves the quality of page segmentation, achieves state-of the art text recognition (DeepWriting, CASIA, SCUT, and Mathwriting datasets) and sketch classification (QuickDraw). This adaptability of InkFM provides a powerful starting point for developing applications with handwritten input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan Moughnieh, Mohamad Chalhoub, Hasan Nasrallah, Cristiano Nattero, Paolo Campanella, Ali J. Ghandour</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), offering remarkable capabilities across multi-modal domains. Their ability to precisely locate objects in complex aerial and satellite images, using rich contextual information and detailed object descriptions, is essential for remote sensing (RS). These models can associate textual descriptions with object positions through the Visual Grounding (VG) task, but due to domain-specific challenges, their direct application to RS produces sub-optimal results. To address this, we applied Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt these models for RS-specific VG tasks. Specifically, we evaluated LoRA placement across different modules in Grounding DINO and used BitFit and adapters to fine-tune the OFA foundation model pre-trained on general-purpose VG datasets. This approach achieved performance comparable to or surpassing current State Of The Art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing computational costs. This study highlights the potential of PEFT techniques to advance efficient and precise multi-modal analysis in RS, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to full model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Boscolo Camiletto, Jian Wang, Eduardo Alvarado, Rishabh Dabral, Thabo Beeler, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric motion capture with a head-mounted body-facing stereo camera is crucial for VR and AR applications but presents significant challenges such as heavy occlusions and limited annotated real-world data. Existing methods rely on synthetic pretraining and struggle to generate smooth and accurate predictions in real-world settings, particularly for lower limbs. Our work addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight VR-based data collection setup with on-board, real-time 6D pose tracking. Using this setup, we collected the most extensive real-world dataset for ego-facing ego-mounted cameras to date in size and motion variability. Effectively integrating this multimodal input -- device pose and camera feeds -- is challenging due to the differing characteristics of each data source. To address this, we propose FRAME, a simple yet effective architecture that combines device pose and camera feeds for state-of-the-art body pose prediction through geometrically sound multimodal integration and can run at 300 FPS on modern hardware. Lastly, we showcase a novel training strategy to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Our approach exploits the problem's geometric properties, yielding high-quality motion capture free from common artifacts in prior works. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations, along with extensive comparisons, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Xu, Vineet Kamat, Carol Menassa</p>
<p>Abstract: The global rise in the number of people with physical disabilities, in part due to improvements in post-trauma survivorship and longevity, has amplified the demand for advanced assistive technologies to improve mobility and independence. Autonomous assistive robots, such as smart wheelchairs, require robust capabilities in spatial segmentation and semantic recognition to navigate complex built environments effectively. Place segmentation involves delineating spatial regions like rooms or functional areas, while semantic recognition assigns semantic labels to these regions, enabling accurate localization to user-specific needs. Existing approaches often utilize deep learning; however, these close-vocabulary detection systems struggle to interpret intuitive and casual human instructions. Additionally, most existing methods ignore the uncertainty of the scene recognition problem, leading to low success rates, particularly in ambiguous and complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose an open-vocabulary scene semantic segmentation and detection pipeline leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach follows a 'Segment Detect Select' framework for open-vocabulary scene classification, enabling adaptive and intuitive navigation for assistive robots in built environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Tao, Dandan Zhong, Weiliang Mu, Zhuofei Du, Haiyang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment.It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language,as a structured knowledge carrier,can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution,and surrounding environmental information.Therefore,a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland.However,in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland,there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction.To fill this gap,we introduced language based descriptions of farmland and developed FarmSeg-VL dataset,the first fine-grained image-text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation.Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign caption to each image, ensuring high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction.Secondly,the FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics.In terms of the temporal dimension,it covers all four seasons.In terms of the spatial dimension,it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China.In addition, in terms of captions,FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland,including its inherent properties,phenological characteristics, spatial distribution,topographic and geomorphic features,and the distribution of surrounding environments.Finally,we present a performance analysis of VLMs and the deep learning models that rely solely on labels trained on the FarmSeg-VL,demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolu Liu, Ruizi Yang, Song Wang, Wentong Li, Junbo Chen, Jianke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable high-definition (HD) map construction is crucial for the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Although recent studies demonstrate improved performance, their generalization capability across unfamiliar driving scenes remains unexplored. To tackle this issue, we propose UIGenMap, an uncertainty-instructed structure injection approach for generalizable HD map vectorization, which concerns the uncertainty resampling in statistical distribution and employs explicit instance features to reduce excessive reliance on training data. Specifically, we introduce the perspective-view (PV) detection branch to obtain explicit structural features, in which the uncertainty-aware decoder is designed to dynamically sample probability distributions considering the difference in scenes. With probabilistic embedding and selection, UI2DPrompt is proposed to construct PV-learnable prompts. These PV prompts are integrated into the map decoder by designed hybrid injection to compensate for neglected instance structures. To ensure real-time inference, a lightweight Mimic Query Distillation is designed to learn from PV prompts, which can serve as an efficient alternative to the flow of PV branches. Extensive experiments on challenging geographically disjoint (geo-based) data splits demonstrate that our UIGenMap achieves superior performance, with +5.7 mAP improvement on the nuScenes dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohong Huang, Ling-An Zeng, Zexin Zheng, Shengbo Gu, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for generating text-guided human-object interactions (HOIs) that achieves explicit joint-level interaction modeling in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods represent the entire human body as a single token, making it difficult to capture fine-grained joint-level interactions and resulting in unrealistic HOIs. However, treating each individual joint as a token would yield over twenty times more tokens, increasing computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce an Efficient Explicit Joint-level Interaction Model (EJIM). EJIM features a Dual-branch HOI Mamba that separately and efficiently models spatiotemporal HOI information, as well as a Dual-branch Condition Injector for integrating text semantics and object geometry into human and object motions. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Interaction Block and a progressive masking mechanism to iteratively filter out irrelevant joints, ensuring accurate and nuanced interaction modeling. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that EJIM surpasses previous works by a large margin while using only 5\% of the inference time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Fu, Andrew Jun Lee, Anna Wang, Ida Momennejad, Trevor Bihl, Hongjing Lu, Taylor W. Webb</p>
<p>Abstract: The visual world is fundamentally compositional. Visual scenes are defined by the composition of objects and their relations. Hence, it is essential for computer vision systems to reflect and exploit this compositionality to achieve robust and generalizable scene understanding. While major strides have been made toward the development of general-purpose, multimodal generative models, including both text-to-image models and multimodal vision-language models, it remains unclear whether these systems are capable of accurately generating and interpreting scenes involving the composition of multiple objects and relations. In this work, we present an evaluation of the compositional visual processing capabilities in the current generation of text-to-image (DALL-E 3) and multimodal vision-language models (GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, QWEN2-VL-72B, and InternVL2.5-38B), and compare the performance of these systems to human participants. The results suggest that these systems display some ability to solve compositional and relational tasks, showing notable improvements over the previous generation of multimodal models, but with performance nevertheless well below the level of human participants, particularly for more complex scenes involving many ($>5$) objects and multiple relations. These results highlight the need for further progress toward compositional understanding of visual scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-V3, a recently emerging Large Language Model (LLM), demonstrates outstanding performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to its efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of DeepSeek-V3 in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our comprehensive evaluation results indicate that, when provided with specific prompts, DeepSeek-V3 performs well in surgical instrument and tissue recognition tasks However, DeepSeek-V3 exhibits significant limitations in spatial position analysis and struggles to understand surgical actions accurately. Additionally, our findings reveal that, under general prompts, DeepSeek-V3 lacks the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fails to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek-V3 is not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have increasingly emphasized document visual grounding to achieve better human-computer interaction, accessibility, and detailed understanding. However, its application to visualizations such as charts remains under-explored due to the inherent complexity of interleaved visual-numerical relationships in chart images. Existing chart understanding methods primarily focus on answering questions without explicitly identifying the visual elements that support their predictions. To bridge this gap, we introduce RefChartQA, a novel benchmark that integrates Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) with visual grounding, enabling models to refer elements at multiple granularities within chart images. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation by instruction-tuning 5 state-of-the-art VLMs across different categories. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating spatial awareness via grounding improves response accuracy by over 15%, reducing hallucinations, and improving model reliability. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing text-spatial alignment, such as architectural improvements in TinyChart, which leverages a token-merging module for enhanced feature fusion. Our dataset is open-sourced for community development and further advancements. All models and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/moured/RefChartQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision network designs, including Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, have significantly advanced the field of computer vision. Yet, their complex computations pose challenges for practical deployments, particularly in real-time applications. To tackle this issue, researchers have explored various lightweight and efficient network designs. However, existing lightweight models predominantly leverage self-attention mechanisms and convolutions for token mixing. This dependence brings limitations in effectiveness and efficiency in the perception and aggregation processes of lightweight networks, hindering the balance between performance and efficiency under limited computational budgets. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the dynamic heteroscale vision ability inherent in the efficient human vision system and propose a ``See Large, Focus Small'' strategy for lightweight vision network design. We introduce LS (\textbf{L}arge-\textbf{S}mall) convolution, which combines large-kernel perception and small-kernel aggregation. It can efficiently capture a wide range of perceptual information and achieve precise feature aggregation for dynamic and complex visual representations, thus enabling proficient processing of visual information. Based on LS convolution, we present LSNet, a new family of lightweight models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSNet achieves superior performance and efficiency over existing lightweight networks in various vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuo Liang, Zhe Hu, Jing Li, Hao Zhang, Yiren Lu, Yunlai Zhou, Yiran Qiao, Disheng Liu, Jeirui Peng, Jing Ma, Yu Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding humor-particularly when it involves complex, contradictory narratives that require comparative reasoning-remains a significant challenge for large vision-language models (VLMs). This limitation hinders AI's ability to engage in human-like reasoning and cultural expression. In this paper, we investigate this challenge through an in-depth analysis of comics that juxtapose panels to create humor through contradictions. We introduce the YesBut (V2), a novel benchmark with 1,262 comic images from diverse multilingual and multicultural contexts, featuring comprehensive annotations that capture various aspects of narrative understanding. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate a wide range of VLMs through four complementary tasks spanning from surface content comprehension to deep narrative reasoning, with particular emphasis on comparative reasoning between contradictory elements. Our extensive experiments reveal that even the most advanced models significantly underperform compared to humans, with common failures in visual perception, key element identification, comparative analysis and hallucinations. We further investigate text-based training strategies and social knowledge augmentation methods to enhance model performance. Our findings not only highlight critical weaknesses in VLMs' understanding of cultural and creative expressions but also provide pathways toward developing context-aware models capable of deeper narrative understanding though comparative reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Tang, Chaoran Feng, Xinhua Cheng, Wangbo Yu, Junwu Zhang, Yuan Liu, Xiaoxiao Long, Wenping Wang, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates superior quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. Recent 3DGS compression methods mainly concentrate on compressing Scaffold-GS, achieving impressive performance but with an additional voxel structure and a complex encoding and quantization strategy. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that explores in another way to compress the original 3DGS into a compact representation without the voxel structure and complex quantization strategies. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians with different tiny MLPs for each cluster, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 45-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality. The compression performance of our method on original 3DGS is comparable to the dedicated Scaffold-GS-based compression methods, which demonstrate the huge potential of directly compressing original 3DGS with neural fields.</p>

By integrating energy-efficient components, the proposed system effectively surpasses the challenges of remote and off-grid environments, ensuring uninterrupted operation in secluded locations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunoh Kim, Daeho Um</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised video grounding aims to localize temporal boundaries relevant to a given query without explicit ground-truth temporal boundaries. While existing methods primarily use Gaussian-based proposals, they overlook the importance of (1) boundary prediction and (2) top-1 prediction selection during inference. In their boundary prediction, boundaries are simply set at half a standard deviation away from a Gaussian mean on both sides, which may not accurately capture the optimal boundaries. In the top-1 prediction process, these existing methods rely heavily on intersections with other proposals, without considering the varying quality of each proposal. To address these issues, we explore various inference strategies by introducing (1) novel boundary prediction methods to capture diverse boundaries from multiple Gaussians and (2) new selection methods that take proposal quality into account. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets validate the effectiveness of our inference strategies, demonstrating performance improvements without requiring additional training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transmission latency significantly affects users' quality of experience in real-time interaction and actuation. As latency is principally inevitable, video prediction can be utilized to mitigate the latency and ultimately enable zero-latency transmission. However, most of the existing video prediction methods are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. In this work, we therefore propose real-time video prediction towards the zero-latency interaction over networks, called IFRVP (Intermediate Feature Refinement Video Prediction). Firstly, we propose three training methods for video prediction that extend frame interpolation models, where we utilize a simple convolution-only frame interpolation network based on IFRNet. Secondly, we introduce ELAN-based residual blocks into the prediction models to improve both inference speed and accuracy. Our evaluations show that our proposed models perform efficiently and achieve the best trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed among the existing video prediction methods.

<p>Abstract: Accurate rooftop detection from historical aerial imagery is vital for examining long-term urban development and human settlement patterns. However, black-and-white analog photographs pose significant challenges for modern object detection frameworks due to their limited spatial resolution, lack of color information, and archival degradation. To address these limitations, this study introduces a two-stage image enhancement pipeline based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): image colorization using DeOldify, followed by super-resolution enhancement with Real-ESRGAN. The enhanced images were then used to train and evaluate rooftop detection models, including Faster R-CNN, DETReg, and YOLOv11n. Results show that combining colorization with super-resolution substantially improves detection performance, with YOLOv11n achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) exceeding 85%. This reflects an improvement of approximately 40% over original black-and-white images and 20% over images enhanced through colorization alone. The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between archival imagery and contemporary deep learning techniques, enabling more reliable extraction of building footprints from historical aerial photographs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Gupta, Sunayana Rane, R. Thomas McCoy, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Gbouna Zakka, Zhuangzhuang Dai, Luis J. Manso</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing ageing population and their preference to maintain independence by living in their own homes require proactive strategies to ensure safety and support. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have emerged to facilitate ageing in place by offering continuous monitoring and assistance within the home. Within AAL technologies, action recognition plays a crucial role in interpreting human activities and detecting incidents like falls, mobility decline, or unusual behaviours that may signal worsening health conditions. However, action recognition in practical AAL applications presents challenges, including occlusions, noisy data, and the need for real-time performance. While advancements have been made in accuracy, robustness to noise, and computation efficiency, achieving a balance among them all remains a challenge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Robust and Efficient Temporal Convolution network (RE-TCN), which comprises three main elements: Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW), Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC), and data augmentation techniques. These elements aim to enhance the model's accuracy, robustness against noise and occlusion, and computational efficiency within real-world AAL contexts. RE-TCN outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, noise and occlusion robustness, and has been validated on four benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, Northwestern-UCLA, SHREC'17, and DHG-14/28.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc-Antoine Lavoie, Anas Mahmoud, Steven L. Waslander</p>
<p>Abstract: The current state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) use Mean Teacher self-labelling, where a teacher model, directly derived as an exponential moving average of the student model, is used to generate labels on the target domain which are then used to improve both models in a positive loop. This couples learning and generating labels on the target domain, and other recent works also leverage the generated labels to add additional domain alignment losses. We believe this coupling is brittle and excessively constrained: there is no guarantee that a student trained only on source data can generate accurate target domain labels and initiate the positive feedback loop, and much better target domain labels can likely be generated by using a large pretrained network that has been exposed to much more data. Vision foundational models are exactly such models, and they have shown impressive task generalization capabilities even when frozen. We want to leverage these models for DAOD and introduce DINO Teacher, which consists of two components. First, we train a new labeller on source data only using a large frozen DINOv2 backbone and show it generates more accurate labels than Mean Teacher. Next, we align the student's source and target image patch features with those from a DINO encoder, driving source and target representations closer to the generalizable DINO representation. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple DAOD datasets. Code available at https://github.com/TRAILab/DINO_Teacher</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Agrawal, Romi Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: The intersection of generative AI and art is a fascinating area that brings both exciting opportunities and significant challenges, especially when it comes to identifying synthetic artworks. This study takes a unique approach by examining diffusion-based generative models in the context of Indian art, specifically focusing on the distinctive style of Jamini Roy. To explore this, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion 3 and used techniques like ControlNet and IPAdapter to generate realistic images. This allowed us to create a new dataset that includes both real and AI-generated artworks, which is essential for a detailed analysis of what these models can produce. We employed various qualitative and quantitative methods, such as Fourier domain assessments and autocorrelation metrics, to uncover subtle differences between synthetic images and authentic pieces. A key takeaway from recent research is that existing methods for detecting deepfakes face considerable challenges, especially when the deepfakes are of high quality and tailored to specific cultural contexts. This highlights a critical gap in current detection technologies, particularly in light of the challenges identified above, where high-quality and culturally specific deepfakes are difficult to detect. This work not only sheds light on the increasing complexity of generative models but also sets a crucial foundation for future research aimed at effective detection of synthetic art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Borgi, Luca Maiano, Irene Amerini</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Z-SASLM, a Zero-Shot Style-Aligned SLI (Spherical Linear Interpolation) Blending Latent Manipulation pipeline that overcomes the limitations of current multi-style blending methods. Conventional approaches rely on linear blending, assuming a flat latent space leading to suboptimal results when integrating multiple reference styles. In contrast, our framework leverages the non-linear geometry of the latent space by using SLI Blending to combine weighted style representations. By interpolating along the geodesic on the hypersphere, Z-SASLM preserves the intrinsic structure of the latent space, ensuring high-fidelity and coherent blending of diverse styles - all without the need for fine-tuning. We further propose a new metric, Weighted Multi-Style DINO ViT-B/8, designed to quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the blended styles. While our primary focus is on the theoretical and practical advantages of SLI Blending for style manipulation, we also demonstrate its effectiveness in a multi-modal content fusion setting through comprehensive experimental studies. Experimental results show that Z-SASLM achieves enhanced and robust style alignment. The implementation code can be found at: https://github.com/alessioborgi/Z-SASLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahtab Jamali, Paul Davidsson, Reza Khoshkangini, Martin Georg Ljungqvist, Radu-Casian Mihailescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Context is an important factor in computer vision as it offers valuable information to clarify and analyze visual data. Utilizing the contextual information inherent in an image or a video can improve the precision and effectiveness of object detectors. For example, where recognizing an isolated object might be challenging, context information can improve comprehension of the scene. This study explores the impact of various context-based approaches to object detection. Initially, we investigate the role of context in object detection and survey it from several perspectives. We then review and discuss the most recent context-based object detection approaches and compare them. Finally, we conclude by addressing research questions and identifying gaps for further studies. More than 265 publications are included in this survey, covering different aspects of context in different categories of object detection, including general object detection, video object detection, small object detection, camouflaged object detection, zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot object detection. This literature review presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in context-based object detection, providing valuable contributions such as a thorough understanding of contextual information and effective methods for integrating various context types into object detection, thus benefiting researchers.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23257">FIESTA: Fisher Information-based Efficient Selective Test-time Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadmahdi Honarmand, Onur Cezmi Mutlu, Parnian Azizian, Saimourya Surabhi, Dennis P. Wall</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust facial expression recognition in unconstrained, "in-the-wild" environments remains challenging due to significant domain shifts between training and testing distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting pre-trained models during inference without requiring labeled test data. However, existing TTA approaches typically rely on manually selecting which parameters to update, potentially leading to suboptimal adaptation and high computational costs. This paper introduces a novel Fisher-driven selective adaptation framework that dynamically identifies and updates only the most critical model parameters based on their importance as quantified by Fisher information. By integrating this principled parameter selection approach with temporal consistency constraints, our method enables efficient and effective adaptation specifically tailored for video-based facial expression recognition. Experiments on the challenging AffWild2 benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing TTA methods, achieving a 7.7% improvement in F1 score over the base model while adapting only 22,000 parameters-more than 20 times fewer than comparable methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that parameter importance can be effectively estimated from minimal data, with sampling just 1-3 frames sufficient for substantial performance gains. The proposed approach not only enhances recognition accuracy but also dramatically reduces computational overhead, making test-time adaptation more practical for real-world affective computing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Cheng, Jinlu Zhang, Yue Liu, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human action recognition in low-light environments is crucial for various real-world applications. However, the existing approaches overlook the full utilization of brightness information throughout the training phase, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose OwlSight, a biomimetic-inspired framework with whole-stage illumination enhancement to interact with action classification for accurate dark video human action recognition. Specifically, OwlSight incorporates a Time-Consistency Module (TCM) to capture shallow spatiotemporal features meanwhile maintaining temporal coherence, which are then processed by a Luminance Adaptation Module (LAM) to dynamically adjust the brightness based on the input luminance distribution. Furthermore, a Reflect Augmentation Module (RAM) is presented to maximize illumination utilization and simultaneously enhance action recognition via two interactive paths. Additionally, we build Dark-101, a large-scale dataset comprising 18,310 dark videos across 101 action categories, significantly surpassing existing datasets (e.g., ARID1.5 and Dark-48) in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OwlSight achieves state-of-the-art performance across four low-light action recognition benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms previous best approaches by 5.36% on ARID1.5 and 1.72% on Dark-101, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging dark environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deeksha Arun, Kagan Ozturk, Kevin W. Bowyer, Patrick Flynn</p>
<p>Abstract: Ear recognition has emerged as a promising biometric modality due to the relative stability in appearance during adulthood. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely used in image recognition tasks, their efficiency in ear recognition has been hampered by a lack of attention to overlapping patches, which is crucial for capturing intricate ear features. In this study, we evaluate ViT-Tiny (ViT-T), ViT-Small (ViT-S), ViT-Base (ViT-B) and ViT-Large (ViT-L) configurations on a diverse set of datasets (OPIB, AWE, WPUT, and EarVN1.0), using an overlapping patch selection strategy. Results demonstrate the critical importance of overlapping patches, yielding superior performance in 44 of 48 experiments in a structured study. Moreover, upon comparing the results of the overlapping patches with the non-overlapping configurations, the increase is significant, reaching up to 10% for the EarVN1.0 dataset. In terms of model performance, the ViT-T model consistently outperformed the ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L models on the AWE, WPUT, and EarVN1.0 datasets. The highest scores were achieved in a configuration with a patch size of 28x28 and a stride of 14 pixels. This patch-stride configuration represents 25% of the normalized image area (112x112 pixels) for the patch size and 12.5% of the row or column size for the stride. This study confirms that transformer architectures with overlapping patch selection can serve as an efficient and high-performing option for ear-based biometric recognition tasks in verification scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Wimbauer, Weirong Chen, Dominik Muhle, Christian Rupprecht, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating camera motion and intrinsics from casual videos is a core challenge in computer vision. Traditional bundle-adjustment based methods, such as SfM and SLAM, struggle to perform reliably on arbitrary data. Although specialized SfM approaches have been developed for handling dynamic scenes, they either require intrinsics or computationally expensive test-time optimization and often fall short in performance. Recently, methods like Dust3r have reformulated the SfM problem in a more data-driven way. While such techniques show promising results, they are still 1) not robust towards dynamic objects and 2) require labeled data for supervised training. As an alternative, we propose AnyCam, a fast transformer model that directly estimates camera poses and intrinsics from a dynamic video sequence in feed-forward fashion. Our intuition is that such a network can learn strong priors over realistic camera poses. To scale up our training, we rely on an uncertainty-based loss formulation and pre-trained depth and flow networks instead of motion or trajectory supervision. This allows us to use diverse, unlabelled video datasets obtained mostly from YouTube. Additionally, we ensure that the predicted trajectory does not accumulate drift over time through a lightweight trajectory refinement step. We test AnyCam on established datasets, where it delivers accurate camera poses and intrinsics both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, even with trajectory refinement, AnyCam is significantly faster than existing works for SfM in dynamic settings. Finally, by combining camera information, uncertainty, and depth, our model can produce high-quality 4D pointclouds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Yu, Haoyu Han, Zhe Tao, Hantao Yao, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to enable learning systems to acquire new knowledge constantly without forgetting previously learned information. CL faces the challenge of mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining interpretability across tasks. Most existing CL methods focus primarily on preserving learned knowledge to improve model performance. However, as new information is introduced, the interpretability of the learning process becomes crucial for understanding the evolving decision-making process, yet it is rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that integrates language-guided Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to address both challenges. Our approach leverages the Concept Bottleneck Layer, aligning semantic consistency with CLIP models to learn human-understandable concepts that can generalize across tasks. By focusing on interpretable concepts, our method not only enhances the models ability to retain knowledge over time but also provides transparent decision-making insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving superior performance on several datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of up to 3.06% in final average accuracy on ImageNet-subset. Additionally, we offer concept visualizations for model predictions, further advancing the understanding of interpretable continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyang Liu, Yikai Wang, Sixiao Zheng, Tongying Pan, Longfei Liang, Yanwei Fu, Xiangyang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding and reasoning aim to localize objects in a scene based on implicit language descriptions, even when they are occluded. This ability is crucial for tasks such as vision-language navigation and autonomous robotics. However, current methods struggle because they rely heavily on fine-tuning with 3D annotations and mask proposals, which limits their ability to handle diverse semantics and common knowledge required for effective reasoning. In this work, we propose ReasonGrounder, an LVLM-guided framework that uses hierarchical 3D feature Gaussian fields for adaptive grouping based on physical scale, enabling open-vocabulary 3D grounding and reasoning. ReasonGrounder interprets implicit instructions using large vision-language models (LVLM) and localizes occluded objects through 3D Gaussian splatting. By incorporating 2D segmentation masks from the SAM and multi-view CLIP embeddings, ReasonGrounder selects Gaussian groups based on object scale, enabling accurate localization through both explicit and implicit language understanding, even in novel, occluded views. We also contribute ReasoningGD, a new dataset containing over 10K scenes and 2 million annotations for evaluating open-vocabulary 3D grounding and amodal perception under occlusion. Experiments show that ReasonGrounder significantly improves 3D grounding accuracy in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting human visuomotor coordination is crucial for applications in robotics, human-computer interaction, and assistive technologies. This work introduces a forecasting-based task for visuomotor modeling, where the goal is to predict head pose, gaze, and upper-body motion from egocentric visual and kinematic observations.

We extend a diffusion-based motion modeling framework that integrates egocentric vision and kinematic sequences, enabling temporally coherent and accurate visuomotor predictions. Our approach is evaluated on the large-scale EgoExo4D dataset, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse real-world activities. Our results highlight the importance of multimodal integration in understanding visuomotor coordination, contributing to research in visuomotor learning and human behavior modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have achieved impressive motion realism, yet they often overlook character-driven storytelling, a crucial task for automated film, animation generation. We introduce Talking Characters, a more realistic task to generate talking character animations directly from speech and text. Unlike talking head, Talking Characters aims at generating the full portrait of one or more characters beyond the facial region. In this paper, we propose MoCha, the first of its kind to generate talking characters. To ensure precise synchronization between video and speech, we propose a speech-video window attention mechanism that effectively aligns speech and video tokens. To address the scarcity of large-scale speech-labeled video datasets, we introduce a joint training strategy that leverages both speech-labeled and text-labeled video data, significantly improving generalization across diverse character actions. We also design structured prompt templates with character tags, enabling, for the first time, multi-character conversation with turn-based dialogue-allowing AI-generated characters to engage in context-aware conversations with cinematic coherence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including human preference studies and benchmark comparisons, demonstrate that MoCha sets a new standard for AI-generated cinematic storytelling, achieving superior realism, expressiveness, controllability and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshvardhan Takawale, Nirupam Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SpINR, a novel framework for volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar data. Traditional radar imaging techniques, such as backprojection, often assume ideal signal models and require dense aperture sampling, leading to limitations in resolution and generalization. To address these challenges, SpINR integrates a fully differentiable forward model that operates natively in the frequency domain with implicit neural representations (INRs). This integration leverages the linear relationship between beat frequency and scatterer distance inherent in FMCW radar systems, facilitating more efficient and accurate learning of scene geometry. Additionally, by computing outputs for only the relevant frequency bins, our forward model achieves greater computational efficiency compared to time-domain approaches that process the entire signal before transformation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SpINR significantly outperforms classical backprojection methods and existing learning-based approaches, achieving higher resolution and more accurate reconstructions of complex scenes. This work represents the first application of neural volumetic reconstruction in the radar domain, offering a promising direction for future research in radar-based imaging and perception systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxiang Jiang, Jihao Yin, Qixiong Wang, Jiaqi Feng, Guo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive results in various visual tasks. However, in remote sensing (RS), high resolution and small proportion of objects pose challenges to existing MLLMs, which struggle with object-centric tasks, particularly in precise localization and fine-grained attribute description for each object. These RS MLLMs have not yet surpassed classical visual perception models, as they only provide coarse image understanding, leading to limited gains in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we establish EagleVision, an MLLM tailored for remote sensing that excels in object detection and attribute comprehension. Equipped with the Attribute Disentangle module, EagleVision learns disentanglement vision tokens to express distinct attributes. To support object-level visual-language alignment, we construct EVAttrs-95K, the first large-scale object attribute understanding dataset in RS for instruction tuning, along with a novel evaluation benchmark, EVBench. EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on both fine-grained object detection and object attribute understanding tasks, highlighting the mutual promotion between detection and understanding capabilities in MLLMs. The code, model, data, and demo will be available at https://github.com/XiangTodayEatsWhat/EagleVision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Zheng, Han Li, Wenrui Dai, Ziyang Zheng, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods struggle with the occlusion issue by enriching information like temporal and visual cues in the lifting stage. In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Luo, Zhangyi Shen, Ye Yao, Feng Ding, Guopu Zhu, Weizhi Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation algorithms are increasingly integral to diverse aspects of human society, driven by their practical applications. However, insufficient oversight in artificial Intelligence generated content (AIGC) can facilitate the spread of malicious content and increase the risk of copyright infringement. Among the diverse range of image generation models, the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) is currently the most widely used, dominating the majority of the Text-to-Image model market. Currently, most attribution methods for LDMs rely on directly embedding watermarks into the generated images or their intermediate noise, a practice that compromises both the quality and the robustness of the generated content. To address these limitations, we introduce TraceMark-LDM, an novel algorithm that integrates watermarking to attribute generated images while guaranteeing non-destructive performance. Unlike current methods, TraceMark-LDM leverages watermarks as guidance to rearrange random variables sampled from a Gaussian distribution. To mitigate potential deviations caused by inversion errors, the small absolute elements are grouped and rearranged. Additionally, we fine-tune the LDM encoder to enhance the robustness of the watermark. Experimental results show that images synthesized using TraceMark-LDM exhibit superior quality and attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Notably, TraceMark-LDM demonstrates exceptional robustness against various common attack methods, consistently outperforming SOTA methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Spatting (3DGS) has gained widespread attention in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) due to the remarkable real-time rendering performance. However, the substantial cost of storage and transmission of vanilla 3DGS hinders its further application (hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes for a single scene). Motivated by the achievements of prediction in video compression, we introduce the prediction technique into the anchor-based Gaussian representation to effectively reduce the bit rate. Specifically, we propose a spatial condition-based prediction module to utilize the grid-captured scene information for prediction, with a residual compensation strategy designed to learn the missing fine-grained information. Besides, to further compress the residual, we propose an instance-aware hyper prior, developing a structure-aware and instance-aware entropy model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction-based compression framework and each technical component. Even compared with SOTA compression method, our framework still achieves a bit rate savings of 24.42 percent. Code is to be released!</p>

<p>Abstract: Comics have long been a popular form of storytelling, offering visually engaging narratives that captivate audiences worldwide. However, the visual nature of comics presents a significant barrier for visually impaired readers, limiting their access to these engaging stories. In this work, we provide a pragmatic solution to this accessibility challenge by developing an automated system that generates text-based literary narratives from manga comics. Our approach aims to create an evocative and immersive prose that not only conveys the original narrative but also captures the depth and complexity of characters, their interactions, and the vivid settings in which they reside.
  To this end we make the following contributions: (1) We present a unified model, Magiv3, that excels at various functional tasks pertaining to comic understanding, such as localising panels, characters, texts, and speech-bubble tails, performing OCR, grounding characters etc. (2) We release human-annotated captions for over 3300 Japanese comic panels, along with character grounding annotations, and benchmark large vision-language models in their ability to understand comic images. (3) Finally, we demonstrate how integrating large vision-language models with Magiv3, can generate seamless literary narratives that allows visually impaired audiences to engage with the depth and richness of comic storytelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyang Luo, Junhao Cheng, Yifan Xie, Xin Zhang, Tao Feng, Zhou Liu, Fei Ma, Fei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended story visualization is a challenging task that involves generating coherent image sequences from a given storyline. One of the main difficulties is maintaining character consistency while creating natural and contextually fitting scenes--an area where many existing methods struggle. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Transformer module that uses separate self attention and cross attention mechanisms, leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to ensure logical scene creation. The isolated self attention mechanism improves character consistency by refining attention maps to reduce focus on irrelevant areas and highlight key features of the same character. Meanwhile, the isolated cross attention mechanism independently processes each character's features, avoiding feature fusion and further strengthening consistency. Notably, our method is training-free, allowing the continuous generation of new characters and storylines without re-tuning. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms current methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linfeng Tang, Chunyu Li, Guoqing Wang, Yixuan Yuan, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing fusion methods are tailored for high-quality images but struggle with degraded images captured under harsh circumstances, thus limiting the practical potential of image fusion. This work presents a \textbf{D}egradation and \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{P}rior dual-guided framework for degraded image \textbf{Fusion} (\textbf{DSPFusion}), utilizing degradation priors and high-quality scene semantic priors restored via diffusion models to guide both information recovery and fusion in a unified model. In specific, it first individually extracts modality-specific degradation priors, while jointly capturing comprehensive low-quality semantic priors. Subsequently, a diffusion model is developed to iteratively restore high-quality semantic priors in a compact latent space, enabling our method to be over $20 \times$ faster than mainstream diffusion model-based image fusion schemes. Finally, the degradation priors and high-quality semantic priors are employed to guide information enhancement and aggregation via the dual-prior guidance and prior-guided fusion modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSPFusion mitigates most typical degradations while integrating complementary context with minimal computational cost, greatly broadening the application scope of image fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linfeng Tang, Yeda Wang, Zhanchuan Cai, Junjun Jiang, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image fusion methods struggle to address the composite degradations encountered in real-world imaging scenarios and lack the flexibility to accommodate user-specific requirements. In response to these challenges, we propose a controllable image fusion framework with language-vision prompts, termed ControlFusion, which adaptively neutralizes composite degradations. On the one hand, we develop a degraded imaging model that integrates physical imaging mechanisms, including the Retinex theory and atmospheric scattering principle, to simulate composite degradations, thereby providing potential for addressing real-world complex degradations from the data level. On the other hand, we devise a prompt-modulated restoration and fusion network that dynamically enhances features with degradation prompts, enabling our method to accommodate composite degradation of varying levels. Specifically, considering individual variations in quality perception of users, we incorporate a text encoder to embed user-specified degradation types and severity levels as degradation prompts. We also design a spatial-frequency collaborative visual adapter that autonomously perceives degradations in source images, thus eliminating the complete dependence on user instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ControlFusion outperforms SOTA fusion methods in fusion quality and degradation handling, particularly in countering real-world and compound degradations with various levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linfeng Tang, Yeda Wang, Meiqi Gong, Zizhuo Li, Yuxin Deng, Xunpeng Yi, Chunyu Li, Han Xu, Hao Zhang, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios and possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcun Yan, Jianqing Li, Peng Hang, Jian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization and the growth of transportation demands, the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs, such as pedestrians and cyclists) in mixed traffic flows has become increasingly prominent, necessitating high-precision and diverse trajectory data to support the development and optimization of autonomous driving systems. However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing. The dataset is publicly available for download at:

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Guo, Yawei Li, Taolin Zhang, Jiangshan Wang, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Luca Benini</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xindi Yang, Baolu Li, Yiming Zhang, Zhenfei Yin, Lei Bai, Liqian Ma, Zhiyong Wang, Jianfei Cai, Tien-Tsin Wong, Huchuan Lu, Xu Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Sun, Jing Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: In intelligent cartographic generation tasks empowered by generative models, the authenticity of synthesized maps constitutes a critical determinant. Concurrently, the selection of appropriate evaluation metrics to quantify map authenticity emerges as a pivotal research challenge. Current methodologies predominantly adopt computer vision-based image assessment metrics to compute discrepancies between generated and reference maps. However, conventional visual similarity metrics-including L1, L2, SSIM, and FID-primarily operate at pixel-level comparisons, inadequately capturing cartographic global features and spatial correlations, consequently inducing semantic-structural artifacts in generated outputs. This study introduces a novel Map Feature Perception Metric designed to evaluate global characteristics and spatial congruence between synthesized and target maps. Diverging from pixel-wise metrics, our approach extracts elemental-level deep features that comprehensively encode cartographic structural integrity and topological relationships. Experimental validation demonstrates MFP's superior capability in evaluating cartographic semantic features, with classification-enhanced implementations outperforming conventional loss functions across diverse generative frameworks. When employed as optimization objectives, our metric achieves performance gains ranging from 2% to 50% across multiple benchmarks compared to traditional L1, L2, and SSIM baselines. This investigation concludes that explicit consideration of cartographic global attributes and spatial coherence substantially enhances generative model optimization, thereby significantly improving the geographical plausibility of synthesized maps.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces JavisDiT, a novel Joint Audio-Video Diffusion Transformer designed for synchronized audio-video generation (JAVG). Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiduo Huang, Yadong Zhang, Pengju Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic convolution enhances model capacity by adaptively combining multiple kernels, yet faces critical trade-offs: prior works either (1) incur significant parameter overhead by scaling kernel numbers linearly, (2) compromise inference speed through complex kernel interactions, or (3) struggle to jointly optimize dynamic attention and static kernels. We also observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived ``child" layers generated from a shared ``parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter.
  To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23381">Enhancing Human Motion Prediction via Multi-range Decoupling Decoding with Gating-adjusting Aggregation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexin Wang, Wenwen Qiang, Zhao Yang, Bing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Expressive representation of pose sequences is crucial for accurate motion modeling in human motion prediction (HMP). While recent deep learning-based methods have shown promise in learning motion representations, these methods tend to overlook the varying relevance and dependencies between historical information and future moments, with a stronger correlation for short-term predictions and weaker for distant future predictions. This limits the learning of motion representation and then hampers prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called multi-range decoupling decoding with gating-adjusting aggregation ($MD2GA$), which leverages the temporal correlations to refine motion representation learning. This approach employs a two-stage strategy for HMP. In the first stage, a multi-range decoupling decoding adeptly adjusts feature learning by decoding the shared features into distinct future lengths, where different decoders offer diverse insights into motion patterns. In the second stage, a gating-adjusting aggregation dynamically combines the diverse insights guided by input motion data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into other motion prediction methods and enhance their prediction performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanding Huang, Jingyan Jiang, Qinting Jiang, Hebei Li, Faisal Nadeem Khan, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) face significant challenges in test-time adaptation to novel domains. While cache-based methods show promise by leveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable feature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during querying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances adaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and graph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: Dual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual Semantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating textual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2 features to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual graphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class relationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on cross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leander Girrbach, Stephan Alaniz, Genevieve Smith, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing use of image generation technology, understanding its social biases, including gender bias, is essential. This paper presents the first large-scale study on gender bias in text-to-image (T2I) models, focusing on everyday situations. While previous research has examined biases in occupations, we extend this analysis to gender associations in daily activities, objects, and contexts. We create a dataset of 3,217 gender-neutral prompts and generate 200 images per prompt from five leading T2I models. We automatically detect the perceived gender of people in the generated images and filter out images with no person or multiple people of different genders, leaving 2,293,295 images. To enable a broad analysis of gender bias in T2I models, we group prompts into semantically similar concepts and calculate the proportion of male- and female-gendered images for each prompt. Our analysis shows that T2I models reinforce traditional gender roles, reflect common gender stereotypes in household roles, and underrepresent women in financial related activities. Women are predominantly portrayed in care- and human-centered scenarios, and men in technical or physical labor scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zeng, Xuebin Chang, Jianghao Su, Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain generative models based on encoder-decoder AI architectures have attracted much attention in generating realistic images, where domain alignment is crucial for generation accuracy. Domain alignment methods usually deal directly with the initial distribution; however, mismatched or mixed clusters can lead to mode collapse and mixture problems in the decoder, compromising model generalization capabilities. In this work, we innovate a cross-domain alignment and generation model that introduces a canonical latent space representation based on geometric mapping to align the cross-domain latent spaces in a rigorous and precise manner, thus avoiding mode collapse and mixture in the encoder-decoder generation architectures. We name this model GMapLatent. The core of the method is to seamlessly align latent spaces with strict cluster correspondence constraints using the canonical parameterizations of cluster-decorated latent spaces. We first (1) transform the latent space to a canonical parameter domain by composing barycenter translation, optimal transport merging and constrained harmonic mapping, and then (2) compute geometric registration with cluster constraints over the canonical parameter domains. This process realizes a bijective (one-to-one and onto) mapping between newly transformed latent spaces and generates a precise alignment of cluster pairs. Cross-domain generation is then achieved through the aligned latent spaces embedded in the encoder-decoder pipeline. Experiments on gray-scale and color images validate the efficiency, efficacy and applicability of GMapLatent, and demonstrate that the proposed model has superior performance over existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zuo, Jiaran Jiang, Jifeng Shen, Wankou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater image understanding is crucial for both submarine navigation and seabed exploration. However, the low illumination in underwater environments degrades the imaging quality, which in turn seriously deteriorates the performance of underwater semantic segmentation, particularly for outlining the object region boundaries. To tackle this issue, we present UnderWater SegFormer (UWSegFormer), a transformer-based framework for semantic segmentation of low-quality underwater images. Firstly, we propose the Underwater Image Quality Attention (UIQA) module. This module enhances the representation of highquality semantic information in underwater image feature channels through a channel self-attention mechanism. In order to address the issue of loss of imaging details due to the underwater environment, the Multi-scale Aggregation Attention(MAA) module is proposed. This module aggregates sets of semantic features at different scales by extracting discriminative information from high-level features,thus compensating for the semantic loss of detail in underwater objects. Finally, during training, we introduce Edge Learning Loss (ELL) in order to enhance the model's learning of underwater object edges and improve the model's prediction accuracy. Experiments conducted on the SUIM and DUT-USEG (DUT) datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method has advantages in terms of segmentation completeness, boundary clarity, and subjective perceptual details when compared to SOTA methods. In addition, the proposed method achieves the highest mIoU of 82.12 and 71.41 on the SUIM and DUT datasets, respectively. Code will be available at https://github.com/SAWRJJ/UWSegFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongseo Lee, Joohyun Chang, Dongho Lee, Jinwoo Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention in Audio, Space, and Time (CA^2ST), a transformer-based method for holistic video recognition. Recognizing actions in videos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address this, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange information and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding, we extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in Visual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different characteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400, consistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on audio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound, KineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across these datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among multiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and CAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention, achieving balanced and holistic video understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Facial Action Units (AUs) detection is a cornerstone of objective facial expression analysis and a critical focus in affective computing. Despite its importance, AU detection faces significant challenges, such as the high cost of AU annotation and the limited availability of datasets. These constraints often lead to overfitting in existing methods, resulting in substantial performance degradation when applied across diverse datasets. Addressing these issues is essential for improving the reliability and generalizability of AU detection methods. Moreover, many current approaches leverage Transformers for their effectiveness in long-context modeling, but they are hindered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, Test-Time Training (TTT) layers have emerged as a promising solution for long-sequence modeling. Additionally, TTT applies self-supervised learning for iterative updates during both training and inference, offering a potential pathway to mitigate the generalization challenges inherent in AU detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision backbone tailored for AU detection, incorporating bidirectional TTT blocks, named AU-TTT. Our approach introduces TTT Linear to the AU detection task and optimizes image scanning mechanisms for enhanced performance. Additionally, we design an AU-specific Region of Interest (RoI) scanning mechanism to capture fine-grained facial features critical for AU detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both within-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aimira Baitieva, Yacine Bouaouni, Alexandre Briot, Dick Ameln, Souhaiel Khalfaoui, Samet Akcay</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for automating visual inspection in manufacturing. This field of computer vision is rapidly evolving, with increasing attention towards real-world applications. Meanwhile, popular datasets are typically produced in controlled lab environments with artificially created defects, unable to capture the diversity of real production conditions. New methods often fail in production settings, showing significant performance degradation or requiring impractical computational resources. This disconnect between academic results and industrial viability threatens to misdirect visual anomaly detection research. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we demonstrate the importance of real-world datasets and establish benchmarks using actual production data, (2) we provide a fair comparison of existing SOTA methods across diverse tasks by utilizing metrics that are valuable for practical applications, and (3) we present a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in this field by discussing important challenges and new perspectives for bridging the academia-industry gap.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Yang, Ke Fan, Shangkun Sun, Hongxiang Li, Ailing Zeng, FeiLin Han, Wei Zhai, Wei Liu, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of video generation has rendered existing evaluation systems inadequate for assessing state-of-the-art models, primarily due to simple prompts that cannot showcase the model's capabilities, fixed evaluation operators struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases, and misalignment between computed metrics and human preferences. To bridge the gap, we propose VideoGen-Eval, an agent evaluation system that integrates LLM-based content structuring, MLLM-based content judgment, and patch tools designed for temporal-dense dimensions, to achieve a dynamic, flexible, and expandable video generation evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a video generation benchmark to evaluate existing cutting-edge models and verify the effectiveness of our evaluation system. It comprises 700 structured, content-rich prompts (both T2V and I2V) and over 12,000 videos generated by 20+ models, among them, 8 cutting-edge models are selected as quantitative evaluation for the agent and human. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed agent-based evaluation system demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences and reliably completes the evaluation, as well as the diversity and richness of the benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maofu Liu, Jiahui Liu, Xiaokang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate semantically accurate descriptions that are closely linked to the visual features of remote sensing images. Existing approaches typically emphasize fine-grained extraction of visual features and capturing global information. However, they often overlook the complementary role of textual information in enhancing visual semantics and face challenges in precisely locating objects that are most relevant to the image context. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semantic-spatial feature fusion with dynamic graph refinement (SFDR) method, which integrates the semantic-spatial feature fusion (SSFF) and dynamic graph feature refinement (DGFR) modules. The SSFF module utilizes a multi-level feature representation strategy by leveraging pre-trained CLIP features, grid features, and ROI features to integrate rich semantic and spatial information. In the DGFR module, a graph attention network captures the relationships between feature nodes, while a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes objects that are most relevant to the current scene and suppresses less significant ones. Therefore, the proposed SFDR method significantly enhances the quality of the generated descriptions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The source code will be available at https://github.com/zxk688}{https://github.com/zxk688.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23455">Efficient Token Compression for Vision Transformer with Spatial Information Preserved</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhu Mao, Yang Shen, Jinyang Guo, Yazhou Yao, Xiansheng Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Token compression is essential for reducing the computational and memory requirements of transformer models, enabling their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose an efficient and hardware-compatible token compression method called Prune and Merge. Our approach integrates token pruning and merging operations within transformer models to achieve layer-wise token compression. By introducing trainable merge and reconstruct matrices and utilizing shortcut connections, we efficiently merge tokens while preserving important information and enabling the restoration of pruned tokens. Additionally, we introduce a novel gradient-weighted attention scoring mechanism that computes token importance scores during the training phase, eliminating the need for separate computations during inference and enhancing compression efficiency. We also leverage gradient information to capture the global impact of tokens and automatically identify optimal compression structures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-1k and ADE20K datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significant speed-ups with minimal accuracy degradation compared to state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on DeiT-Small, we achieve a 1.64$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.2\% drop in accuracy on ImageNet-1k. Moreover, by compressing segmenter models and comparing with existing methods, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maofu Liu, Xin Jiang, Xiaokang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is a challenging task, aiming to segment specific target objects in remote sensing (RS) images based on a given language expression. Existing RRSIS methods typically employ coarse-grained unidirectional alignment approaches to obtain multimodal features, and they often overlook the critical role of language features as contextual information during the decoding process. Consequently, these methods exhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features, leading to incomplete or erroneous predicted masks, especially when handling complex expressions and intricate RS image scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained cross-modal alignment and decoding Transformer, CADFormer, for RRSIS. Specifically, we design a semantic mutual guidance alignment module (SMGAM) to achieve both vision-to-language and language-to-vision alignment, enabling comprehensive integration of visual and textual features for fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, a textual-enhanced cross-modal decoder (TCMD) is introduced to incorporate language features during decoding, using refined textual information as context to enhance the relationship between cross-modal features. To thoroughly evaluate the performance of CADFormer, especially for inconspicuous targets in complex scenes, we constructed a new RRSIS dataset, called RRSIS-HR, which includes larger high-resolution RS image patches and semantically richer language expressions. Extensive experiments on the RRSIS-HR dataset and the popular RRSIS-D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CADFormer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglong Lu, Shen Liang, Xuewei Wang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have computational costs scaling quadratically with the number of tokens, calling for effective token pruning policies. Most existing policies are handcrafted, lacking adaptivity to varying inputs. Moreover, they fail to consider the sequential nature of token pruning across multiple layers. In this work, for the first time (as far as we know), we exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) to data-adaptively learn a pruning policy. Formulating token pruning as a sequential decision-making problem, we model it as a Markov Game and utilize Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) where each agent makes an individualized pruning decision for a single token. We also develop reward functions that enable simultaneous collaboration and competition of these agents to balance efficiency and accuracy. On the well-known ImageNet-1k dataset, our method improves the inference speed by up to 44% while incurring only a negligible accuracy drop of 0.4%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikai Du, Zhennan Chen, Zhizhou Chen, Shan Gao, Xi Chen, Zhengkai Jiang, Jian Yang, Ying Tai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the task of Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG), which centers on generating intricate textual content distributed across diverse regions within visual images. In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingcheng Zhou, Xuyuan Han, Feng Yang, Yunpu Ma, Alois C. Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: We present OpenDriveVLA, a Vision-Language Action (VLA) model designed for end-to-end autonomous driving. OpenDriveVLA builds upon open-source pre-trained large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate reliable driving actions, conditioned on 3D environmental perception, ego vehicle states, and driver commands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and language embeddings, we propose a hierarchical vision-language alignment process, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified semantic space. Besides, OpenDriveVLA models the dynamic relationships between the ego vehicle, surrounding agents, and static road elements through an autoregressive agent-env-ego interaction process, ensuring both spatially and behaviorally informed trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OpenDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across open-loop trajectory planning and driving-related question-answering tasks. Qualitative analyses further illustrate OpenDriveVLA's superior capability to follow high-level driving commands and robustly generate trajectories under challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for next-generation end-to-end autonomous driving. We will release our code to facilitate further research in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated patient positioning is a crucial step in streamlining MRI workflows and enhancing patient throughput. RGB-D camera-based systems offer a promising approach to automate this process by leveraging depth information to estimate internal organ positions. This paper investigates the feasibility of a learning-based framework to infer approximate internal organ positions from the body surface. Our approach utilizes a large-scale dataset of MRI scans to train a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting organ positions and shapes from depth images alone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in localization of multiple internal organs, including bones and soft tissues. Our findings suggest that RGB-D camera-based systems integrated into MRI workflows have the potential to streamline scanning procedures and improve patient experience by enabling accurate and automated patient positioning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23472">Efficient Dynamic Attention 3D Convolution for Hyperspectral Image Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guandong Li, Mengxia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including insufficient utilization of joint spatial-spectral information, gradient vanishing with increasing depth, and overfitting. To enhance feature extraction efficiency while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a dynamic attention convolution design based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The design employs multiple parallel convolutional kernels instead of a single kernel and assigns dynamic attention weights to these parallel convolutions. This dynamic attention mechanism achieves adaptive feature response based on spatial characteristics in the spatial dimension of hyperspectral images, focusing more on key spatial structures. In the spectral dimension, it enables dynamic discrimination of different bands, alleviating information redundancy and computational complexity caused by high spectral dimensionality. The DAC module enhances model representation capability by attention-based aggregation of multiple convolutional kernels without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both inference speed and accuracy, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashim Dahal, Saydul Akbar Murad, Nick Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the representation shift on Vision Language Models like CLIP under different augmentations provides valuable insights on Mechanistic Interpretability. In this study, we show the shift on CLIP's embeddings on 9 common augmentation techniques: noise, blur, color jitter, scale and rotate, flip, elastic and perspective transforms, random brightness and contrast, and coarse dropout of pixel blocks. We scrutinize the embedding shifts under similarity on attention map, patch, edge, detail preservation, cosine similarity, L2 distance, pairwise distance and dendrogram clusters and provide qualitative analysis on sample images. Our findings suggest certain augmentations like noise, perspective transform and shift scaling have higher degree of drastic impact on embedding shift. This study provides a concrete foundation for future work on VLM's robustness for mechanical interpretation and adversarial data defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jannik Endres, Oliver Hahn, Charles Corbi\`ere, Simone Schaub-Meyer, Stefan Roth, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siladittya Manna, Suresh Das, Sayantari Ghosh, Saumik Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized federated learning enables learning of data representations from multiple sources without compromising the privacy of the clients. In applications like medical image segmentation, where obtaining a large annotated dataset from a single source is a distressing problem, federated self-supervised learning can provide some solace. In this work, we push the limits further by exploring a federated self-supervised one-shot segmentation task representing a more data-scarce scenario. We adopt a pre-existing self-supervised few-shot segmentation framework CoWPro and adapt it to the federated learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to attempt a self-supervised few-shot segmentation task in the federated learning domain. Moreover, we consider the clients to be constituted of data from different modalities and imaging techniques like MR or CT, which makes the problem even harder. Additionally, we reinforce and improve the baseline CoWPro method using a fused dice loss which shows considerable improvement in performance over the baseline CoWPro. Finally, we evaluate this novel framework on a completely unseen held-out part of the local client dataset. We observe that the proposed framework can achieve performance at par or better than the FedAvg version of the CoWPro framework on the held-out validation dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Chen, Jiangyan Feng, Haodong Zhang, Lijun Gong, Feng Zhu, Rui Zhao, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng, Yibing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-based object detection (LOD) aims to align visual objects with language expressions. A large amount of paired data is utilized to improve LOD model generalizations. During the training process, recent studies leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically generate human-like expressions for visual objects, facilitating training data scaling up. In this process, we observe that VLM hallucinations bring inaccurate object descriptions (e.g., object name, color, and shape) to deteriorate VL alignment quality. To reduce VLM hallucinations, we propose an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM to re-align language to visual objects via adaptively adjusting image and text prompts. We name this workflow Real-LOD, which includes planning, tool use, and reflection steps. Given an image with detected objects and VLM raw language expressions, Real-LOD reasons its state automatically and arranges action based on our neural symbolic designs (i.e., planning). The action will adaptively adjust the image and text prompts and send them to VLMs for object re-description (i.e., tool use). Then, we use another LLM to analyze these refined expressions for feedback (i.e., reflection). These steps are conducted in a cyclic form to gradually improve language descriptions for re-aligning to visual objects. We construct a dataset that contains a tiny amount of 0.18M images with re-aligned language expression and train a prevalent LOD model to surpass existing LOD methods by around 50% on the standard benchmarks. Our Real-LOD workflow, with automatic VL refinement, reveals a potential to preserve data quality along with scaling up data quantity, which further improves LOD performance from a data-alignment perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haruya Ishikawa, Yoshimitsu Aoki</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current teacher-student consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, they often overlook a critical challenge: the precise delineation of object boundaries. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS-SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into the consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries. To further enhance performance and sharpen contours, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, leading to higher-quality boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets including Cityscapes, BDD100K, SYNTHIA, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC show that BoundMatch achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving boundary-specific evaluation metrics. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in realistic large-scale unlabeled data scenarios and on lightweight architectures designed for mobile deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhei Tarashima, Xinqi Shu, Norio Tagawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to a target dataset from a different domain without access to the source data. Conventional SFDA methods are limited by the information encoded in the pre-trained source model and the unlabeled target data. Recently, approaches leveraging auxiliary resources have emerged, yet remain in their early stages, offering ample opportunities for research. In this work, we propose a novel method that incorporates auxiliary information by extending an existing SFDA framework using Vision-and-Language (ViL) models. Specifically, we build upon Attracting and Dispersing (AaD), a widely adopted SFDA technique, and generalize its core principle to naturally integrate ViL models as a powerful initialization for target adaptation. Our approach, called ViL-enhanced AaD (ViLAaD), preserves the simplicity and flexibility of the AaD framework, while leveraging ViL models to significantly boost adaptation performance. We validate our method through experiments using various ViL models, demonstrating that ViLAaD consistently outperforms both AaD and zero-shot classification by ViL models, especially when both the source model and ViL model provide strong initializations. Moreover, the flexibility of ViLAaD allows it to be seamlessly incorporated into an alternating optimization framework with ViL prompt tuning and extended with additional objectives for target model adaptation. Extensive experiments on four SFDA benchmarks show that this enhanced version, ViLAaD++, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SFDA scenarios, including Closed-set SFDA, Partial-set SFDA, and Open-set SFDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafi Ibn Sultan, Hui Zhu, Chengyin Li, Dongxiao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation typically relies solely on visual data, overlooking the rich textual information clinicians use for diagnosis. Vision-language models attempt to bridge this gap, but existing approaches often process visual and textual features independently, resulting in weak cross-modal alignment. Simple fusion techniques fail due to the inherent differences between spatial visual features and sequential text embeddings. Additionally, medical terminology deviates from general language, limiting the effectiveness of off-the-shelf text encoders and further hindering vision-language alignment. We propose BiPVL-Seg, an end-to-end framework that integrates vision-language fusion and embedding alignment through architectural and training innovations, where both components reinforce each other to enhance medical image segmentation. BiPVL-Seg introduces bidirectional progressive fusion in the architecture, which facilitates stage-wise information exchange between vision and text encoders. Additionally, it incorporates global-local contrastive alignment, a training objective that enhances the text encoder's comprehension by aligning text and vision embeddings at both class and concept levels. Extensive experiments on diverse medical imaging benchmarks across CT and MR modalities demonstrate BiPVL-Seg's superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods in complex multi-class segmentation.

C3 selectively amplifies features during the denoising process to foster more creative outputs. We offer practical guidelines for choosing amplification factors based on two main aspects of creativity. C3 is the first study to enhance creativity in diffusion models without extensive computational costs. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various Stable Diffusion-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Augustin, Yannic Neuhaus, Matthias Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to object hallucinations, where they erroneously indicate the presenceof certain objects in an image. Existing benchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets. However, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise in open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for detecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to identify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an open-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval, where we optimize over the ''natural image manifold'' to generate images that mislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and semantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in total, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of the identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that fine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH mitigates object hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Fiore, Hongyi Fan, Benjamin Kimia</p>
<p>Abstract: The image retrieval (IR) approach to image localization has distinct advantages to the 3D and the deep learning (DNN) approaches: it is seen-agnostic, simpler to implement and use, has no privacy issues, and is computationally efficient. The main drawback of this approach is relatively poor localization in both position and orientation of the query camera when compared to the competing approaches. This paper represents a hybrid approach that stores only image features in the database like some IR methods, but relies on a latent 3D reconstruction, like 3D methods but without retaining a 3D scene reconstruction. The approach is based on two ideas: {\em (i)} a novel proposal where query camera center estimation relies only on relative translation estimates but not relative rotation estimates through a decoupling of the two, and {\em (ii)} a shift from computing optimal pose from estimated relative pose to computing optimal pose from multiview correspondences, thus cutting out the ``middle-man''. Our approach shows improved performance on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets while also improving on timing and memory footprint as compared to state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng-Peng Duan, Jiawei Zhang, Xin Jin, Ziheng Zhang, Zheng Xiong, Dongqing Zou, Jimmy Ren, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models are becoming increasingly popular in solving the Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) problem because of their rich generative priors. The recent development of diffusion transformer (DiT) has witnessed overwhelming performance over the traditional UNet-based architecture in image generation, which also raises the question: Can we adopt the advanced DiT-based diffusion model for Real-ISR? To this end, we propose our DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for Real-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from low-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into the original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of information between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient interaction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the diffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns with the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance is injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer, compensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These simple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in Real-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

<p>Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation from images is a key problem in object-centric scene understanding, enabling applications in robotics, augmented reality, and scene reconstruction. Despite recent advances, existing methods often produce physically inconsistent pose estimates, hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. We introduce PhysPose, a novel approach that integrates physical reasoning into pose estimation through a postprocessing optimization enforcing non-penetration and gravitational constraints. By leveraging scene geometry, PhysPose refines pose estimates to ensure physical plausibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the YCB-Video dataset from the BOP benchmark and improves over the state-of-the-art pose estimation methods on the HOPE-Video dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate its impact in robotics by significantly improving success rates in a challenging pick-and-place task, highlighting the importance of physical consistency in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xu, Charles James Wagner, Junjie Luo, Qi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting depth information from photon-limited, defocused images is challenging because depth from defocus (DfD) relies on accurate estimation of defocus blur, which is fundamentally sensitive to image noise. We present a novel approach to robustly measure object depths from photon-limited images along the defocused boundaries. It is based on a new image patch representation, Blurry-Edges, that explicitly stores and visualizes a rich set of low-level patch information, including boundaries, color, and smoothness. We develop a deep neural network architecture that predicts the Blurry-Edges representation from a pair of differently defocused images, from which depth can be calculated using a closed-form DfD relation we derive. The experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our method achieves the highest depth estimation accuracy on photon-limited images compared to a broad range of state-of-the-art DfD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance in guiding image generation through text, with emerging applications in medical imaging. In this work, we are the first to investigate the question: 'Can fine-tuned foundation models help identify critical, and possibly unknown, data properties?' By evaluating our proposed method on a chest x-ray dataset, we show that these models can generate high-resolution, precisely edited images compared to methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) according to numerous metrics. For the first time, we demonstrate that fine-tuned VLMs can reveal hidden data relationships that were previously obscured due to available metadata granularity and model capacity limitations. Our experiments demonstrate both the potential of these models to reveal underlying dataset properties while also exposing the limitations of fine-tuned VLMs for accurate image editing and susceptibility to biases and spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra TehraniNasab, Amar Kumar, Tal Arbel</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate photorealistic images from natural language prompts. These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Said Ohamouddou, Mohamed Ohamouddou, Hanaa El Afia, Abdellatif El Afia, Rafik Lasri, Raddouane Chiheb</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of tree species based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for biodiversity conservation. While advanced deep learning models for 3D point cloud classification have demonstrated strong performance in this domain, their high complexity often hinders the development of efficient, low-computation architectures. In this paper, we introduce STFT-KAN, a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold network that integrates the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which can replace the standard linear layer with activation. We implemented STFT-KAN within a lightweight version of DGCNN, called liteDGCNN, to classify tree species using the TLS data. Our experiments show that STFT-KAN outperforms existing KAN variants by effectively balancing model complexity and performance with parameter count reduction, achieving competitive results compared to MLP-based models. Additionally, we evaluated a hybrid architecture that combines MLP in edge convolution with STFT-KAN in other layers, achieving comparable performance to MLP models while reducing the parameter count by 50% and 75% compared to other KAN-based variants. Furthermore, we compared our model to leading 3D point cloud learning approaches, demonstrating that STFT-KAN delivers competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art method PointMLP lite with an 87% reduction in parameter count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zheng, Zihao Chen, Chaofan Ding, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Current movie dubbing technology can generate the desired voice from a given speech prompt, ensuring good synchronization between speech and visuals while accurately conveying the intended emotions. However, in movie dubbing, key aspects such as adapting to different dubbing styles, handling dialogue, narration, and monologue effectively, and understanding subtle details like the age and gender of speakers, have not been well studied. To address this challenge, we propose a framework of multi-modal large language model. First, it utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning methods on visual inputs to understand dubbing styles and fine-grained attributes. Second, it generates high-quality dubbing through large speech generation models, guided by multimodal conditions. Additionally, we have developed a movie dubbing dataset with CoT annotations. The evaluation results demonstrate a performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. In particular, for the evaluation metrics, the SPK-SIM and EMO-SIM increases from 82.48% to 89.74%, 66.24% to 78.88% for dubbing setting 2.0 on V2C Animation dataset, LSE-D and MCD-SL decreases from 14.79 to 14.63, 5.24 to 4.74 for dubbing setting 2.0 on Grid dataset, SPK-SIM increases from 64.03 to 83.42 and WER decreases from 52.69% to 23.20% for initial reasoning setting on proposed CoT-Movie-Dubbing dataset in the comparison with the state-of-the art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiko Tsuji, Hitoshi Niigaki, Ryuichi Tanida</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual localization is to estimate the 6-DOF camera pose of a query image in a 3D reference map. We extract keypoints from the reference image and generate a 3D reference map with 3D reconstruction of the keypoints in advance. We emphasize that the more keypoints in the 3D reference map and the smaller the error of the 3D positions of the keypoints, the higher the accuracy of the camera pose estimation. However, previous image-only methods require a huge number of images, and it is difficult to 3D-reconstruct keypoints without error due to inevitable mismatches and failures in feature matching. As a result, the 3D reference map is sparse and inaccurate. In contrast, accurate 3D reference maps can be generated by combining images and 3D sensors. Recently, 3D-LiDAR has been widely used around the world. LiDAR, which measures a large space with high density, has become inexpensive. In addition, accurately calibrated cameras are also widely used, so images that record the external parameters of the camera without errors can be easily obtained. In this paper, we propose a method to directly assign 3D LiDAR point clouds to keypoints to generate dense and accurate 3D reference maps. The proposed method avoids feature matching and achieves accurate 3D reconstruction for almost all keypoints. To estimate camera pose over a wide area, we use the wide-area LiDAR point cloud to remove points that are not visible to the camera and reduce 2D-3D correspondence errors. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we apply the proposed method to several state-of-the-art local features and confirm that it improves the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kotaro Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their high versatility in tasks such as image captioning, document analysis, and automated content generation, multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention across various industrial fields. In particular, they have been shown to surpass specialized models in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Nevertheless, their performance under different image conditions remains insufficiently investigated, and individual character recognition is not guaranteed due to their reliance on contextual cues. In this work, we examine a context-independent OCR task using single-character images with diverse visual complexities to determine the conditions for accurate recognition. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs can match conventional OCR methods at about 300 ppi, yet their performance deteriorates significantly below 150 ppi. Additionally, we observe a very weak correlation between visual complexity and misrecognitions, whereas a conventional OCR-specific model exhibits no correlation. These results suggest that image resolution and visual complexity may play an important role in the reliable application of multimodal LLMs to OCR tasks that require precise character-level accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takeshi Noda, Chao Chen, Junsheng Zhou, Weiqi Zhang, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring signed distance functions (SDFs) from sparse point clouds remains a challenge in surface reconstruction. The key lies in the lack of detailed geometric information in sparse point clouds, which is essential for learning a continuous field. To resolve this issue, we present a novel approach that learns a dynamic deformation network to predict SDFs in an end-to-end manner. To parameterize a continuous surface from sparse points, we propose a bijective surface parameterization (BSP) that learns the global shape from local patches. Specifically, we construct a bijective mapping for sparse points from the parametric domain to 3D local patches, integrating patches into the global surface. Meanwhile, we introduce grid deformation optimization (GDO) into the surface approximation to optimize the deformation of grid points and further refine the parametric surfaces. Experimental results on synthetic and real scanned datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkai Tian, Guorong Li, Yuankai Qi, Amin Beheshti, Javen Qinfeng Shi, Anton van den Hengel, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning requires that a model generate high-quality captions without human-annotated video-text pairs for training. State-of-the-art approaches to the problem leverage CLIP to extract visual-relevant textual prompts to guide language models in generating captions. These methods tend to focus on one key aspect of the scene and build a caption that ignores the rest of the visual input. To address this issue, and generate more accurate and complete captions, we propose a novel progressive multi-granularity textual prompting strategy for zero-shot video captioning. Our approach constructs three distinct memory banks, encompassing noun phrases, scene graphs of noun phrases, and entire sentences. Moreover, we introduce a category-aware retrieval mechanism that models the distribution of natural language surrounding the specific topics in question. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with 5.7%, 16.2%, and 3.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX benchmarks compared to existing state-of-the-art.</p>

To address these issues, we propose a detail-aware multi-view stereo network (DA-MVSNet) with a coarse-to-fine framework. The geometric depth clues hidden in the coarse stage are utilized to maintain the geometric structural relationships between object surfaces and enhance the expressive capability of image features. In addition, an image synthesis loss is employed to constrain the gradient flow for detailed regions and further strengthen the supervision of object boundaries and texture-rich areas. Finally, we propose an adaptive depth interval adjustment strategy to improve the accuracy of object reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results. The code is available at https://github.com/wsmtht520-/DAMVSNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D intraoral scan mesh is widely used in digital dentistry diagnosis, segmenting 3D intraoral scan mesh is a critical preliminary task. Numerous approaches have been devised for precise tooth segmentation. Currently, the deep learning-based methods are capable of the high accuracy segmentation of crown. However, the segmentation accuracy at the junction between the crown and the gum is still below average. Existing down-sampling methods are unable to effectively preserve the geometric details at the junction. To address these problems, we propose CrossTooth, a boundary-preserving segmentation method that combines 3D mesh selective downsampling to retain more vertices at the tooth-gingiva area, along with cross-modal discriminative boundary features extracted from multi-view rendered images, enhancing the geometric representation of the segmentation network. Using a point network as a backbone and incorporating image complementary features, CrossTooth significantly improves segmentation accuracy, as demonstrated by experiments on a public intraoral scan dataset.</p>

Due to the binarization of weights and activations, the possible values of each entry in the feature maps generated by BNNs are strongly constrained. To tackle this limitation, we propose the expanding-and-shrinking operation, which enhances binary feature maps with negligible increase of computation complexity, thereby strengthening the representation capacity. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks reveal that our approach generalizes well across diverse applications ranging from image classification, object detection to generative diffusion model, while also achieving remarkable improvement over various leading binarization algorithms based on different architectures including both CNNs and Transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to train a target model without source data, and the key is to generate pseudo-labels using a pre-trained source model. However, we observe that the source model often produces highly uncertain pseudo-labels for hard samples, particularly those heavily affected by domain shifts, leading to these noisy pseudo-labels being introduced even before adaptation and further reinforced through parameter updates. Additionally, they continuously influence neighbor samples through propagation in the feature space.To eliminate the issue of noise accumulation, we propose a novel Progressive Curriculum Labeling (ElimPCL) method, which iteratively filters trustworthy pseudo-labeled samples based on prototype consistency to exclude high-noise samples from training. Furthermore, a Dual MixUP technique is designed in the feature space to enhance the separability of hard samples, thereby mitigating the interference of noisy samples on their neighbors.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ElimPCL, achieving up to a 3.4% improvement on challenging tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made tremendous progress in generating complicated scenes based on texts. However, human-object interaction (HOI) often cannot be precisely generated by current T2V models due to the lack of large-scale videos with accurate captions for HOI. To address this issue, we introduce HOIGen-1M, the first largescale dataset for HOI Generation, consisting of over one million high-quality videos collected from diverse sources. In particular, to guarantee the high quality of videos, we first design an efficient framework to automatically curate HOI videos using the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and then the videos are further cleaned by human annotators. Moreover, to obtain accurate textual captions for HOI videos, we design a novel video description method based on a Mixture-of-Multimodal-Experts (MoME) strategy that not only generates expressive captions but also eliminates the hallucination by individual MLLM. Furthermore, due to the lack of an evaluation framework for generated HOI videos, we propose two new metrics to assess the quality of generated videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments reveal that current T2V models struggle to generate high-quality HOI videos and confirm that our HOIGen-1M dataset is instrumental for improving HOI video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Wengen Li, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou, Yichao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud removal (CR) remains a challenging task in remote sensing image processing. Although diffusion models (DM) exhibit strong generative capabilities, their direct applications to CR are suboptimal, as they generate cloudless images from random noise, ignoring inherent information in cloudy inputs. To overcome this drawback, we develop a new CR model EMRDM based on mean-reverting diffusion models (MRDMs) to establish a direct diffusion process between cloudy and cloudless images. Compared to current MRDMs, EMRDM offers a modular framework with updatable modules and an elucidated design space, based on a reformulated forward process and a new ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based backward process. Leveraging our framework, we redesign key MRDM modules to boost CR performance, including restructuring the denoiser via a preconditioning technique, reorganizing the training process, and improving the sampling process by introducing deterministic and stochastic samplers. To achieve multi-temporal CR, we further develop a denoising network for simultaneously denoising sequential images. Experiments on mono-temporal and multi-temporal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EMRDM. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ly403/EMRDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Hu, Yuhao Wang, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial-Ground person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across heterogeneous cameras in different views. Previous methods usually adopt large-scale models, focusing on view-invariant features. However, they overlook the semantic information in person attributes. Additionally, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. More specifically, we first introduce the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as the backbone, and propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract global semantic features and attribute-aware features. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to generate person attribute predictions and obtain the encoded representations of predicted attributes. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute tokens and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve the AG-ReID. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LATex. The source code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Ren, Xiaopeng Lin, Hongxiang Huang, Yue Zhou, Bojun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye-tracking is a vital technology for human-computer interaction, especially in wearable devices such as AR, VR, and XR. The realization of high-speed and high-precision eye-tracking using frame-based image sensors is constrained by their limited temporal resolution, which impairs the accurate capture of rapid ocular dynamics, such as saccades and blinks. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision systems, are capable of perceiving eye movements with extremely low power consumption and ultra-high temporal resolution. This makes them a promising solution for achieving high-speed, high-precision tracking with rich temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TDTracker, an effective eye-tracking framework that captures rapid eye movements by thoroughly modeling temporal dynamics from both implicit and explicit perspectives. TDTracker utilizes 3D convolutional neural networks to capture implicit short-term temporal dynamics and employs a cascaded structure consisting of a Frequency-aware Module, GRU, and Mamba to extract explicit long-term temporal dynamics. Ultimately, a prediction heatmap is used for eye coordinate regression. Experimental results demonstrate that TDTracker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the synthetic SEET dataset and secured Third place in the CVPR event-based eye-tracking challenge 2025.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonshik Kim, Jaeyoon Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a variety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs. Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance. The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In addition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we also experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading criteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinq-Rong Chern, Yuhao Lee, Hsiao-Ching Lin, Guan-Ting Chen, Ying-Hsien Chen, Fu-Sung Lin, Chih-Yao Chuang, Jenn-Jier James Lien, Chih-Hsien Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Research has revealed that strength training can reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and physical deterioration at any age. Therefore, having a movement diagnostic system is crucial for training alone. Hence, this study developed an artificial intelligence and computer vision-based barbell squat coaching system with a real-time mode that immediately diagnoses the issue and provides feedback after each squat. In addition, a replay mode allows users to examine their previous squats and check their comments. Initially, four primary characteristics of the barbell squat were identified: body joint angles, dorsiflexion, the ratio of knee-to-hip movement, and barbell stability. Methods: We collect 8,151 squats from 77 participants, categorizing them as good squats and six issues. Then, we trained the diagnosis models with three machine-learning architectures. Furthermore, this research applied the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the accuracy of issue prediction and reduce the computation time by feature selection. Results: The F1 score of the six issues reached 86.86%, 69.01%, 77.42%, 90.74%, 95.83%, and 100%. Each squat diagnosis took less than 0.5 seconds. Finally, this study examined the efficacy of the proposed system with two groups of participants trained with and without the system. Subsequently, participants trained with the system exhibited substantial improvements in their squat technique, as assessed both by the system itself and by a professional weightlifting coach. Conclusion: This is a comprehensive study that integrates artificial intelligence, computer vision and multivariable processing technologies, aimed at building a real-time, user-friendly barbell squat feedback and training system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Liu, Yaxiong Wang, Li Zhu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a training-free framework specifically designed to bring real-world static paintings to life through image-to-video (I2V) synthesis, addressing the persistent challenge of aligning these motions with textual guidance while preserving fidelity to the original artworks. Existing I2V methods, primarily trained on natural video datasets, often struggle to generate dynamic outputs from static paintings. It remains challenging to generate motion while maintaining visual consistency with real-world paintings. This results in two distinct failure modes: either static outputs due to limited text-based motion interpretation or distorted dynamics caused by inadequate alignment with real-world artistic styles. We leverage the advanced text-image alignment capabilities of pre-trained image models to guide the animation process. Our approach introduces synthetic proxy images through two key innovations: (1) Dual-path score distillation: We employ a dual-path architecture to distill motion priors from both real and synthetic data, preserving static details from the original painting while learning dynamic characteristics from synthetic frames. (2) Hybrid latent fusion: We integrate hybrid features extracted from real paintings and synthetic proxy images via spherical linear interpolation in the latent space, ensuring smooth transitions and enhancing temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach significantly improves semantic alignment with text prompts while faithfully preserving the unique characteristics and integrity of the original paintings. Crucially, by achieving enhanced dynamic effects without requiring any model training or learnable parameters, our framework enables plug-and-play integration with existing I2V methods, making it an ideal solution for animating real-world paintings. More animated examples can be found on our project website.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dizhan Xue, Jing Cui, Shengsheng Qian, Chuanrui Hu, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zhou, Peng Ye, Haoyu Zhang, Jiakang Yuan, Rao Qiang, Liu YangChenXu, Wu Cailin, Feng Xu, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative-based methods have become mainstream in stereo matching due to their high performance. However, these methods heavily rely on labeled data and face challenges with unlabeled real-world data. To this end, we propose a consistency-aware self-training framework for iterative-based stereo matching for the first time, leveraging real-world unlabeled data in a teacher-student manner. We first observe that regions with larger errors tend to exhibit more pronounced oscillation characteristics during model prediction.Based on this, we introduce a novel consistency-aware soft filtering module to evaluate the reliability of teacher-predicted pseudo-labels, which consists of a multi-resolution prediction consistency filter and an iterative prediction consistency filter to assess the prediction fluctuations of multiple resolutions and iterative optimization respectively. Further, we introduce a consistency-aware soft-weighted loss to adjust the weight of pseudo-labels accordingly, relieving the error accumulation and performance degradation problem due to incorrect pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of various iterative-based stereo matching approaches in various scenarios. In particular, our method can achieve further enhancements over the current SOTA methods on several benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhou, Dian Zheng, Qijie Mo, Renjie Lu, Kun-Yu Lin, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present DEcoupLEd Distillation To Erase (DELETE), a general and strong unlearning method for any class-centric tasks. To derive this, we first propose a theoretical framework to analyze the general form of unlearning loss and decompose it into forgetting and retention terms. Through the theoretical framework, we point out that a class of previous methods could be mainly formulated as a loss that implicitly optimizes the forgetting term while lacking supervision for the retention term, disturbing the distribution of pre-trained model and struggling to adequately preserve knowledge of the remaining classes. To address it, we refine the retention term using "dark knowledge" and propose a mask distillation unlearning method. By applying a mask to separate forgetting logits from retention logits, our approach optimizes both the forgetting and refined retention components simultaneously, retaining knowledge of the remaining classes while ensuring thorough forgetting of the target class. Without access to the remaining data or intervention (i.e., used in some works), we achieve state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. What's more, DELETE is a general solution that can be applied to various downstream tasks, including face recognition, backdoor defense, and semantic segmentation with great performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced medical image analysis by effectively modeling long-range dependencies, yet they often struggle in 3D settings due to substantial memory overhead and insufficient capture of fine-grained local features. We address these limitations with WaveFormer, a novel 3D-transformer that: i) leverages the fundamental frequency-domain properties of features for contextual representation, and ii) is inspired by the top-down mechanism of the human visual recognition system, making it a biologically motivated architecture. By employing discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) at multiple scales, WaveFormer preserves both global context and high-frequency details while replacing heavy upsampling layers with efficient wavelet-based summarization and reconstruction. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for real-world deployment where computational resources and training times are constrained. Furthermore, the model is generic and easily adaptable to diverse applications. Evaluations on BraTS2023, FLARE2021, and KiTS2023 demonstrate performance on par with state-of-the-art methods while offering substantially lower computational complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxiang Wang, Hongzhen Wang, Mingshuo Chen, Di Wang, Yulin Wang, Zonghao Guo, Qiang Ma, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Jing Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The astonishing breakthrough of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has necessitated new benchmarks to quantitatively assess their capabilities, reveal their limitations, and indicate future research directions. However, this is challenging in the context of remote sensing (RS), since the imagery features ultra-high resolution that incorporates extremely complex semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks usually adopt notably smaller image sizes than real-world RS scenarios, suffer from limited annotation quality, and consider insufficient dimensions of evaluation. To address these issues, we present XLRS-Bench: a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in ultra-high-resolution RS scenarios. XLRS-Bench boasts the largest average image size (8500$\times$8500) observed thus far, with all evaluation samples meticulously annotated manually, assisted by a novel semi-automatic captioner on ultra-high-resolution RS images. On top of the XLRS-Bench, 16 sub-tasks are defined to evaluate MLLMs' 10 kinds of perceptual capabilities and 6 kinds of reasoning capabilities, with a primary emphasis on advanced cognitive processes that facilitate real-world decision-making and the capture of spatiotemporal changes. The results of both general and RS-focused MLLMs on XLRS-Bench indicate that further efforts are needed for real-world RS applications. We have open-sourced XLRS-Bench to support further research in developing more powerful MLLMs for remote sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Heublein, Nisha L. Raichur, Tobias Feigl, Tobias Brieger, Fin Heuer, Lennart Asbach, Alexander R\"ugamer, Felix Ott</p>
<p>Abstract: The accuracy and reliability of vehicle localization on roads are crucial for applications such as self-driving cars, toll systems, and digital tachographs. To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions. However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals, necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area. Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria, and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes in the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Shen, Peixian Zhuang, Jiahao Kou, Yuxin Zeng, Haoying Xu, Jiangyun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAMs), as vision foundation models, have demonstrated remarkable performance across various image analysis tasks. Despite their strong generalization capabilities, SAMs encounter challenges in fine-grained detail segmentation for high-resolution class-independent segmentation (HRCS), due to the limitations in the direct processing of high-resolution inputs and low-resolution mask predictions, and the reliance on accurate manual prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2 which integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global image and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates the pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter (MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the Hierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement Module (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2 encoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS images. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and global context by aggregating multi-view features within and across multi-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored high-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained details resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong generalization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution datasets.

<p>Abstract: Recently, deep learning-based pan-sharpening algorithms have achieved notable advancements over traditional methods. However, many deep learning-based approaches incur substantial computational overhead during inference, especially with high-resolution images. This excessive computational demand limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, particularly in the absence of dedicated computing devices such as GPUs and TPUs. To address these challenges, we propose Pan-LUT, a novel learnable look-up table (LUT) framework for pan-sharpening that strikes a balance between performance and computational efficiency for high-resolution remote sensing images. To finely control the spectral transformation, we devise the PAN-guided look-up table (PGLUT) for channel-wise spectral mapping. To effectively capture fine-grained spatial details and adaptively learn local contexts, we introduce the spatial details look-up table (SDLUT) and adaptive aggregation look-up table (AALUT). Our proposed method contains fewer than 300K parameters and processes a 8K resolution image in under 1 ms using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, demonstrating significantly faster performance compared to other methods. Experiments reveal that Pan-LUT efficiently processes large remote sensing images in a lightweight manner, bridging the gap to real-world applications. Furthermore, our model surpasses SOTA methods in full-resolution scenes under real-world conditions, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present On-device Sora, the first model training-free solution for diffusion-based on-device text-to-video generation that operates efficiently on smartphone-grade devices. To address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices, the proposed On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to pre-trained video generative models. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive token-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens along the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them into memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the challenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations show that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation on commodity mobile and embedded devices without resource-intensive re-training for model optimization (compression).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqing Guo, Wuyang Li, Yixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3) aims to achieve the human-level capability of segmenting not only seen classes but also novel class regions unseen in the training data through introducing the bridge of semantic representations, e.g., word vector. While effective, the way of utilizing one semantic representation to associate the corresponding class and to enable the knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes is insufficient as well as incompatible with human cognition. Inspired by the observation that humans often use some `part' and `state' information to comprehend the seen objects and imagine unseen classes, we decouple each class into detailed descriptions, including object parts and states. Based on the decoupling formulation, we propose a Decoupled Vision-Language Matching (DeVLMatch) framework, composed of spatial-part (SPMatch) and channel-state (CSMatch) matching modules, for GZS3. In SPMatch, we comprehend objects with spatial part information from both visual and linguistic perspectives and perform graph matching to bridge the gap. In CSMatch, states of objects from the linguistic perspective are matched to compatible channel information from the visual perspective. By decoupling and matching objects across visual and linguistic comprehension, we can explicitly introspect the relationship between seen and unseen classes in fine-grained object part and state levels, thereby facilitating the knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes in visual space. The proposed DeVLMatch framework surpasses the previous GZS3 methods on standard benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC, COCO-Stuff, and CATARACTS, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Li, Chenyu Li, Pedram Ghamisi, Danfeng Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of multi-source satellite imagery drives innovation in Earth observation, opening unprecedented opportunities for Remote Sensing Foundation Models to harness diverse data. However, many existing models remain constrained by fixed spatial resolutions and patch sizes, limiting their ability to fully exploit the heterogeneous spatial characteristics inherent in satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose FlexiMo, a flexible remote sensing foundation model that endows the pre-trained model with the flexibility to adapt to arbitrary spatial resolutions. Central to FlexiMo is a spatial resolution-aware module that employs a parameter-free alignment embedding mechanism to dynamically recalibrate patch embeddings based on the input image's resolution and dimensions. This design not only preserves critical token characteristics and ensures multi-scale feature fidelity but also enables efficient feature extraction without requiring modifications to the underlying network architecture. In addition, FlexiMo incorporates a lightweight channel adaptation module that leverages prior spectral information from sensors. This mechanism allows the model to process images with varying numbers of channels while maintaining the data's intrinsic physical properties. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-scale datasets demonstrate that FlexiMo significantly enhances model generalization and robustness. In particular, our method achieves outstanding performance across a range of downstream tasks, including scene classification, land cover classification, urban building segmentation, and cloud detection. By enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent adaptation, FlexiMo paves the way for more adaptable and effective foundation models in real-world remote sensing applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital pathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnostics, but their ultra-high resolution and large file sizes pose significant challenges for storage, transmission, and real-time visualization. To address these issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details. Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more structured latent representations. These components are processed through parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability. The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC) models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Gong, Boyan Li, Yifei Zhong, Fangxin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for augmented and virtual reality applications has highlighted the importance of crafting immersive 3D scenes from a simple single-view image. However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Halil \.Ibrahim \"Ozt\"urk, Muhammet Esat Kalfao\u{g}lu, Ozsel Kilinc</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient lane detection in 3D space is essential for autonomous driving systems, where robust generalization is the foremost requirement for 3D lane detection algorithms. Considering the extensive variation in lane structures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly challenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane patterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning lane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes exhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization limitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and subsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete 3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we predict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict the same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate overlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph and minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on both the Apollo and OpenLane datasets, demonstrating superior F1 scores and a strong generalization capacity when models trained on OpenLane are evaluated on the Apollo dataset, compared to prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Siting Huang, Xiangyang Luo, Yifan Xie, Weijiang Yu, Heng Chang, Fei Ma, Fei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Face editing modifies the appearance of face, which plays a key role in customization and enhancement of personal images. Although much work have achieved remarkable success in text-driven face editing, they still face significant challenges as none of them simultaneously fulfill the characteristics of diversity, controllability and flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose MuseFace, a text-driven face editing framework, which relies solely on text prompt to enable face editing. Specifically, MuseFace integrates a Text-to-Mask diffusion model and a semantic-aware face editing model, capable of directly generating fine-grained semantic masks from text and performing face editing. The Text-to-Mask diffusion model provides \textit{diversity} and \textit{flexibility} to the framework, while the semantic-aware face editing model ensures \textit{controllability} of the framework. Our framework can create fine-grained semantic masks, making precise face editing possible, and significantly enhancing the controllability and flexibility of face editing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseFace achieves superior high-fidelity performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Wang, Lanqing Guo, Zhihao Li, Jiaxing Huang, Pichao Wang, Bihan Wen, Jian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. The code will be released.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23905">Boosting MLLM Reasoning with Text-Debiased Hint-GRPO</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Huang, Long Chan, Jinlong Liu, Wanggui He, Hao Jiang, Mingli Song, Jingyuan Chen, Chang Yao, Jie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent problem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises the final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view that PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance using an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still struggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the performance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data utilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the MLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses image condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO training. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves data utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying difficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating the token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment results on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large margin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Liao, Xiaokun Liu, Wenyu Qin, Qingyu Li, Qiulin Wang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Long Zeng, Pingfa Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) is a long-standing and challenging research task. However, its subset, Human Image Aesthetic Assessment (HIAA), has been scarcely explored, even though HIAA is widely used in social media, AI workflows, and related domains. To bridge this research gap, our work pioneers a holistic implementation framework tailored for HIAA. Specifically, we introduce HumanBeauty, the first dataset purpose-built for HIAA, which comprises 108k high-quality human images with manual annotations. To achieve comprehensive and fine-grained HIAA, 50K human images are manually collected through a rigorous curation process and annotated leveraging our trailblazing 12-dimensional aesthetic standard, while the remaining 58K with overall aesthetic labels are systematically filtered from public datasets. Based on the HumanBeauty database, we propose HumanAesExpert, a powerful Vision Language Model for aesthetic evaluation of human images. We innovatively design an Expert head to incorporate human knowledge of aesthetic sub-dimensions while jointly utilizing the Language Modeling (LM) and Regression head. This approach empowers our model to achieve superior proficiency in both overall and fine-grained HIAA. Furthermore, we introduce a MetaVoter, which aggregates scores from all three heads, to effectively balance the capabilities of each head, thereby realizing improved assessment precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HumanAesExpert models deliver significantly better performance in HIAA than other state-of-the-art models. Our datasets, models, and codes are publicly released to advance the HIAA community. Project webpage: https://humanaesexpert.github.io/HumanAesExpert/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruisheng Han, Kanglei Zhou, Amir Atapour-Abarghouei, Xiaohui Liang, Hubert P. H. Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: Action quality assessment (AQA) is critical for evaluating athletic performance, informing training strategies, and ensuring safety in competitive sports. However, existing deep learning approaches often operate as black boxes and are vulnerable to spurious correlations, limiting both their reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce FineCausal, a novel causal-based framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineDiving-HM dataset. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network-based causal intervention module to disentangle human-centric foreground cues from background confounders, and incorporates a temporal causal attention module to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies across action stages. This dual-module strategy enables FineCausal to generate detailed spatio-temporal representations that not only achieve state-of-the-art scoring performance but also provide transparent, interpretable feedback on which features drive the assessment. Despite its strong performance, FineCausal requires extensive expert knowledge to define causal structures and depends on high-quality annotations, challenges that we discuss and address as future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhuo Li, Yifan Lu, Linfeng Tang, Shihua Zhang, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: This prospective study proposes CoMatch, a novel semi-dense image matcher with dynamic covisibility awareness and bilateral subpixel accuracy. Firstly, observing that modeling context interaction over the entire coarse feature map elicits highly redundant computation due to the neighboring representation similarity of tokens, a covisibility-guided token condenser is introduced to adaptively aggregate tokens in light of their covisibility scores that are dynamically estimated, thereby ensuring computational efficiency while improving the representational capacity of aggregated tokens simultaneously. Secondly, considering that feature interaction with massive non-covisible areas is distracting, which may degrade feature distinctiveness, a covisibility-assisted attention mechanism is deployed to selectively suppress irrelevant message broadcast from non-covisible reduced tokens, resulting in robust and compact attention to relevant rather than all ones. Thirdly, we find that at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's keypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted at the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint location-sensitive usages. A simple yet potent fine correlation module is developed to refine the matching candidates in both source and target views to subpixel level, attaining attractive performance improvement. Thorough experimentation across an array of public benchmarks affirms CoMatch's promising accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) Sensors, widely deployed in smartwatches, offer a simple and non-invasive authentication approach for daily use. However, PPG authentication faces reliability issues due to motion artifacts from physical activity and physiological variability over time. To address these challenges, we propose MTL-RAPID, an efficient and reliable PPG authentication model, that employs a multitask joint training strategy, simultaneously assessing signal quality and verifying user identity. The joint optimization of these two tasks in MTL-RAPID results in a structure that outperforms models trained on individual tasks separately, achieving stronger performance with fewer parameters. In our comprehensive user studies regarding motion artifacts (N = 30), time variations (N = 32), and user preferences (N = 16), MTL-RAPID achieves a best AUC of 99.2\% and an EER of 3.5\%, outperforming existing baselines. We opensource our PPG authentication dataset along with the MTL-RAPID model to facilitate future research on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guhnoo Yun, Juhan Yoo, Kijung Kim, Jeongho Lee, Paul Hongsuck Seo, Dong Hwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that 2D convolution and self-attention exhibit distinct spectral behaviors, and optimizing their spectral properties can enhance vision model performance. However, theoretical analyses remain limited in explaining why 2D convolution is more effective in high-pass filtering than self-attention and why larger kernels favor shape bias, akin to self-attention. In this paper, we employ graph spectral analysis to theoretically simulate and compare the frequency responses of 2D convolution and self-attention within a unified framework. Our results corroborate previous empirical findings and reveal that node connectivity, modulated by window size, is a key factor in shaping spectral functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a \textit{spectral-adaptive modulation} (SPAM) mixer, which processes visual features in a spectral-adaptive manner using multi-scale convolutional kernels and a spectral re-scaling mechanism to refine spectral components. Based on SPAM, we develop SPANetV2 as a novel vision backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPANetV2 outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple vision tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangda Chen, Shanshan Zhao, Chuanfu Xu, Long Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video advancements have enabled coherent video synthesis from prompts and expanded to fine-grained control over appearance and motion. However, existing methods either suffer from concept interference due to feature domain mismatch caused by naive decoupled optimizations or exhibit appearance contamination induced by spatial feature leakage resulting from the entanglement of motion and appearance in reference video reconstructions. In this paper, we propose JointTuner, a novel adaptive joint training framework, to alleviate these issues. Specifically, we develop Adaptive LoRA, which incorporates a context-aware gating mechanism, and integrate the gated LoRA components into the spatial and temporal Transformers within the diffusion model. These components enable simultaneous optimization of appearance and motion, eliminating concept interference. In addition, we introduce the Appearance-independent Temporal Loss, which decouples motion patterns from intrinsic appearance in reference video reconstructions through an appearance-agnostic noise prediction task. The key innovation lies in adding frame-wise offset noise to the ground-truth Gaussian noise, perturbing its distribution, thereby disrupting spatial attributes associated with frames while preserving temporal coherence. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark comprising 90 appearance-motion customized combinations and 10 multi-type automatic metrics across four dimensions, facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation for this customization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to current advanced approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. Analyzing histological images of melanoma by localizing and classifying tissues and cell nuclei is considered the gold standard method for diagnosis and treatment options for patients. While many computerized approaches have been proposed for automatic analysis, most perform tissue-based analysis and nuclei (cell)-based analysis as separate tasks, which might be suboptimal.
  In this work, using the PUMA challenge dataset, we proposed a novel multi-stage deep learning approach by combining tissue and nuclei information in a unified framework based on the auto-context concept to perform segmentation and classification in histological images of melanoma. Through pre-training and further post-processing, our approach achieved second and first place rankings in the PUMA challenge, with average micro Dice tissue score and summed nuclei F1-score of 73.40% for Track 1 and 63.48% for Track 2, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bizhe Bai, Jianjian Cao, Yadan Luo, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) is an emerging vision-language task that requires models to generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. Recent models, such as GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA, achieve pixel-level grounding but incur significant computational costs due to processing a large number of visual tokens. Existing token pruning methods, like FastV and PyramidDrop, fail to preserve the local visual features critical for accurate grounding, leading to substantial performance drops in GCG tasks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Local-Aware Token Pruning (ALTP), a simple yet effective framework that accelerates GCG models by prioritizing local object information. ALTP introduces two key components: (1) Detail Density Capture (DDC), which uses superpixel segmentation to retain tokens in object-centric regions, preserving fine-grained details, and (2) Dynamic Density Formation (DDF), which dynamically allocates tokens based on information density, ensuring higher retention in semantically rich areas. Extensive experiments on the GranDf dataset demonstrate that ALTP significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods, such as FastV and PyramidDrop, on both GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA models. Notably, when applied to GLaMM, ALTP achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens with a 4.9% improvement in AP50 and a 5.0% improvement in Recall compared to PyramidDrop. Similarly, on OMG-LLaVA, ALTP improves AP by 2.1% and mIOU by 3.0% at a 90% token reduction compared with PDrop.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving faces safety challenges due to a lack of global perspective and the semantic information of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps. Information from roadside cameras can greatly expand the map perception range through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, there is still no dataset from the real world available for the study on map vectorization onboard under the scenario of vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. To prosper the research on online HD mapping for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving (VICAD), we release a real-world dataset, which contains collaborative camera frames from both vehicles and roadside infrastructures, and provides human annotations of HD map elements. We also present an end-to-end neural framework (i.e., V2I-HD) leveraging vision-centric V2I systems to construct vectorized maps. To reduce computation costs and further deploy V2I-HD on autonomous vehicles, we introduce a directionally decoupled self-attention mechanism to V2I-HD. Extensive experiments show that V2I-HD has superior performance in real-time inference speed, as tested by our real-world dataset. Abundant qualitative results also demonstrate stable and robust map construction quality with low cost in complex and various driving scenes.

The architecture leverages a transformer-like design with convolutional self-attention modules, which is optimized specifically for deployment on the Rockchip RV1126 embedded platform. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{ViTLR} achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time processing capabilities (>25 FPS) on RV1126's NPU. The system shows superior robustness across temporal stability, varying target distances, and challenging environmental conditions compared to existing single-frame approaches. We have successfully integrated \textit{ViTLR} into an ego-lane traffic light recognition system using HD maps for autonomous driving applications. The complete implementation, including source code and datasets, is made publicly available to facilitate further research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Yongtao Chen, Chuan Cao, Tianchen Deng, Wentao Zhao, Jingchuan Wang, Weidong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool (SALT) for general LiDAR point clouds with cross-scene adaptability and 4D consistency. Unlike recent approaches that rely on camera distillation, SALT operates directly on raw LiDAR data, automatically generating pre-segmentation results. To achieve this, we propose a novel zero-shot learning paradigm, termed data alignment, which transforms LiDAR data into pseudo-images by aligning with the training distribution of vision foundation models. Additionally, we design a 4D-consistent prompting strategy and 4D non-maximum suppression module to enhance SAM2, ensuring high-quality, temporally consistent presegmentation. SALT surpasses the latest zero-shot methods by 18.4% PQ on SemanticKITTI and achieves nearly 40-50% of human annotator performance on our newly collected low-resolution LiDAR data and on combined data from three LiDAR types, significantly boosting annotation efficiency. We anticipate that SALT's open-sourcing will catalyze substantial expansion of current LiDAR datasets and lay the groundwork for the future development of LiDAR foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Yuan, Sichao Wang, Chuang Zhang, Lei He, Qing Xu, Jianqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The depth completion task is a critical problem in autonomous driving, involving the generation of dense depth maps from sparse depth maps and RGB images. Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wu, Quanlong Zheng, Yanhao Zhang, Junlin Xie, Jinguo Luo, Kuo Wang, Peng Liu, Qingsong Xie, Ru Zhen, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal models, the demand for assessing video understanding capabilities has been steadily increasing. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant limitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video understanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both general video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark contributes three key features:
  Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to comprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in current benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional perceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for countercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions test the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge. Enriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI agents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion allows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding streaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess substantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks. We expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding research by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh David Thao Chan, Ruoyu Zhao, Yukuan Jia, Ruiqing Mao, Sheng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The energy consumption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical factor in deploying deep learning models on resource-limited equipment such as mobile devices and autonomous vehicles. We propose an approach involving Proportional Layer Skipping (PLS) and Frequency Scaling (FS). Layer skipping reduces computational complexity by selectively bypassing network layers, whereas frequency scaling adjusts the frequency of the processor to optimize energy use under latency constraints. Experiments of PLS and FS on ResNet-152 with the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrated significant reductions in computational demands and energy consumption with minimal accuracy loss. This study offers practical solutions for improving real-time processing in resource-limited settings and provides insights into balancing computational efficiency and model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenqi Guo, Mengshuo Rong, Qianli Feng, Rongfan Feng, Yinglong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) aims to enhance a unimodal student using a multimodal teacher model. In particular, when the teacher's modalities include the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to improve knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets typically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a natural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these labels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and can lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD framework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed text embeddings under a hierarchical loss. By avoiding direct use of exact class names and instead using semantically richer WordNet expansions, we mitigate label leakage and introduce more diverse textual cues. Experiments show that this strategy significantly boosts student performance, whereas noisy or overly precise text embeddings hinder distillation efficiency. Interpretability analyses confirm that WordNet-relaxed prompts encourage heavier reliance on visual features over textual shortcuts, while still effectively incorporating the newly introduced textual cues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best results on six public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing crossmodal KD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyuan Wang, Xiaofeng Wang, Chaojun Ni, Guosheng Zhao, Zhiqin Yang, Zheng Zhu, Muyang Zhang, Yukun Zhou, Xinze Chen, Guan Huang, Lihong Liu, Xingang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-motion video generation has been a challenging task, primarily due to the difficulty inherent in learning human body movements. While some approaches have attempted to drive human-centric video generation explicitly through pose control, these methods typically rely on poses derived from existing videos, thereby lacking flexibility. To address this, we propose HumanDreamer, a decoupled human video generation framework that first generates diverse poses from text prompts and then leverages these poses to generate human-motion videos. Specifically, we propose MotionVid, the largest dataset for human-motion pose generation. Based on the dataset, we present MotionDiT, which is trained to generate structured human-motion poses from text prompts. Besides, a novel LAMA loss is introduced, which together contribute to a significant improvement in FID by 62.4%, along with respective enhancements in R-precision for top1, top2, and top3 by 41.8%, 26.3%, and 18.3%, thereby advancing both the Text-to-Pose control accuracy and FID metrics. Our experiments across various Pose-to-Video baselines demonstrate that the poses generated by our method can produce diverse and high-quality human-motion videos. Furthermore, our model can facilitate other downstream tasks, such as pose sequence prediction and 2D-3D motion lifting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasashwini Sai Gowri P, Karthik Seemakurthy, Andrews Agyemang Opoku, Sita Devi Bharatula</p>
<p>Abstract: Wheat plays a critical role in global food security, making it one of the most extensively studied crops. Accurate identification and measurement of key characteristics of wheat heads are essential for breeders to select varieties for cross-breeding, with the goal of developing nutrient-dense, resilient, and sustainable cultivars. Traditionally, these measurements are performed manually, which is both time-consuming and inefficient. Advances in digital technologies have paved the way for automating this process. However, field conditions pose significant challenges, such as occlusions of leaves, overlapping wheat heads, varying lighting conditions, and motion blur. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique, BBoxCut, which uses random localized masking to simulate occlusions caused by leaves and neighboring wheat heads. We evaluated our approach using three state-of-the-art object detectors and observed mean average precision (mAP) gains of 2.76, 3.26, and 1.9 for Faster R-CNN, FCOS, and DETR, respectively. Our augmentation technique led to significant improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, the improvements were particularly evident in scenarios involving occluded wheat heads, demonstrating the robustness of our method in challenging field conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Micro-expressions are typically regarded as unconscious manifestations of a person's genuine emotions. However, their short duration and subtle signals pose significant challenges for downstream recognition. We propose a multi-task learning framework named the Adaptive Motion Magnification and Sparse Mamba (AMMSM) to address this. This framework aims to enhance the accurate capture of micro-expressions through self-supervised subtle motion magnification, while the sparse spatial selection Mamba architecture combines sparse activation with the advanced Visual Mamba model to model key motion regions and their valuable representations more effectively. Additionally, we employ evolutionary search to optimize the magnification factor and the sparsity ratios of spatial selection, followed by fine-tuning to improve performance further. Extensive experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed AMMSM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Zhang, Yanyuan Qiao, Qunbo Wang, Zike Yan, Qi Wu, Zhihua Wei, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have gained prominence within artificial intelligence research due to their potential application in fields like home assistants. Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on transformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components such as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance. These additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and increased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance and low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the COmbination of Selective MemOrization (COSMO). Specifically, COSMO integrates state-space modules and transformer modules, and incorporates two VLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS) and the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates comprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3 module adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture, thereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental validations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not only demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show a significant reduction in computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teresa Dorszewski, Lenka T\v{e}tkov\'a, Robert Jenssen, Lars Kai Hansen, Kristoffer Knutsen Wickstr{\o}m</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly utilized in various computer vision tasks due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, it remains understudied how ViTs process information layer by layer. Numerous studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features of increasing complexity throughout their layers, which is crucial for tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning. ViTs, lacking the same inductive biases as CNNs, can potentially learn global dependencies from the first layers due to their attention mechanisms. Given the increasing importance of ViTs in computer vision, there is a need to improve the layer-wise understanding of ViTs. In this work, we present a novel, layer-wise analysis of concepts encoded in state-of-the-art ViTs using neuron labeling. Our findings reveal that ViTs encode concepts with increasing complexity throughout the network. Early layers primarily encode basic features such as colors and textures, while later layers represent more specific classes, including objects and animals. As the complexity of encoded concepts increases, the number of concepts represented in each layer also rises, reflecting a more diverse and specific set of features. Additionally, different pretraining strategies influence the quantity and category of encoded concepts, with finetuning to specific downstream tasks generally reducing the number of encoded concepts and shifting the concepts to more relevant categories.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24088">A Plasticity-Aware Method for Continual Self-Supervised Learning in Remote Sensing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars M\"ollenbrok, Behnood Rasti, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) methods have gained increasing attention in remote sensing (RS) due to their capability to learn new tasks sequentially from continuous streams of unlabeled data.
  Existing CSSL methods, while learning new tasks, focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting. To this end, most of them use regularization strategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's ability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which can degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high learning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge distillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling is achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and task-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated to ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be de-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a widely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average accuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24% in average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems require accurate and reliable perception. However, adverse environments, such as rain, snow, and fog, can significantly degrade the performance of LiDAR and cameras. In contrast, 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar not only provides 3D sensing and additional velocity measurements but also maintains robustness in challenging conditions, making it increasingly valuable for autonomous driving. Recently, research on 4D mmWave radar under adverse environments has been growing, but a comprehensive survey is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this survey comprehensively reviews the current research on 4D mmWave radar under adverse environments. First, we present an overview of existing 4D mmWave radar datasets encompassing diverse weather and lighting scenarios. Next, we analyze methods and models according to different adverse conditions. Finally, the challenges faced in current studies and potential future directions are discussed for advancing 4D mmWave radar applications in harsh environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focusing on 4D mmWave radar in adverse environments for autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio Description is a narrated commentary designed to aid vision-impaired audiences in perceiving key visual elements in a video. While short-form video understanding has advanced rapidly, a solution for maintaining coherent long-term visual storytelling remains unresolved. Existing methods rely solely on frame-level embeddings, effectively describing object-based content but lacking contextual information across scenes.

DANTE-AD sequentially fuses both frame and scene level embeddings to improve long-term contextual understanding. We propose a novel, state-of-the-art method for sequential cross-attention to achieve contextual grounding for fine-grained audio description generation. Evaluated on a broad range of key scenes from well-known movie clips, DANTE-AD outperforms existing methods across traditional NLP metrics and LLM-based evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early detection, accurate segmentation, classification and tracking of polyps during colonoscopy are critical for preventing colorectal cancer. Many existing deep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require task-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on domain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce \textit{PolypSegTrack}, a novel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp detection, segmentation, classification and unsupervised tracking in colonoscopic videos. Our approach leverages a novel conditional mask loss, enabling flexible training across datasets with either pixel-level segmentation masks or bounding box annotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific fine-tuning. Our unsupervised tracking module reliably associates polyp instances across frames using object queries, without relying on any heuristics. We leverage a robust vision foundation model backbone that is pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images, thereby removing the need for domain-specific pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple polyp benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, classification, and tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image registration is fundamental in medical imaging, enabling precise alignment of anatomical structures for diagnosis, treatment planning, image-guided treatment or longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces IMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality registration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless integration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and Voxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical images without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability across various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale pretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment Anything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach offers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient solutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on five challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in anatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further confirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise, artifacts, and modality variations. IMPACT's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for advancing registration performance in clinical and research applications, addressing critical challenges in multimodal medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Schnaus, Nikita Araslanov, Daniel Cremers</p>
<p>Abstract: The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In particular, pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This suggests that as foundation models mature, it may become possible to match vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without parallel data. We present the first feasibility study, and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised, or "blind", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy without any image-text annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Guichemerre, Soufiane Belharbi, Mohammadhadi Shateri, Luke McCaffrey, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods allow training models to classify images and localize ROIs. WSOL only requires low-cost image-class annotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier, which is important in histology image analysis. Standard WSOL methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according to a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations with histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization cues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between classification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal because it is tied to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with classification. This allows learning discriminant features and accurate delineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localization and image classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/background pixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object localization. PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a pretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneously using standard gradient descent. In addition, our pixel classifier can easily be integrated into CNN- and transformer-based architectures without any modifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Seismic processing plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into high-quality subsurface images, pivotal for various geoscience applications. Despite its importance, traditional seismic processing techniques face challenges such as noisy and damaged data and the reliance on manual, time-consuming workflows. The emergence of deep learning approaches has introduced effective and user-friendly alternatives, yet many of these deep learning approaches rely on synthetic datasets and specialized neural networks. Recently, foundation models have gained traction in the seismic domain, due to their success in natural imaging. This paper investigates the application of foundation models in seismic processing on the tasks: demultiple, interpolation, and denoising. It evaluates the impact of different model characteristics, such as pre-training technique and neural network architecture, on performance and efficiency. Rather than proposing a single seismic foundation model, this paper critically examines various natural image foundation models and suggest some promising candidates for future exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUI) automation agents are emerging as powerful tools, enabling humans to accomplish increasingly complex tasks on smart devices. However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying tasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does not support immediate user intervention.

We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to ask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with ambiguous user tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingrui Ji, Xi Xiao, Gaofei Chen, Hao Xu, Chenrui Ma, Lijing Zhu, Aokun Liang, Jiansheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable success in cross-modal tasks such as zero-shot image classification and text-image retrieval by effectively aligning visual and textual representations. However, the theoretical foundations underlying CLIP's strong generalization remain unclear. In this work, we address this gap by proposing the Cross-modal Information Bottleneck (CIB) framework. CIB offers a principled interpretation of CLIP's contrastive learning objective as an implicit Information Bottleneck optimization. Under this view, the model maximizes shared cross-modal information while discarding modality-specific redundancies, thereby preserving essential semantic alignment across modalities. Building on this insight, we introduce a Cross-modal Information Bottleneck Regularization (CIBR) method that explicitly enforces these IB principles during training. CIBR introduces a penalty term to discourage modality-specific redundancy, thereby enhancing semantic alignment between image and text features. We validate CIBR on extensive vision-language benchmarks, including zero-shot classification across seven diverse image datasets and text-image retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. The results show consistent performance gains over standard CLIP. These findings provide the first theoretical understanding of CLIP's generalization through the IB lens. They also demonstrate practical improvements, offering guidance for future cross-modal representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungjun Lee, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Radouane, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha lebbah</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and visual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional OD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set object detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially supervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform the VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and (ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals, followed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization. Our model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while retaining classical OD capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Otsuka, Shinichi Mae, Ryosuke Yamada, Hirokatsu Kataoka</p>
<p>Abstract: In the recent years, the research community has witnessed growing use of 3D point cloud data for the high applicability in various real-world applications. By means of 3D point cloud, this modality enables to consider the actual size and spatial understanding. The applied fields include mechanical control of robots, vehicles, or other real-world systems. Along this line, we would like to improve 3D point cloud instance segmentation which has emerged as a particularly promising approach for these applications. However, the creation of 3D point cloud datasets entails enormous costs compared to 2D image datasets. To train a model of 3D point cloud instance segmentation, it is necessary not only to assign categories but also to provide detailed annotations for each point in the large-scale 3D space. Meanwhile, the increase of recent proposals for generative models in 3D domain has spurred proposals for using a generative model to create 3D point cloud data. In this work, we propose a pre-training with 3D synthetic data to train a 3D point cloud instance segmentation model based on generative model for 3D scenes represented by point cloud data. We directly generate 3D point cloud data with Point-E for inserting a generated data into a 3D scene. More recently in 2025, although there are other accurate 3D generation models, even using the Point-E as an early 3D generative model can effectively support the pre-training with 3D synthetic data. In the experimental section, we compare our pre-training method with baseline methods indicated improved performance, demonstrating the efficacy of 3D generative models for 3D point cloud instance segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Tronchin, Tommy L\"ofstedt, Paolo Soda, Valerio Guarrasi</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of generative AI, particularly in medical imaging, confronts the trilemma of ensuring high fidelity, diversity, and efficiency in synthetic data generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise across various applications, they still face challenges like mode collapse and insufficient coverage of real data distributions. This work explores the use of GAN ensembles to overcome these limitations, specifically in the context of medical imaging. By solving a multi-objective optimisation problem that balances fidelity and diversity, we propose a method for selecting an optimal ensemble of GANs tailored for medical data. The selected ensemble is capable of generating diverse synthetic medical images that are representative of true data distributions and computationally efficient. Each model in the ensemble brings a unique contribution, ensuring minimal redundancy. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using three distinct medical datasets, testing 22 different GAN architectures with various loss functions and regularisation techniques. By sampling models at different training epochs, we crafted 110 unique configurations. The results highlight the capability of GAN ensembles to enhance the quality and utility of synthetic medical images, thereby improving the efficacy of downstream tasks such as diagnostic modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Yu Tian, Yipo Huang, Wei Lu, Shiqi Wang, Weisi Lin, Anderson Rocha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid and unrestrained advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a double-edged sword: while enabling unprecedented creativity, it also facilitates the generation of highly convincing deceptive content, undermining societal trust. As image generation techniques become increasingly sophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it necessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance trustworthiness and transparency. However, existing detection models primarily focus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model (LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies AI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable, and query-driven forensic insights. We first construct FakeChain dataset that contains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence, developed through a novel human-machine collaborative framework. Building upon it, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic awareness in LMMs. FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios. It can distinguish synthetic images with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations, free-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable enhancement strategies. Notably, despite being trained exclusively on qualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot quantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based probability estimation strategy. Furthermore, FakeScope exhibits strong generalization and in-the-wild ability, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelei Li, Hyunjin Kim, Fangneng Zhan, Ri-Zhao Qiu, Mazeyu Ji, Xiaojun Shan, Xueyan Zou, Paul Liang, Hanspeter Pfister, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer how an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties. Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272">Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Huang, Yihua Cheng, Kezhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wang, Xin Lan, Jizhe Zhou, Yuxin Tian, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Under limited data setting, GANs often struggle to navigate and effectively exploit the input latent space. Consequently, images generated from adjacent variables in a sparse input latent space may exhibit significant discrepancies in realism, leading to suboptimal consistency regularization (CR) outcomes. To address this, we propose \textit{SQ-GAN}, a novel approach that enhances CR by introducing a style space quantization scheme. This method transforms the sparse, continuous input latent space into a compact, structured discrete proxy space, allowing each element to correspond to a specific real data point, thereby improving CR performance. Instead of direct quantization, we first map the input latent variables into a less entangled ``style'' space and apply quantization using a learnable codebook. This enables each quantized code to control distinct factors of variation. Additionally, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align the codebook codes with features extracted from the training data by a foundation model, embedding external knowledge into the codebook and establishing a semantically rich vocabulary that properly describes the training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both discriminator robustness and generation quality with our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24298">Order Matters: On Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Video Probing for Recognizing Nearly Symmetric Actions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi, Alina Roitberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We study parameter-efficient image-to-video probing for the unaddressed challenge of recognizing nearly symmetric actions - visually similar actions that unfold in opposite temporal order (e.g., opening vs. closing a bottle). Existing probing mechanisms for image-pretrained models, such as DinoV2 and CLIP, rely on attention mechanism for temporal modeling but are inherently permutation-invariant, leading to identical predictions regardless of frame order. To address this, we introduce Self-attentive Temporal Embedding Probing (STEP), a simple yet effective approach designed to enforce temporal sensitivity in parameter-efficient image-to-video transfer. STEP enhances self-attentive probing with three key modifications: (1) a learnable frame-wise positional encoding, explicitly encoding temporal order; (2) a single global CLS token, for sequence coherence; and (3) a simplified attention mechanism to improve parameter efficiency. STEP outperforms existing image-to-video probing mechanisms by 3-15% across four activity recognition benchmarks with only 1/3 of the learnable parameters. On two datasets, it surpasses all published methods, including fully fine-tuned models. STEP shows a distinct advantage in recognizing nearly symmetric actions, surpassing other probing mechanisms by 9-19%. and parameter-heavier PEFT-based transfer methods by 5-15%. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding tissue motion in surgery is crucial to enable applications in downstream tasks such as segmentation, 3D reconstruction, virtual tissue landmarking, autonomous probe-based scanning, and subtask autonomy. Labeled data are essential to enabling algorithms in these downstream tasks since they allow us to quantify and train algorithms. This paper introduces a point tracking challenge to address this, wherein participants can submit their algorithms for quantification. The submitted algorithms are evaluated using a dataset named surgical tattoos in infrared (STIR), with the challenge aptly named the STIR Challenge 2024. The STIR Challenge 2024 comprises two quantitative components: accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy component tests the accuracy of algorithms on in vivo and ex vivo sequences. The efficiency component tests the latency of algorithm inference. The challenge was conducted as a part of MICCAI EndoVis 2024. In this challenge, we had 8 total teams, with 4 teams submitting before and 4 submitting after challenge day. This paper details the STIR Challenge 2024, which serves to move the field towards more accurate and efficient algorithms for spatial understanding in surgery.

<p>Abstract: World foundation models, which simulate the physical world by predicting future states from current observations and inputs, have become central to many applications in physical intelligence, including autonomous driving and robotics. However, these models require substantial computational resources for pretraining and are further constrained by available data during post-training. As such, scaling computation at test time emerges as both a critical and practical alternative to traditional model enlargement or re-training. In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way. Our findings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT provides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without retraining or increasing model size.

To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised pretraining method that improves segmentation performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. Our approach uses inpainting-based pretraining, where the model learns to reconstruct missing regions in aerial images, capturing their inherent structure before being fine-tuned for road extraction. This method improves generalization, enhances robustness to domain shifts, and is invariant to model architecture and dataset choice. Experiments show that our pretraining significantly boosts segmentation accuracy, especially in low-data regimes, making it a scalable solution for aerial image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological images present significant challenges in computational pathology. While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaizheng Liu, Jianqi Ma, Lingchen Sun, Xiangtao Kong, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant progress in diffusion prior-based image restoration, most existing methods apply uniform processing to the entire image, lacking the capability to perform region-customized image restoration according to user instructions. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely InstructRestore, to perform region-adjustable image restoration following human instructions. To achieve this, we first develop a data generation engine to produce training triplets, each consisting of a high-quality image, the target region description, and the corresponding region mask. With this engine and careful data screening, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 536,945 triplets to support the training and evaluation of this task. We then examine how to integrate the low-quality image features under the ControlNet architecture to adjust the degree of image details enhancement. Consequently, we develop a ControlNet-like model to identify the target region and allocate different integration scales to the target and surrounding regions, enabling region-customized image restoration that aligns with user instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstructRestore approach enables effective human-instructed image restoration, such as images with bokeh effects and user-instructed local enhancement. Our work advances the investigation of interactive image restoration and enhancement techniques. Data, code, and models will be found at https://github.com/shuaizhengliu/InstructRestore.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakiba Kheradmand, Delio Vicini, George Kopanas, Dmitry Lagun, Kwang Moo Yi, Mark Matthews, Andrea Tagliasacchi</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many application-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach that adapts hierarchical vision foundation models for real-time ultrasound image segmentation. Existing ultrasound segmentation methods often struggle with adaptability to new tasks, relying on costly manual annotations, while real-time approaches generally fail to match state-of-the-art performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an adaptive framework that leverages the vision foundation model Hiera to extract multi-scale features, interleaved with DINOv2 representations to enhance visual expressiveness. These enriched features are then decoded to produce precise and robust segmentation. We conduct extensive evaluations on six public datasets and one in-house dataset, covering both cardiac and thyroid ultrasound segmentation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and excels with limited supervision, surpassing nnUNet by over 20\% on average in the 1\% and 10\% data settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxim V. Shugaev, Vincent Chen, Maxim Karrenbach, Kyle Ashley, Bridget Kennedy, Naresh P. Cuntoor</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the problem of novel view synthesis in diverse scenes from small collections of RGB images. We propose ERUPT (Efficient Rendering with Unposed Patch Transformer) a state-of-the-art scene reconstruction model capable of efficient scene rendering using unposed imagery. We introduce patch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce the compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly efficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600 fps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned latent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets with sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach can generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset (MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from Mapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense imagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes with as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image quality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis tasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\% and decreases computational requirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis for diverse real-world scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Rui Wang, Yixiao Ge, Lu Qiu, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning.

<p>Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and current-frame occupancy prediction from camera images. UniOcc unifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D occupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative autonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics that do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Bao, Xiyu Zhang, Zehao Yu, Jiale Shi, Guofeng Zhang, Songyou Peng, Zhaopeng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural rendering has demonstrated remarkable success in high-quality 3D neural reconstruction and novel view synthesis with dense input views and accurate poses. However, applying it to extremely sparse, unposed views in unbounded 360{\deg} scenes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel neural rendering framework to accomplish the unposed and extremely sparse-view 3D reconstruction in unbounded 360{\deg} scenes. To resolve the spatial ambiguity inherent in unbounded scenes with sparse input views, we propose a layered Gaussian-based representation to effectively model the scene with distinct spatial layers. By employing a dense stereo reconstruction model to recover coarse geometry, we introduce a layer-specific bootstrap optimization to refine the noise and fill occluded regions in the reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an iterative fusion of reconstruction and generation alongside an uncertainty-aware training approach to facilitate mutual conditioning and enhancement between these two processes. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering quality and surface reconstruction accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lee Hsin-Ying, Kelvin C. K. Chan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: While text-to-image generative models can synthesize diverse and faithful contents, subject variation across multiple creations limits the application in long content generation. Existing approaches require time-consuming tuning, references for all subjects, or access to other creations. We introduce Contrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns) to effectively synthesize consistent subjects across multiple independent creations. The framework consists of a generative model and a mapping network, which transforms input latent codes into pseudo-words associated with certain instances of concepts. Users can generate consistent subjects with the same latent codes. To construct such associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the network to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive evaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs comparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility. We also demonstrate the potential of extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other object categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Li, Wenxuan Liu, Guoqiang Gong, Xiaobo Ding, Xian Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and industrial safety inspections. However, the complex optical environment and the limited resources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high accuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking Underwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the lightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a novel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer addition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational overhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a technique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps and is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the temporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual blocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO architecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset demonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an energy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the potential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in https://github.com/lwxfight/snn-underwater.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Chen, Yue Chen, Yuliang Xiu, Andreas Geiger, Anpei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feihan Feng, Jingxin Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Deciphering the neural mechanisms that transform sensory experiences into meaningful semantic representations is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While neuroimaging has mapped a distributed semantic network, the format and neural code of semantic content remain elusive, particularly for complex, naturalistic stimuli. Traditional brain decoding, focused on visual reconstruction, primarily captures low-level perceptual features, missing the deeper semantic essence guiding human cognition. Here, we introduce a paradigm shift by directly decoding fMRI signals into textual descriptions of viewed natural images. Our novel deep learning model, trained without visual input, achieves state-of-the-art semantic decoding performance, generating meaningful captions that capture the core semantic content of complex scenes. Neuroanatomical analysis reveals the critical role of higher-level visual regions, including MT+, ventral stream visual cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, in this semantic transformation. Category-specific decoding further demonstrates nuanced neural representations for semantic dimensions like animacy and motion. This text-based decoding approach provides a more direct and interpretable window into the brain's semantic encoding than visual reconstruction, offering a powerful new methodology for probing the neural basis of complex semantic processing, refining our understanding of the distributed semantic network, and potentially inspiring brain-inspired language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nooshin Bahador, Milad Lankarany</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectrograms are pivotal in time-frequency signal analysis, widely used in audio processing and computational neuroscience. Chirp-like patterns in electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms (marked by linear or exponential frequency sweep) are key biomarkers for seizure dynamics, but automated tools for their detection, localization, and feature extraction are lacking. This study bridges this gap by fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on synthetic spectrograms, augmented with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to boost adaptability. We generated 100000 synthetic spectrograms with chirp parameters, creating the first large-scale benchmark for chirp localization. These spectrograms mimic neural chirps using linear or exponential frequency sweep, Gaussian noise, and smoothing. A ViT model, adapted for regression, predicted chirp parameters. LoRA fine-tuned the attention layers, enabling efficient updates to the pre-trained backbone. Training used MSE loss and the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler and early stopping to curb overfitting. Only three features were targeted: Chirp Start Time (Onset Time), Chirp Start Frequency (Onset Frequency), and Chirp End Frequency (Offset Frequency). Performance was evaluated via Pearson correlation between predicted and actual labels. Results showed strong alignment: 0.9841 correlation for chirp start time, with stable inference times (137 to 140s) and minimal bias in error distributions. This approach offers a tool for chirp analysis in EEG time-frequency representation, filling a critical methodological void.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qin, Feng Liu, Lu Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding human emotions across diverse communication channels. While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generation of audio-driven talking head videos is a key challenge in computer vision and graphics, with applications in virtual avatars and digital media. Traditional approaches often struggle with capturing the complex interaction between audio and facial dynamics, leading to lip synchronization and visual quality issues. In this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based framework, Dual Audio-Centric Modality Coupling (DAMC), which effectively integrates content and dynamic features from audio inputs. By leveraging a dual encoder structure, DAMC captures semantic content through the Content-Aware Encoder and ensures precise visual synchronization through the Dynamic-Sync Encoder. These features are fused using a Cross-Synchronized Fusion Module (CSFM), enhancing content representation and lip synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in key metrics such as lip synchronization accuracy and image quality, demonstrating robust generalization across various audio inputs, including synthetic speech from text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our results provide a promising solution for high-quality, audio-driven talking head generation and present a scalable approach for creating realistic talking heads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qin, Feng Liu, Lu Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of computer graphics, the ability to learn continuously from non-stationary data streams while adapting to new visual patterns and mitigating catastrophic forgetting is of paramount importance. Existing approaches often struggle to capture and represent the essential characteristics of evolving visual concepts, hindering their applicability to dynamic graphics tasks. In this paper, we propose Ancestral Mamba, a novel approach that integrates online prototype learning into a selective discriminant space model for efficient and robust online continual learning. The key components of our approach include Ancestral Prototype Adaptation (APA), which continuously refines and builds upon learned visual prototypes, and Mamba Feedback (MF), which provides targeted feedback to adapt to challenging visual patterns. APA enables the model to continuously adapt its prototypes, building upon ancestral knowledge to tackle new challenges, while MF acts as a targeted feedback mechanism, focusing on challenging classes and refining their representations. Extensive experiments on graphics-oriented datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate the superior performance of Ancestral Mamba compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and forgetting mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-human primates (NHPs) serve as critical models for understanding human brain function and neurological disorders due to their close evolutionary relationship with humans. Accurate brain tissue segmentation in NHPs is critical for understanding neurological disorders, but challenging due to the scarcity of annotated NHP brain MRI datasets, the small size of the NHP brain, the limited resolution of available imaging data and the anatomical differences between human and NHP brains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing STU-Net with transfer learning to leverage knowledge transferred from human brain MRI data to enhance segmentation accuracy in the NHP brain MRI, particularly when training data is limited. The combination of STU-Net and transfer learning effectively delineates complex tissue boundaries and captures fine anatomical details specific to NHP brains. Notably, our method demonstrated improvement in segmenting small subcortical structures such as putamen and thalamus that are challenging to resolve with limited spatial resolution and tissue contrast, and achieved DSC of over 0.88, IoU over 0.8 and HD95 under 7. This study introduces a robust method for multi-class brain tissue segmentation in NHPs, potentially accelerating research in evolutionary neuroscience and preclinical studies of neurological disorders relevant to human health.</p>

Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present \textit{VizFlyt}, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on \textit{VizFlyt} for the future.

<p>Abstract: With the increasing complexity of mobile device applications, these devices are evolving toward high mobility. This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in terms of achieving high accuracy and low latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution, low latency, and energy efficiency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-mobility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, the lack of inherent semantic information, and the large data volume pose significant challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature over the period 2014-2024, provides a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing systems, covering fundamental principles, event abstraction methods, algorithmic advancements, hardware and software acceleration strategies. We also discuss key applications of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow estimation, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting the challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving event camera hardware with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms to enhance perception. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with curated resources and recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a valuable reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M Rita Verdelho, Alexandre Bernardino, Catarina Barata</p>
<p>Abstract: Oncologists often rely on a multitude of data, including whole-slide images (WSIs), to guide therapeutic decisions, aiming for the best patient outcome. However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Almeida, Plinio Moreno, Catarina Barata</p>
<p>Abstract: High hospital readmission rates are associated with significant costs and health risks for patients. Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</p>

<p>Abstract: In modern cancer research, the vast volume of medical data generated is often underutilised due to challenges related to patient privacy. The OncoReg Challenge addresses this issue by enabling researchers to develop and validate image registration methods through a two-phase framework that ensures patient privacy while fostering the development of more generalisable AI models. Phase one involves working with a publicly available dataset, while phase two focuses on training models on a private dataset within secure hospital networks. OncoReg builds upon the foundation established by the Learn2Reg Challenge by incorporating the registration of interventional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with standard planning fan-beam CT (FBCT) images in radiotherapy. Accurate image registration is crucial in oncology, particularly for dynamic treatment adjustments in image-guided radiotherapy, where precise alignment is necessary to minimise radiation exposure to healthy tissues while effectively targeting tumours. This work details the methodology and data behind the OncoReg Challenge and provides a comprehensive analysis of the competition entries and results. Findings reveal that feature extraction plays a pivotal role in this registration task. A new method emerging from this challenge demonstrated its versatility, while established approaches continue to perform comparably to newer techniques. Both deep learning and classical approaches still play significant roles in image registration, with the combination of methods - particularly in feature extraction - proving most effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjoy Chowdhury, Hanan Gani, Nishit Anand, Sayan Nag, Ruohan Gao, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Salman Khan, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning optimization have greatly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, existing work fails to address the complexities of audio-visual scenarios, underscoring the need for further research. In this paper, we introduce AURELIA, a novel actor-critic based audio-visual (AV) reasoning framework that distills structured, step-by-step reasoning into AVLLMs at test time, improving their ability to process complex multi-modal inputs without additional training or fine-tuning. To further advance AVLLM reasoning skills, we present AVReasonBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 4500 audio-visual questions, each paired with detailed step-by-step reasoning. Our benchmark spans six distinct tasks, including AV-GeoIQ, which evaluates AV reasoning combined with geographical and cultural knowledge. Evaluating 18 AVLLMs on AVReasonBench reveals significant limitations in their multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Using AURELIA, we achieve up to a 100% relative improvement, demonstrating its effectiveness. This performance gain highlights the potential of reasoning-enhanced data generation for advancing AVLLMs in real-world applications. Our code and data will be publicly released at: https: //github.com/schowdhury671/aurelia.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Anh Dinh, Itai Lang, Hyunwoo Kim, Oded Stein, Rana Hanocka</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Geometry in Style, a new method for identity-preserving mesh stylization. Existing techniques either adhere to the original shape through overly restrictive deformations such as bump maps or significantly modify the input shape using expressive deformations that may introduce artifacts or alter the identity of the source shape. In contrast, we represent a deformation of a triangle mesh as a target normal vector for each vertex neighborhood. The deformations we recover from target normals are expressive enough to enable detailed stylizations yet restrictive enough to preserve the shape's identity. We achieve such deformations using our novel differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible (dARAP) layer, a neural-network-ready adaptation of the classical ARAP algorithm which we use to solve for per-vertex rotations and deformed vertices. As a differentiable layer, dARAP is paired with a visual loss from a text-to-image model to drive deformations toward style prompts, altogether giving us Geometry in Style.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn M\"oller, Lucas G\"ornhardt, Tim Fingscheidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer architectures prominently lead single-image super-resolution (SISR) benchmarks, reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Their strong representative power, however, comes with a higher demand for training data compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For many real-world SR applications, the availability of high-quality HR training images is not given, sparking interest in LR-only training methods. The LR-only SISR benchmark mimics this condition by allowing only low-resolution (LR) images for model training. For a 4x super-resolution, this effectively reduces the amount of available training data to 6.25% of the HR image pixels, which puts the employment of a data-hungry transformer model into question. In this work, we are the first to utilize a lightweight vision transformer model with LR-only training methods addressing the unsupervised SISR LR-only benchmark. We adopt and configure a recent LR-only training method from microscopy image super-resolution to macroscopic real-world data, resulting in our multi-scale training method for bicubic degradation (MSTbic). Furthermore, we compare it with reference methods and prove its effectiveness both for a transformer and a CNN model. We evaluate on the classic SR benchmark datasets Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109, and show superior performance over state-of-the-art (so far: CNN-based) LR-only SISR methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng-Lin Liu, Hongbo Fu, Xintao Wang, Weicai Ye, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Lin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation and editing conditioned on text prompts or images have undergone significant advancements. However, challenges remain in accurately controlling global layout and geometry details solely by texts, and supporting motion control and local modification through images. In this paper, we aim to achieve sketch-based spatial and motion control for video generation and support fine-grained editing of real or synthetic videos. Based on the DiT video generation model, we propose a memory-efficient control structure with sketch control blocks that predict residual features of skipped DiT blocks. Sketches are drawn on one or two keyframes (at arbitrary time points) for easy interaction. To propagate such temporally sparse sketch conditions across all frames, we propose an inter-frame attention mechanism to analyze the relationship between the keyframes and each video frame. For sketch-based video editing, we design an additional video insertion module that maintains consistency between the newly edited content and the original video's spatial feature and dynamic motion. During inference, we use latent fusion for the accurate preservation of unedited regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SketchVideo achieves superior performance in controllable video generation and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunsik Jeon, Satoshi Koide, Yu Wang, Zhankui He, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational recommender systems engage users in dialogues to refine their needs and provide more personalized suggestions. Although textual information suffices for many domains, visually driven categories such as fashion or home decor potentially require detailed visual information related to color, style, or design. To address this challenge, we propose LaViC (Large Vision-Language Conversational Recommendation Framework), a novel approach that integrates compact image representations into dialogue-based recommendation systems. LaViC leverages a large vision-language model in a two-stage process: (1) visual knowledge self-distillation, which condenses product images from hundreds of tokens into a small set of visual tokens in a self-distillation manner, significantly reducing computational overhead, and (2) recommendation prompt tuning, which enables the model to incorporate both dialogue context and distilled visual tokens, providing a unified mechanism for capturing textual and visual features. To support rigorous evaluation of visually-aware conversational recommendation, we construct a new dataset by aligning Reddit conversations with Amazon product listings across multiple visually oriented categories (e.g., fashion, beauty, and home). This dataset covers realistic user queries and product appearances in domains where visual details are crucial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaViC significantly outperforms text-only conversational recommendation methods and open-source vision-language baselines. Moreover, LaViC achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to prominent proprietary baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), demonstrating the necessity of explicitly using visual data for capturing product attributes and showing the effectiveness of our vision-language integration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Zhu, Mingxuan Ju, Yozen Liu, Danai Koutra, Neil Shah, Tong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) has become a powerful paradigm in recommendation systems that implicitly links modality and semantics to item representation, in contrast to previous methods that relied on non-semantic item identifiers in autoregressive models. However, previous research has predominantly treated modalities in isolation, typically assuming item content is unimodal (usually text). We argue that this is a significant limitation given the rich, multimodal nature of real-world data and the potential sensitivity of GR models to modality choices and usage. Our work aims to explore the critical problem of Multimodal Generative Recommendation (MGR), highlighting the importance of modality choices in GR nframeworks. We reveal that GR models are particularly sensitive to different modalities and examine the challenges in achieving effective GR when multiple modalities are available. By evaluating design strategies for effectively leveraging multiple modalities, we identify key challenges and introduce MGR-LF++, an enhanced late fusion framework that employs contrastive modality alignment and special tokens to denote different modalities, achieving a performance improvement of over 20% compared to single-modality alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: We human rely on a wide range of commonsense knowledge to interact with an extensive number and categories of objects in the physical world. Likewise, such commonsense knowledge is also crucial for robots to successfully develop generalized object manipulation skills. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) have showcased their impressive capabilities in acquiring commonsense knowledge and conducting commonsense reasoning, effectively grounding this semantic-level knowledge produced by LLMs to the physical world to thoroughly guide robots in generalized articulated object manipulation remains a challenge that has not been sufficiently addressed. To this end, we introduce analytic concepts, procedurally defined upon mathematical symbolism that can be directly computed and simulated by machines. By leveraging the analytic concepts as a bridge between the semantic-level knowledge inferred by LLMs and the physical world where real robots operate, we are able to figure out the knowledge of object structure and functionality with physics-informed representations, and then use the physically grounded knowledge to instruct robot control policies for generalized, interpretable and accurate articulated object manipulation. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhang, Meng Gai, Sheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior foveated rendering methods often suffer from a limitation where the shading load escalates with increasing display resolution, leading to decreased efficiency, particularly when dealing with retinal-level resolutions. To tackle this challenge, we begin with the essence of the human visual system (HVS) perception and present visual acuity-consistent foveated rendering (VaFR), aiming to achieve exceptional rendering performance at retinal-level resolutions. Specifically, we propose a method with a novel log-polar mapping function derived from the human visual acuity model, which accommodates the natural bandwidth of the visual system. This mapping function and its associated shading rate guarantee a consistent output of rendering information, regardless of variations in the display resolution of the VR HMD. Consequently, our VaFR outperforms alternative methods, improving rendering speed while preserving perceptual visual quality, particularly when operating at retinal resolutions. We validate our approach using both the rasterization and ray-casting rendering pipelines. We also validate our approach using different binocular rendering strategies for HMD devices. In diverse testing scenarios, our approach delivers better perceptual visual quality than prior foveated rendering while achieving an impressive speedup of 6.5$\times$-9.29$\times$ for deferred rendering of 3D scenarios and an even more powerful speedup of 10.4$\times$-16.4$\times$ for ray-casting at retinal resolution. Additionally, our approach significantly enhances the rendering performance of binocular 8K path tracing, achieving smooth frame rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alice E. A. Allen, Emily Shinkle, Roxana Bujack, Nicholas Lubbers</p>
<p>Abstract: The representation of atomic configurations for machine learning models has led to the development of numerous descriptors, often to describe the local environment of atoms. However, many of these representations are incomplete and/or functionally dependent. Incomplete descriptor sets are unable to represent all meaningful changes in the atomic environment. Complete constructions of atomic environment descriptors, on the other hand, often suffer from a high degree of functional dependence, where some descriptors can be written as functions of the others. These redundant descriptors do not provide additional power to discriminate between different atomic environments and increase the computational burden. By employing techniques from the pattern recognition literature to existing atomistic representations, we remove descriptors that are functions of other descriptors to produce the smallest possible set that satisfies completeness. We apply this in two ways: first we refine an existing description, the Atomistic Cluster Expansion. We show that this yields a more efficient subset of descriptors. Second, we augment an incomplete construction based on a scalar neural network, yielding a new message-passing network architecture that can recognize up to 5-body patterns in each neuron by taking advantage of an optimal set of Cartesian tensor invariants. This architecture shows strong accuracy on state-of-the-art benchmarks while retaining low computational cost. Our results not only yield improved models, but point the way to classes of invariant bases that minimize cost while maximizing expressivity for a host of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs) is an established benchmark to examine the ability to perform high-level abstract visual reasoning (AVR). Despite the current success of algorithms that solve this task, humans can generalize beyond a given puzzle and create new puzzles given a set of rules, whereas machines remain locked in solving a fixed puzzle from a curated choice list. We propose Generative Visual Puzzles (GenVP), a framework to model the entire RPM generation process, a substantially more challenging task. Our model's capability spans from generating multiple solutions for one specific problem prompt to creating complete new puzzles out of the desired set of rules. Experiments on five different datasets indicate that GenVP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance both in puzzle-solving accuracy and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in 22 OOD scenarios. Compared to SOTA generative approaches, which struggle to solve RPMs when the feasible solution space increases, GenVP efficiently generalizes to these challenging setups. Moreover, our model demonstrates the ability to produce a wide range of complete RPMs given a set of abstract rules by effectively capturing the relationships between abstract rules and visual object properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in neural rendering technologies and their supporting devices have paved the way for immersive 3D experiences, significantly transforming human interaction with intelligent devices across diverse applications. However, achieving the desired real-time rendering speeds for immersive interactions is still hindered by (1) the lack of a universal algorithmic solution for different application scenarios and (2) the dedication of existing devices or accelerators to merely specific rendering pipelines. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a unified neural rendering accelerator that caters to a wide array of typical neural rendering pipelines, enabling real-time and on-device rendering across different applications while maintaining both efficiency and compatibility. Our accelerator design is based on the insight that, although neural rendering pipelines vary and their algorithm designs are continually evolving, they typically share common operators, predominantly executing similar workloads. Building on this insight, we propose a reconfigurable hardware architecture that can dynamically adjust dataflow to align with specific rendering metric requirements for diverse applications, effectively supporting both typical and the latest hybrid rendering pipelines. Benchmarking experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed accelerator. The proposed unified accelerator stands out as the first solution capable of achieving real-time neural rendering across varied representative pipelines on edge devices, potentially paving the way for the next generation of neural graphics applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, model merging methods have demonstrated powerful strengths in combining abilities on various tasks from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous model merging methods mainly focus on merging homogeneous models with identical architecture, they meet challenges when dealing with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with inherent heterogeneous property, including differences in model architecture and the asymmetry in the parameter space. In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel model merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the challenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we first design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs with different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model weights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in the hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method for model merging. As the first model merging method capable of merging heterogeneous MLLMs without labeled data, extensive experiments on various model combinations demonstrated that AdaMMS outperforms previous model merging methods on various vision-language benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce non-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a holistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability. Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhecheng Li, Guoxian Song, Yujun Cai, Zhen Xiong, Junsong Yuan, Yiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swarnava Bhattacharyya, Umapada Pal, Tapabrata Chakraborti</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning based diagnostic AI systems based on medical images are starting to provide similar performance as human experts. However these data hungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be adopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of transparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models, which are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to provide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the embeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not interpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To address this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the predictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model across patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the tasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets. The significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method independent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level but also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a model-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which helped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on uncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus we show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of the feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus advance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyao Shi, Zhuolun Zhao, Tianyou Wang, Ian Pedroza, Amy Luo, Jie Wang, Jason Ma, Dinesh Jayaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent advances in robotic manipulation have come through imitation learning, yet these rely largely on mimicking a particularly hard-to-acquire form of demonstrations: those collected on the same robot in the same room with the same objects as the trained policy must handle at test time. In contrast, large pre-recorded human video datasets demonstrating manipulation skills in-the-wild already exist, which contain valuable information for robots. Is it possible to distill a repository of useful robotic skill policies out of such data without any additional requirements on robot-specific demonstrations or exploration? We present the first such system ZeroMimic, that generates immediately deployable image goal-conditioned skill policies for several common categories of manipulation tasks (opening, closing, pouring, pick&place, cutting, and stirring) each capable of acting upon diverse objects and across diverse unseen task setups. ZeroMimic is carefully designed to exploit recent advances in semantic and geometric visual understanding of human videos, together with modern grasp affordance detectors and imitation policy classes. After training ZeroMimic on the popular EpicKitchens dataset of ego-centric human videos, we evaluate its out-of-the-box performance in varied real-world and simulated kitchen settings with two different robot embodiments, demonstrating its impressive abilities to handle these varied tasks. To enable plug-and-play reuse of ZeroMimic policies on other task setups and robots, we release software and policy checkpoints of our skill policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Springenberg, Noelia Otero, Yuxin Xue, Jackie Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Renewable resources are strongly dependent on local and large-scale weather situations. Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two weeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to the energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of surface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves spatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times. Leveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion models, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling super-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density associated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and lead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an efficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to super-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target. The innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale arbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid resolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting model errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed forecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality, outperforming baselines up to week 3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rihui Zhang, Haiming Zhu, Jingtong Zhao, Lei Zhang, Fang-Fang Yin, Chunhao Wang, Zhenyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate evaluation of regional lung ventilation is essential for the management and treatment of lung cancer patients, supporting assessments of pulmonary function, optimization of therapeutic strategies, and monitoring of treatment response. Currently, ventilation scintigraphy using nuclear medicine techniques is widely employed in clinical practice; however, it is often time-consuming, costly, and entails additional radiation exposure. In this study, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify regions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset was analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and voxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the respiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming temporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated voxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions, we developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were generated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions. The proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range) Dice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78 (0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases. The temporal saliency map explained three key radiomic sequences in ventilation quantification: during lung exhalation, compromised pulmonary function region typically exhibits (1) an increasing trend of intensity and (2) a decreasing trend of homogeneity, in contrast to healthy lung tissue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Bayer, Christian Rathgeb</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric systems strive to balance security and usability. The use of multi-biometric systems combining multiple biometric modalities is usually recommended for high-security applications. However, the presentation of multiple biometric modalities can impair the user-friendliness of the overall system and might not be necessary in all cases. In this work, we present a simple but flexible approach to increase the privacy protection of homomorphically encrypted multi-biometric reference templates while enabling adaptation to security requirements at run-time: An adaptive multi-biometric fusion with fully homomorphic encryption (AMB-FHE). AMB-FHE is benchmarked against a bimodal biometric database consisting of the CASIA iris and MCYT fingerprint datasets using deep neural networks for feature extraction. Our contribution is easy to implement and increases the flexibility of biometric authentication while offering increased privacy protection through joint encryption of templates from multiple modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikel Zhobro, Andreas Ren\'e Geist, Georg Martius</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning physics simulations from video data requires maintaining spatial and temporal consistency, a challenge often addressed with strong inductive biases or ground-truth 3D information -- limiting scalability and generalization. We introduce 3DGSim, a 3D physics simulator that learns object dynamics end-to-end from multi-view RGB videos. It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit connectivity constraints. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic and cloth-like interactions, along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multi-body interactions and novel scene edits.</p>

<p>Abstract: In colonoscopy, 80% of the missed polyps could be detected with the help of Deep Learning models. In the search for algorithms capable of addressing this challenge, foundation models emerge as promising candidates. Their zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, facilitate generalization to new data or tasks without extensive fine-tuning. A concept that is particularly advantageous in the medical imaging domain, where large annotated datasets for traditional training are scarce. In this context, a comprehensive evaluation of foundation models for polyp segmentation was conducted, assessing both detection and delimitation. For the study, three different colonoscopy datasets have been employed to compare the performance of five different foundation models, DINOv2, YOLO-World, GroundingDINO, SAM and MedSAM, against two benchmark networks, YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN. Results show that the success of foundation models in polyp characterization is highly dependent on domain specialization. For optimal performance in medical applications, domain-specific models are essential, and generic models require fine-tuning to achieve effective results. Through this specialization, foundation models demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detection and segmentation models, with some models even excelling in zero-shot evaluation; outperforming fine-tuned models on unseen data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information Visualization (InfoVis) systems utilize visual representations to enhance data interpretation. Understanding how visual attention is allocated is essential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking (ET) data presents challenges related to cost, privacy, and scalability. Computational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby advancing InfoVis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40 participants who analyzed graphs while responding to questions of varying complexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths with synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer. Our research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how question complexity and number of nodes influence performance. This work contributes to the development of predictive modeling in visual analytics, offering insights that can enhance the design and effectiveness of InfoVis systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan, Dongwen Tang, Pingzhi Li, Kai Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuf Dalva, Hamza Pehlivan, Said Fahri Altindis, Aysegul Dundar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of instance segmentation models with respect to real-world image corruptions as well as out-of-domain image collections, e.g. images captured by a different set-up than the training dataset. The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multi-task training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multi-stage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel A. P. Oliveira, David Martins de Matos</p>
<p>Abstract: The computer vision community has seen a shift from convolutional-based to pure transformer architectures for both image and video tasks. Training a transformer from zero for these tasks usually requires a lot of data and computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch. We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixing Zhang, Ligong Han, Arnab Ghosh, Dimitris Metaxas, Jian Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works on diffusion models have demonstrated a strong capability for conditioning image generation, e.g., text-guided image synthesis. Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

Facial attribute editing task faces the challenges of targeted attribute editing with controllable strength and disentanglement in the representations of attributes to preserve the other attributes during edits. For this goal, inspired by the latent space factorization works of fixed pretrained GANs, we design the attribute editing by latent space factorization, and for each attribute, we learn a linear direction that is orthogonal to the others. We train these directions with orthogonality constraints and disentanglement losses. To project images to semantically organized latent spaces, we set an encoder-decoder architecture with attention-based skip connections. We extensively compare with previous image translation algorithms and editing with pretrained GAN works. Our extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of drone images is critical for various aerial vision tasks as it provides essential semantic details to understand scenes on the ground. Ensuring high accuracy of semantic segmentation models for drones requires access to diverse, large-scale, and high-resolution datasets, which are often scarce in the field of aerial image processing. While existing datasets typically focus on urban scenes and are relatively small, our Varied Drone Dataset (VDD) addresses these limitations by offering a large-scale, densely labeled collection of 400 high-resolution images spanning 7 classes. This dataset features various scenes in urban, industrial, rural, and natural areas, captured from different camera angles and under diverse lighting conditions. We also make new annotations to UDD and UAVid, integrating them under VDD annotation standards, to create the Integrated Drone Dataset (IDD). We train seven state-of-the-art models on drone datasets as baselines. It's expected that our dataset will generate considerable interest in drone image segmentation and serve as a foundation for other drone vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhecan Wang, Rui Sun, Haoxuan You, Noel Codella, Kai-Wei Chang, Shih-Fu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language tasks, such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR are challenging because they require the model's reasoning ability to understand the semantics of the visual world and natural language. Supervised methods working for vision-language tasks have been well-studied. However, solving these tasks in a zero-shot setting is less explored. Since Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown remarkable zero-shot performance on image-text matching, previous works utilized its strong zero-shot ability by converting vision-language tasks into an image-text matching problem, and they mainly consider global-level matching (e.g., the whole image or sentence). However, we find visual and textual fine-grained information, e.g., keywords in the sentence and objects in the image, can be fairly informative for semantics understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a unified framework to take advantage of the fine-grained information for zero-shot vision-language learning, covering multiple tasks such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR. Our experiments show that our framework outperforms former zero-shot methods on VQA and achieves substantial improvement on SNLI-VE and VCR. Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: A new trend in the computer vision community is to capture objects of interest following flexible human command represented by a natural language prompt. However, the progress of using language prompts in driving scenarios is stuck in a bottleneck due to the scarcity of paired prompt-instance data. To address this challenge, we propose the first object-centric language prompt set for driving scenes within 3D, multi-view, and multi-frame space, named NuPrompt. It expands nuScenes dataset by constructing a total of 40,147 language descriptions, each referring to an average of 7.4 object tracklets. Based on the object-text pairs from the new benchmark, we formulate a novel prompt-based driving task, \ie, employing a language prompt to predict the described object trajectory across views and frames. Furthermore, we provide a simple end-to-end baseline model based on Transformer, named PromptTrack. Experiments show that our PromptTrack achieves impressive performance on NuPrompt. We hope this work can provide some new insights for the self-driving community. The data and code have been released at https://github.com/wudongming97/Prompt4Driving.</p>

As its most significant feature, a task-specific connected dominating set is extracted in IRAv4 to serve as a more reliable and accurate reference for rotation local-to-global alignment. This alignment reference is incrementally constructed, together with the absolute rotations of the vertices belong to it simultaneously estimated. Comprehensive evaluations are performed on the 1DSfM dataset, by which the effectiveness of both the reference construction method and the entire rotation averaging pipeline proposed in this paper is demonstrated.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient relocalization is essential for intelligent vehicles when GPS reception is insufficient or sensor-based localization fails. Recent advances in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation allow for accurate estimation of local scene appearance and in turn, can benefit the relocalization of the vehicle. However, one downside of BEV methods is the heavy computation required to leverage the geometric constraints. This paper presents U-BEV, a U-Net inspired architecture that extends the current state-of-the-art by allowing the BEV to reason about the scene on multiple height layers before flattening the BEV features. We show that this extension boosts the performance of the U-BEV by up to 4.11 IoU. Additionally, we combine the encoded neural BEV with a differentiable template matcher to perform relocalization on neural SD-map data. The model is fully end-to-end trainable and outperforms transformer-based BEV methods of similar computational complexity by 1.7 to 2.8 mIoU and BEV-based relocalization by over 26% Recall Accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre Ye, Sebastin Santy, Jena D. Hwang, Amy X. Zhang, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision often treats human perception as homogeneous: an implicit assumption that visual stimuli are perceived similarly by everyone. This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Lou, Shu Zhang, Hong-Yu Zhou, Sibei Yang, Chuan Wu, Yizhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have integrated convolutions into transformers to introduce inductive bias and improve generalization performance. However, the static nature of conventional convolution prevents it from dynamically adapting to input variations, resulting in a representation discrepancy between convolution and self-attention as the latter computes attention maps dynamically. Furthermore, when stacking token mixers that consist of convolution and self-attention to form a deep network, the static nature of convolution hinders the fusion of features previously generated by self-attention into convolution kernels. These two limitations result in a sub-optimal representation capacity of the entire network. To find a solution, we propose a lightweight Dual Dynamic Token Mixer (D-Mixer) to simultaneously learn global and local dynamics via computing input-dependent global and local aggregation weights. D-Mixer works by applying an efficient global attention module and an input-dependent depthwise convolution separately on evenly split feature segments, endowing the network with strong inductive bias and an enlarged receptive field. We use D-Mixer as the basic building block to design TransXNet, a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer vision backbone network that delivers compelling performance. In the ImageNet-1K classification, TransXNet-T surpasses Swin-T by 0.3% in top-1 accuracy while requiring less than half of the computational cost. Furthermore, TransXNet-S and TransXNet-B exhibit excellent model scalability, achieving top-1 accuracy of 83.8% and 84.6% respectively, with reasonable computational costs. Additionally, our proposed network architecture demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various dense prediction tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art networks while having lower computational costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyang Chen, Hanjiang Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR), which takes a textual modification and a reference image as a query to retrieve a target image without triplet labeling, has gained more and more attention in data mining. Current ZS-CIR research mainly relies on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP. However, the pre-trained vision-language models and CIR tasks have substantial discrepancies, where the vision-language models focus on learning the similarities but CIR aims to learn the modifications of the image guided by text. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlabeled and pre-trained masked tuning approach, which reduces the gap between the pre-trained vision-language model and the downstream CIR task. First, to reduce the gap, we reformulate the contrastive learning of the vision-language model as the CIR task, where we randomly mask input image patches to generate $\langle$masked image, text, image$\rangle$ triplet from an image-text pair. Then, we propose a simple but novel pre-trained masked tuning method, which uses the text and the masked image to learn the modifications of the original image. With such a simple design, the proposed masked tuning can learn to better capture fine-grained text-guided modifications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the baseline models on four ZS-CIR datasets, including FashionIQ, CIRR, CIRCO, and GeneCIS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Mikriukov, Gesina Schwalbe, Korinna Bade</p>
<p>Abstract: Insights into the learned latent representations are imperative for verifying deep neural networks (DNNs) in critical computer vision (CV) tasks. Therefore, state-of-the-art supervised Concept-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (C-XAI) methods associate user-defined concepts like ``car'' each with a single vector in the DNN latent space (concept embedding vector). In the case of concept segmentation, these linearly separate between activation map pixels belonging to a concept and those belonging to background. Existing methods for concept segmentation, however, fall short of capturing implicitly learned sub-concepts (e.g., the DNN might split car into ``proximate car'' and ``distant car''), and overlap of user-defined concepts (e.g., between ``bus'' and ``truck''). In other words, they do not capture the full distribution of concept representatives in latent space. For the first time, this work shows that these simplifications are frequently broken and that distribution information can be particularly useful for understanding DNN-learned notions of sub-concepts, concept confusion, and concept outliers. To allow exploration of learned concept distributions, we propose a novel local concept analysis framework. Instead of optimizing a single global concept vector on the complete dataset, it generates a local concept embedding (LoCE) vector for each individual sample. We use the distribution formed by LoCEs to explore the latent concept distribution by fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), hierarchical clustering, and concept-level information retrieval and outlier detection. Despite its context sensitivity, our method's concept segmentation performance is competitive to global baselines. Analysis results are obtained on three datasets and six diverse vision DNN architectures, including vision transformers (ViTs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Yufan Ren, Tong Zhang, Zheng Dang, Wenbing Tao, Sabine S\"usstrunk, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Point Cloud Registration (PCR) estimates the relative rigid transformation between two point clouds of the same scene. Despite significant progress with learning-based approaches, existing methods still face challenges when the overlapping region between the two point clouds is small. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-step refinement network that refines the registration quality at each step by leveraging the information from the preceding step. To achieve this, we introduce a training procedure and a refinement network. Firstly, to adapt the network to the current step, we utilize a generalized one-way attention mechanism, which prioritizes the last step's estimated overlapping region, and we condition the network on step indices. Secondly, instead of training the network to map either random transformations or a fixed pre-trained model's estimations to the ground truth, we train it on transformations with varying registration qualities, ranging from accurate to inaccurate, thereby enhancing the network's adaptiveness and robustness. Despite its conceptual simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and KITTI benchmarks. Notably, on 3DLoMatch, our method reaches 80.4% recall rate, with an absolute improvement of 1.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Hu, Han Jiang, Hao Liu, Kun Wang, Haoyu Tang, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, temporal action localization (TAL) has garnered significant interest in information retrieval community. However, existing supervised/weakly supervised methods are heavily dependent on extensive labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although some unsupervised methods have utilized the ``iteratively clustering and localization'' paradigm for TAL, they still suffer from two pivotal impediments: 1) unsatisfactory video clustering confidence, and 2) unreliable video pseudolabels for model training. To address these limitations, we present a novel self-paced iterative learning model to enhance clustering and localization training simultaneously, thereby facilitating more effective unsupervised TAL. Concretely, we improve the clustering confidence through exploring the contextual feature-robust visual information. Thereafter, we design two (constant- and variable- speed) incremental instance learning strategies for easy-to-hard model training, thus ensuring the reliability of these video pseudolabels and further improving overall localization performance. Extensive experiments on two public datasets have substantiated the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Yang, Zhi Qiao, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, scene text recognition has attracted more and more attention due to its diverse applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an encoder-decoder framework with the attention mechanism, autoregressively generating text from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, this sequential decoding strategy constrains the inference speed. Conversely, non-autoregressive models provide faster, simultaneous predictions but often sacrifice accuracy. Although utilizing an explicit language model can improve performance, it burdens the computational load. Besides, separating linguistic knowledge from vision information may harm the final prediction. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that uses a parallel and iterative decoder that adopts an easy-first decoding strategy. Furthermore, we regard text recognition as an image-based conditional text generation task and utilize the discrete diffusion strategy, ensuring exhaustive exploration of bidirectional contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results on the benchmark datasets, including both Chinese and English text images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Karimi Monsefi, Payam Karisani, Mengxi Zhou, Stacey Choi, Nathan Doble, Heng Ji, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard modern machine-learning-based imaging methods have faced challenges in medical applications due to the high cost of dataset construction and, thereby, the limited labeled training data available. Additionally, upon deployment, these methods are usually used to process a large volume of data on a daily basis, imposing a high maintenance cost on medical facilities. In this paper, we introduce a new neural network architecture, termed LoGoNet, with a tailored self-supervised learning (SSL) method to mitigate such challenges. LoGoNet integrates a novel feature extractor within a U-shaped architecture, leveraging Large Kernel Attention (LKA) and a dual encoding strategy to capture both long-range and short-range feature dependencies adeptly. This is in contrast to existing methods that rely on increasing network capacity to enhance feature extraction. This combination of novel techniques in our model is especially beneficial in medical image segmentation, given the difficulty of learning intricate and often irregular body organ shapes, such as the spleen. Complementary, we propose a novel SSL method tailored for 3D images to compensate for the lack of large labeled datasets. The method combines masking and contrastive learning techniques within a multi-task learning framework and is compatible with both Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN-based models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in numerous tasks across two standard datasets (i.e., BTCV and MSD). Benchmark comparisons with eight state-of-the-art models highlight LoGoNet's superior performance in both inference time and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhou, Chen Long, Yue Xie, Jialiang Wang, Conglang Zhang, Boheng Li, Haiping Wang, Zhe Chen, Zhen Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end models capable of handling multiple sub-tasks in parallel have become a new trend, thereby presenting significant challenges and opportunities for the integration of multiple tasks within the domain of 3D vision. The limitations of 3D data acquisition conditions have not only restricted the exploration of many innovative research problems but have also caused existing 3D datasets to predominantly focus on single tasks. This has resulted in a lack of systematic approaches and theoretical frameworks for 3D multi-task learning, with most efforts merely serving as auxiliary support to the primary task. In this paper, we introduce WHU-Synthetic, a large-scale 3D synthetic perception dataset designed for multi-task learning, from the initial data augmentation (upsampling and depth completion), through scene understanding (segmentation), to macro-level tasks (place recognition and 3D reconstruction). Collected in the same environmental domain, we ensure inherent alignment across sub-tasks to construct multi-task models without separate training methods. Besides, we implement several novel settings, making it possible to realize certain ideas that are difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios. This supports more adaptive and robust multi-task perception tasks, such as sampling on city-level models, providing point clouds with different densities, and simulating temporal changes. Using our dataset, we conduct several experiments to investigate mutual benefits between sub-tasks, revealing new observations, challenges, and opportunities for future research.

<p>Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but their high computational complexity limits their application in high-resolution image processing and long-context analysis. This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

<p>Abstract: Fast and accurate depth sensing has long been a significant research challenge. Event camera, as a device that quickly responds to intensity changes, provides a new solution for structured light (SL) systems. In this paper, we introduce Gray code into event-based SL systems for the first time. Our setup includes an event camera and a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, enabling depth estimation through high-speed projection and decoding of Gray code patterns. By employing Gray code for point matching in event-based SL system, our method is immune to timestamp noise, realizing high-speed depth estimation without loss of accuracy and spatial resolution. The binary nature of events and Gray code minimizes data redundancy, enabling us to fully utilize sensor bandwidth at 100%. Experimental results show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art scanning methods while surpassing them in data acquisition speed (up to 41 times improvement) without sacrificing accuracy and spatial resolution. Our proposed approach offers a highly promising solution for ultra-fast, real-time, and high-precision dense depth estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in view synthesis and real-time rendering have achieved photorealistic quality at impressive rendering speeds. While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Single-view 3D reconstruction is currently approached from two dominant perspectives: reconstruction of scenes with limited diversity using 3D data supervision or reconstruction of diverse singular objects using large image priors. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and exceed the capabilities of these methods. We therefore propose a hybrid method following a divide-and-conquer strategy. We first process the scene holistically, extracting depth and semantic information, and then leverage an object-level method for the detailed reconstruction of individual components. By splitting the problem into simpler tasks, our system is able to generalize to various types of scenes without retraining or fine-tuning. We purposely design our pipeline to be highly modular with independent, self-contained modules, to avoid the need for end-to-end training of the whole system. This enables the pipeline to naturally improve as future methods can replace the individual modules. We demonstrate the reconstruction performance of our approach on both synthetic and real-world scenes, comparing favorable against prior works.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MultiBooth, a novel and efficient technique for multi-concept customization in image generation from text. Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Aich, Yumin Suh, Samuel Schulter, Manmohan Chandraker</p>
<p>Abstract: A powerful architecture for universal segmentation relies on transformers that encode multi-scale image features and decode object queries into mask predictions. With efficiency being a high priority for scaling such models, we observed that the state-of-the-art method Mask2Former uses 50% of its compute only on the transformer encoder. This is due to the retention of a full-length token-level representation of all backbone feature scales at each encoder layer. With this observation, we propose a strategy termed PROgressive Token Length SCALing for Efficient transformer encoders (PRO-SCALE) that can be plugged-in to the Mask2Former segmentation architecture to significantly reduce the computational cost. The underlying principle of PRO-SCALE is: progressively scale the length of the tokens with the layers of the encoder. This allows PRO-SCALE to reduce computations by a large margin with minimal sacrifice in performance (~52% encoder and ~27% overall GFLOPs reduction with no drop in performance on COCO dataset). Experiments conducted on public benchmarks demonstrates PRO-SCALE's flexibility in architectural configurations, and exhibits potential for extension beyond the settings of segmentation tasks to encompass object detection.

<p>Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging learned holography approaches have enabled faster and high-quality hologram synthesis, setting a new milestone toward practical holographic displays. However, these learned models require training a dedicated model for each set of display-scene parameters. To address this shortcoming, our work introduces a highly configurable learned model structure, synthesizing 3D holograms interactively while supporting diverse display-scene parameters. Our family of models relying on this structure can be conditioned continuously for varying novel scene parameters, including input images, propagation distances, volume depths, peak brightnesses, and novel display parameters of pixel pitches and wavelengths. Uniquely, our findings unearth a correlation between depth estimation and hologram synthesis tasks in the learning domain, leading to a learned model that unlocks accurate 3D hologram generation from 2D images across varied display-scene parameters. We validate our models by synthesizing high-quality 3D holograms in simulations and also verify our findings with two different holographic display prototypes. Moreover, our family of models can synthesize holograms with a 2x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art learned holography approaches in the literature.</p>

Yet, none asks the fundamental question: \textit{What digital manipulations make a real photographic face image fake, while others do not?} In this paper, we put face forgery in a semantic context and define that \textit{computational methods that alter semantic face attributes to exceed human discrimination thresholds are sources of face forgery}. Following our definition, we construct a large face forgery image dataset, where each image is associated with a set of labels organized in a hierarchical graph. Our dataset enables two new testing protocols to probe the generalizability of face forgery detectors. Moreover, we propose a semantics-oriented face forgery detection method that captures label relations and prioritizes the primary task (\ie, real or fake face detection). We show that the proposed dataset successfully exposes the weaknesses of current detectors as the test set and consistently improves their generalizability as the training set. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our semantics-oriented method over traditional binary and multi-class classification-based detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nisha L. Raichur, Lucas Heublein, Tobias Feigl, Alexander R\"ugamer, Christopher Mutschler, Felix Ott</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary objective of methods in continual learning is to learn tasks in a sequential manner over time (sometimes from a stream of data), while mitigating the detrimental phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes a method to learn an effective representation between previous and newly encountered class prototypes. We propose a prototypical network with a Bayesian learning-driven contrastive loss (BLCL), tailored specifically for class-incremental learning scenarios. We introduce a contrastive loss that incorporates novel classes into the latent representation by reducing intra-class and increasing inter-class distance. Our approach dynamically adapts the balance between the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions with a Bayesian learning technique. Experimental results conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet100 datasets for image classification and images of a GNSS-based dataset for interference classification validate the efficacy of our method, showcasing its superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhang Liu, Zhecan Wang, Hammad Ayyubi, Haoxuan You, Chris Thomas, Rui Sun, Shih-Fu Chang, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Vision-Language Understanding (VLU) benchmarks such as VQA v2, OKVQA, A-OKVQA, GQA, VCR, SWAG, and VisualCOMET, our analysis reveals a pervasive issue affecting their integrity: these benchmarks contain samples where answers rely on assumptions unsupported by the provided context. Training models on such data foster biased learning and hallucinations as models tend to make similar unwarranted assumptions. To address this issue, we collect contextual data for each sample whenever available and train a context selection module to facilitate evidence-based model predictions. Strong improvements across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further, we develop a general-purpose Context-AwaRe Abstention (CARA) detector to identify samples lacking sufficient context and enhance model accuracy by abstaining from responding if the required context is absent. CARA exhibits generalization to new benchmarks it wasn't trained on, underscoring its utility for future VLU benchmarks in detecting or cleaning samples with inadequate context. Finally, we curate a Context Ambiguity and Sufficiency Evaluation (CASE) set to benchmark the performance of insufficient context detectors. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in ensuring that vision-language models generate trustworthy and evidence-based outputs in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyeon Na, Yonggyu Kim, Hyunjoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Human image generation is a key focus in image synthesis due to its broad applications, but even slight inaccuracies in anatomy, pose, or details can compromise realism. To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights the practical value of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Wei, Osman \"Ulger, Fatemeh Karimi Nejadasl, Theo Gevers, Martin R. Oswald</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods offer promising capabilities in detecting unseen object categories, but the category must be known and needs to be provided by a human, either via a text prompt or pre-labeled datasets, thus limiting their scalability. We propose 3D-AVS, a method for Auto-Vocabulary Segmentation of 3D point clouds for which the vocabulary is unknown and auto-generated for each input at runtime, thus eliminating the human in the loop and typically providing a substantially larger vocabulary for richer annotations. 3D-AVS first recognizes semantic entities from image or point cloud data and then segments all points with the automatically generated vocabulary. Our method incorporates both image-based and point-based recognition, enhancing robustness under challenging lighting conditions where geometric information from LiDAR is especially valuable. Our point-based recognition features a Sparse Masked Attention Pooling (SMAP) module to enrich the diversity of recognized objects. To address the challenges of evaluating unknown vocabularies and avoid annotation biases from label synonyms, hierarchies, or semantic overlaps, we introduce the annotation-free Text-Point Semantic Similarity (TPSS) metric for assessing generated vocabulary quality. Our evaluations on nuScenes and ScanNet200 demonstrate 3D-AVS's ability to generate semantic classes with accurate point-wise segmentations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshana Saravanan, Varun Gupta, Darshan Singh, Zeeshan Khan, Vineet Gandhi, Makarand Tapaswi</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental aspect of compositional reasoning in a video is associating people and their actions across time. Recent years have seen great progress in general-purpose vision or video models and a move towards long-video understanding. While exciting, we take a step back and ask: are current models good at compositional reasoning on short videos? To this end, we introduce VELOCITI, a benchmark to study Video-LLMs by disentangling and assessing the comprehension of agents, actions, and their associations across multiple events. We adopt the Video-Language Entailment setup and propose StrictVLE that requires correct classification (rather than ranking) of the positive and negative caption. We evaluate several models and observe that even the best, LLaVA-OneVision (44.5%) and Gemini-1.5-Pro (49.3%), are far from human accuracy at 93.0%. Results show that action understanding lags behind agents, and negative captions created using entities appearing in the video perform worse than those obtained from pure text manipulation. We also present challenges with ClassicVLE and multiple-choice (MC) evaluation, strengthening our preference for StrictVLE. Finally, we validate that our benchmark requires visual inputs of multiple frames making it ideal to study video-language compositional reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a novel architecture that integrates the learnable spline-based activation functions of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into convolutional layers. By replacing traditional fixed-weight kernels with learnable non-linear functions, Convolutional KANs offer a significant improvement in parameter efficiency and expressive power over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We empirically evaluate Convolutional KANs on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, demonstrating competitive accuracy with up to 50% fewer parameters compared to baseline classic convolutions. This suggests that the KAN Convolution can effectively capture complex spatial relationships with fewer resources, offering a promising alternative for parameter-efficient deep learning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of novel view audio-visual synthesis along an arbitrary trajectory in an indoor scene, given the audio-video recordings from other known trajectories of the scene. Existing methods often overlook the effect of room geometry, particularly wall occlusions on sound propagation, making them less accurate in multi-room environments. In this work, we propose a new approach called Scene Occlusion-aware Acoustic Field (SOAF) for accurate sound generation. Our approach derives a global prior for the sound field using distance-aware parametric sound-propagation modeling and then transforms it based on the scene structure learned from the input video. We extract features from the local acoustic field centered at the receiver using a Fibonacci Sphere to generate binaural audio for novel views with a direction-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the real dataset RWAVS and the synthetic dataset SoundSpaces demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in audio generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wojciech Zielonka, Timo Bolkart, Thabo Beeler, Justus Thies</p>
<p>Abstract: Current personalized neural head avatars face a trade-off: lightweight models lack detail and realism, while high-quality, animatable avatars require significant computational resources, making them unsuitable for commodity devices. To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), which provide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEM utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined with Gaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3D morphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbases for representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, we construct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacity of the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitives of a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, only requiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respective coefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distilling high-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generate expression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles. These high-quality models are trained on multi-view videos of a subject and are distilled using a series of principal component analyses. Once we have obtained the bases that represent the animatable appearance space of a specific human, we learn a regressor that takes a single RGB image as input and predicts the low-dimensional parameter vector that corresponds to the shown facial expression. In a series of experiments, we compare GEM's self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment results to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating GEM's higher visual quality and better generalization to new expressions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Pengyu Liu, Dan Guo, Fei Wang, Zhiliang Wu, Hehe Fan, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Shaker, Syed Talal Wasim, Salman Khan, Juergen Gall, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies with subquadratic computational complexity, making them attractive for various applications. However, purely SSM-based models face critical challenges related to stability and achieving state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. We introduce a parameter-efficient modulated group mamba layer that divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

<p>Abstract: Event cameras have the ability to capture asynchronous per-pixel brightness changes, called "events", offering advantages over traditional frame-based cameras for computer vision applications. Efficiently coding event data is critical for transmission and storage, given the significant volume of events. This paper proposes a novel double deep learning-based architecture for both event data coding and classification, using a point cloud-based representation for events. In this context, the conversions from events to point clouds and back to events are key steps in the proposed solution, and therefore its impact is evaluated in terms of compression and classification performance. Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve a classification performance of compressed events which is similar to one of the original events, even after applying a lossy point cloud codec, notably the recent learning-based JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding standard, with a clear rate reduction. Experimental results also demonstrate that events coded using JPEG PCC achieve better classification performance than those coded using the conventional lossy MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Coding standard. Furthermore, the adoption of learning-based coding offers high potential for performing computer vision tasks in the compressed domain, which allows skipping the decoding stage while mitigating the impact of coding artifacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of low-level vision tasks but also increased the difficulty of interpretability. A deep understanding of deep models is beneficial for both network design and practical reliability. To take up this challenge, we introduce causality theory to interpret low-level vision models and propose a model-/task-agnostic method called Causal Effect Map (CEM). With CEM, we can visualize and quantify the input-output relationships on either positive or negative effects. After analyzing various low-level vision tasks with CEM, we have reached several interesting insights, such as: (1) Using more information of input images (e.g., larger receptive field) does NOT always yield positive outcomes. (2) Attempting to incorporate mechanisms with a global receptive field (e.g., channel attention) into image denoising may prove futile. (3) Integrating multiple tasks to train a general model could encourage the network to prioritize local information over global context. Based on the causal effect theory, the proposed diagnostic tool can refresh our common knowledge and bring a deeper understanding of low-level vision models.

<p>Abstract: The goal of image cropping is to identify visually appealing crops in an image. Conventional methods are trained on specific datasets and fail to adapt to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, downstream tasks with VLMs remain under explored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, we refer to as Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Liang, Shilei Cao, Xiucheng Zhang, Juepeng Zheng, Jianxi Huang, Haohuan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation. By effectively combining these losses, LSCD-TTA enables rapid and accurate adaptation to the target domain for RS image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umaima Rahman, Raza Imam, Mohammad Yaqub, Boulbaba Ben Amor, Dwarikanath Mahapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image classification, supervised learning is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled medical images. To address this, we leverage the visual-textual alignment within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable unsupervised learning of a medical image classifier. In this work, we propose \underline{Med}ical \underline{Un}supervised \underline{A}daptation (\texttt{MedUnA}) of VLMs, where the LLM-generated descriptions for each class are encoded into text embeddings and matched with class labels via a cross-modal adapter. This adapter attaches to a visual encoder of \texttt{MedCLIP} and aligns the visual embeddings through unsupervised learning, driven by a contrastive entropy-based loss and prompt tuning. Thereby, improving performance in scenarios where textual information is more abundant than labeled images, particularly in the healthcare domain. Unlike traditional VLMs, \texttt{MedUnA} uses \textbf{unpaired images and text} for learning representations and enhances the potential of VLMs beyond traditional constraints. We evaluate the performance on three chest X-ray datasets and two multi-class datasets (diabetic retinopathy and skin lesions), showing significant accuracy gains over the zero-shot baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mengxi Zhou, Nastaran Karimi Monsefi, Ser-Nam Lim, Wei-Lun Chao, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach that significantly enhances its efficacy for pre-training. Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures copyright of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion. Our method achieves superior performance in both rendering quality and watermark robustness while improving real-time rendering efficiency. Project page: https://kuai-lab.github.io/cvpr20253dgsw/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhui Diao, Haichen Yu, Kaiyue Kang, Tong Ling, Di Liu, Yingchao Feng, Hanbo Bi, Libo Ren, Xuexue Li, Yongqiang Mao, Xian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial Remote Sensing (ARS) vision tasks pose significant challenges due to the unique characteristics of their viewing angles. Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and efficacy of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Sprintson, Rama Chellappa, Cheng Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FusionRF, a novel framework for digital surface reconstruction from satellite multispectral and panchromatic images. Current work has demonstrated the increased accuracy of neural photogrammetry for surface reconstruction from optical satellite images compared to algorithmic methods. Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% improvement in depth reconstruction accuracy, and renders sharp training and novel views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsu Yoo, Zhenyang Feng, Tai-Yu Pan, Yihong Sun, Cheng Perng Phoo, Xiangyu Chen, Mark Campbell, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Bharath Hariharan, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection in real-world environments requires a huge amount of annotated data with high quality. Acquiring such data is tedious and expensive, and often needs repeated effort when a new sensor is adopted or when the detector is deployed in a new environment. We investigate a new scenario to construct 3D object detectors: learning from the predictions of a nearby unit that is equipped with an accurate detector. For example, when a self-driving car enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose detectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient, sensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share the predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car). Naively using the received predictions as ground-truths to train the detector for the ego car, however, leads to inferior performance. We systematically study the problem and identify viewpoint mismatches and mislocalization (due to synchronization and GPS errors) as the main causes, which unavoidably result in false positives, false negatives, and inaccurate pseudo labels. We propose a distance-based curriculum, first learning from closer units with similar viewpoints and subsequently improving the quality of other units' predictions via self-training. We further demonstrate that an effective pseudo label refinement module can be trained with a handful of annotated data, largely reducing the data quantity necessary to train an object detector. We validate our approach on the recently released real-world collaborative driving dataset, using reference cars' predictions as pseudo labels for the ego car. Extensive experiments including several scenarios (e.g., different sensors, detectors, and domains) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach toward label-efficient learning of 3D perception from other units' predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Tang, Lu Qi, Fei Xie, Xiangtai Li, Chao Ma, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video prediction has witnessed the emergence of RNN-based models led by ConvLSTM, and CNN-based models led by SimVP. Following the significant success of ViT, recent works have integrated ViT into both RNN and CNN frameworks, achieving improved performance. While we appreciate these prior approaches, we raise a fundamental question: Is there a simpler yet more effective solution that can eliminate the high computational cost of RNNs while addressing the limited receptive fields and poor generalization of CNNs? How far can it go with a simple pure transformer model for video prediction? In this paper, we propose PredFormer, a framework entirely based on Gated Transformers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 3D Attention in the context of video prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PredFormer delivers state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks. The significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency highlight the potential of PredFormer as a strong baseline for real-world video prediction applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyi Guo, Yuyang Liu, Zhiyuan Yan, Zongying Lin, Peixi Peng, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental object detection is fundamentally challenged by catastrophic forgetting. A major factor contributing to this issue is background shift, where background categories in sequential tasks may overlap with either previously learned or future unseen classes. To address this, we propose a novel method called Class-Agnostic Shared Attribute Base (CASA) that encourages the model to learn category-agnostic attributes shared across incremental classes. Our approach leverages an LLM to generate candidate textual attributes, selects the most relevant ones based on the current training data, and records their importance in an assignment matrix. For subsequent tasks, the retained attributes are frozen, and new attributes are selected from the remaining candidates, ensuring both knowledge retention and adaptability. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhao, Mingjia Li, Qiming Hu, Xiaojie Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent deep-learning-based approaches to single-image reflection removal have shown promising advances, primarily for two reasons: 1) the utilization of recognition-pretrained features as inputs, and 2) the design of dual-stream interaction networks. However, according to the Information Bottleneck principle, high-level semantic clues tend to be compressed or discarded during layer-by-layer propagation. Additionally, interactions in dual-stream networks follow a fixed pattern across different layers, limiting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Reversible Decoupling Network (RDNet), which employs a reversible encoder to secure valuable information while flexibly decoupling transmission- and reflection-relevant features during the forward pass. Furthermore, we customize a transmission-rate-aware prompt generator to dynamically calibrate features, further boosting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RDNet over existing SOTA methods on five widely-adopted benchmark datasets. RDNet achieves the best performance in the NTIRE 2025 Single Image Reflection Removal in the Wild Challenge in both fidelity and perceptual comparison.

We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Shi Qiu, Yiyang Zhou, Zhaoyang Wang, Wenhao Zheng, Zhaorun Chen, Chenhang Cui, Mingyu Ding, Linjie Li, Lijuan Wang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujian Zhao, Chengru Wu, Yinong Xu, Xuanzheng Du, Ruiyu Li, Guanglin Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID), also known as Long-Term Person Re-Identification (LT-ReID) is a critical and challenging research topic in computer vision that has recently garnered significant attention. However, due to the high cost of constructing CC-ReID data, the existing data-driven models are hard to train efficiently on limited data, causing overfitting issue. To address this challenge, we propose a low-cost and efficient pipeline for generating controllable and high-quality synthetic data simulating the surveillance of real scenarios specific to the CC-ReID task. Particularly, we construct a new self-annotated CC-ReID dataset named Cloth-Changing Unreal Person (CCUP), containing 6,000 IDs, 1,179,976 images, 100 cameras, and 26.5 outfits per individual. Based on this large-scale dataset, we introduce an effective and scalable pretrain-finetune framework for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the traditional CC-ReID models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that two typical models namely TransReID and FIRe^2, when integrated into our framework, outperform other state-of-the-art models after pretraining on CCUP and finetuning on the benchmarks such as PRCC, VC-Clothes and NKUP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhi Zhang, Zizhang Li, Matt Zhou, Shangzhe Wu, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Scene Language, a visual scene representation that concisely and precisely describes the structure, semantics, and identity of visual scenes. It represents a scene with three key components: a program that specifies the hierarchical and relational structure of entities in the scene, words in natural language that summarize the semantic class of each entity, and embeddings that capture the visual identity of each entity. This representation can be inferred from pre-trained language models via a training-free inference technique, given text or image inputs. The resulting scene can be rendered into images using traditional, neural, or hybrid graphics renderers. Together, this forms a robust, automated system for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation. Compared with existing representations like scene graphs, our proposed Scene Language generates complex scenes with higher fidelity, while explicitly modeling the scene structures to enable precise control and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wang, Zekai Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Samir Khaki, Ahmad Sajedi, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Konstantinos N Plataniotis, Alexander Hauptmann, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in more complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns. Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets. Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD. Our code and benchmark will be made public at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, a robust method for 3D pose estimation of immature green apples (fruitlets) in commercial orchards was developed, utilizing the YOLO11(or YOLOv11) object detection and pose estimation algorithm alongside Vision Transformers (ViT) for depth estimation (Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) and Depth Anything V2). For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Chaubey, Anoubhav Agarwaal, Sartaki Sinha Roy, Aayush Agrawal, Susmita Ghose</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual advertising serves ads that are aligned to the content that the user is viewing. The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinnan Chen, Chen Li, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DiHuR, a novel Diffusion-guided model for generalizable Human 3D Reconstruction and view synthesis from sparse, minimally overlapping images. While existing generalizable human radiance fields excel at novel view synthesis, they often struggle with comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Similarly, directly optimizing implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) fields from sparse-view images typically yields poor results due to limited overlap. To enhance 3D reconstruction quality, we propose using learnable tokens associated with SMPL vertices to aggregate sparse view features and then to guide SDF prediction. These tokens learn a generalizable prior across different identities in training datasets, leveraging the consistent projection of SMPL vertices onto similar semantic areas across various human identities. This consistency enables effective knowledge transfer to unseen identities during inference. Recognizing SMPL's limitations in capturing clothing details, we incorporate a diffusion model as an additional prior to fill in missing information, particularly for complex clothing geometries. Our method integrates two key priors in a coherent manner: the prior from generalizable feed-forward models and the 2D diffusion prior, and it requires only multi-view image training, without 3D supervision. DiHuR demonstrates superior performance in both within-dataset and cross-dataset generalization settings, as validated on THuman, ZJU-MoCap, and HuMMan datasets compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective training of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained client devices in Federated Learning (FL) requires the usage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. To this end, we demonstrate the impact of two factors \textit{viz.}, client-specific layer importance score that selects the most important VLM layers for fine-tuning and inter-client layer diversity score that encourages diverse layer selection across clients for optimal VLM layer selection. We first theoretically motivate and leverage the principal eigenvalue magnitude of layerwise Neural Tangent Kernels and show its effectiveness as client-specific layer importance score. Next, we propose a novel layer updating strategy dubbed F$^3$OCUS that jointly optimizes the layer importance and diversity factors by employing a data-free, multi-objective, meta-heuristic optimization on the server. We explore 5 different meta-heuristic algorithms and compare their effectiveness for selecting model layers and adapter layers towards PEFT-FL. Furthermore, we release a new MedVQA-FL dataset involving overall 707,962 VQA triplets and 9 modality-specific clients and utilize it to train and evaluate our method. Overall, we conduct more than 10,000 client-level experiments on 6 Vision-Language FL task settings involving 58 medical image datasets and 4 different VLM architectures of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to synthesize personalized group photos and specify the positions of each identity offers immense creative potential. While such imagery can be visually appealing, it presents significant challenges for existing technologies. A persistent issue is identity (ID) leakage, where injected facial features interfere with one another, resulting in low face resemblance, incorrect positioning, and visual artifacts. Existing methods suffer from limitations such as the reliance on segmentation models, increased runtime, or a high probability of ID leakage. To address these challenges, we propose ID-Patch, a novel method that provides robust association between identities and 2D positions. Our approach generates an ID patch and ID embeddings from the same facial features: the ID patch is positioned on the conditional image for precise spatial control, while the ID embeddings integrate with text embeddings to ensure high resemblance. Experimental results demonstrate that ID-Patch surpasses baseline methods across metrics, such as face ID resemblance, ID-position association accuracy, and generation efficiency.

But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Wu, Mingyu Liu, Zeyu Zhu, Xi Xia, Haoen Feng, Wen Wang, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Chunhua Shen, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation models, like Stable Video Diffusion, show promising results, but primarily focus on short, single-scene videos. These models struggle with generating long videos that involve multiple scenes, coherent narratives, and consistent characters. Furthermore, there is no publicly available dataset tailored for the analysis, evaluation, and training of long video generation models. In this paper, we present MovieBench: A Hierarchical Movie-Level Dataset for Long Video Generation, which addresses these challenges by providing unique contributions: (1) movie-length videos featuring rich, coherent storylines and multi-scene narratives, (2) consistency of character appearance and audio across scenes, and (3) hierarchical data structure contains high-level movie information and detailed shot-level descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that MovieBench brings some new insights and challenges, such as maintaining character ID consistency across multiple scenes for various characters. The dataset will be public and continuously maintained, aiming to advance the field of long video generation. Data can be found at: https://weijiawu.github.io/MovieBench/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengfan Zhou, Bangjie Yin, Hefei Ling, Qianyu Zhou, Wenxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that subtly manipulate benign face images, underscoring the urgent need to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks in order to expose the blind spots of these systems. Existing adversarial attack methods often overlook the potential benefits of augmenting the surrogate model with diverse initializations, which limits the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address this gap, we propose a novel method called Diverse Parameters Augmentation (DPA) attack method, which enhances surrogate models by incorporating diverse parameter initializations, resulting in a broader and more diverse set of surrogate models. Specifically, DPA consists of two key stages: Diverse Parameters Optimization (DPO) and Hard Model Aggregation (HMA). In the DPO stage, we initialize the parameters of the surrogate model using both pre-trained and random parameters. Subsequently, we save the models in the intermediate training process to obtain a diverse set of surrogate models. During the HMA stage, we enhance the feature maps of the diversified surrogate models by incorporating beneficial perturbations, thereby further improving the transferability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attack method can effectively enhance the transferability of the crafted adversarial face examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-based image editing aims to modify specific image elements with natural language instructions. However, current models in this domain often struggle to accurately execute complex user instructions, as they are trained on low-quality data with limited editing types. We present AnyEdit, a comprehensive multi-modal instruction editing dataset, comprising 2.5 million high-quality editing pairs spanning over 20 editing types and five domains. We ensure the diversity and quality of the AnyEdit collection through three aspects: initial data diversity, adaptive editing process, and automated selection of editing results. Using the dataset, we further train a novel AnyEdit Stable Diffusion with task-aware routing and learnable task embedding for unified image editing. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that AnyEdit consistently boosts the performance of diffusion-based editing models. This presents prospects for developing instruction-driven image editing models that support human creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Hyeok Jung, Eun Tae Kim, Seoyeon Kim, Joo Ho Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Buru Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) act as essential interfaces, connecting humans with AI technologies in multimodal applications. However, current MLLMs face challenges in accurately interpreting object orientation in images due to inconsistent orientation annotations in training data, hindering the development of a coherent orientation understanding. To overcome this, we propose egocentric instruction tuning, which aligns MLLMs' orientation understanding with the user's perspective, based on a consistent annotation standard derived from the user's egocentric viewpoint. We first generate egocentric instruction data that leverages MLLMs' ability to recognize object details and applies prior knowledge for orientation understanding. Using this data, we perform instruction tuning to enhance the model's capability for accurate orientation interpretation. In addition, we introduce EgoOrientBench, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' orientation understanding across three tasks using images collected from diverse domains. Experimental results on this benchmark show that egocentric instruction tuning significantly improves orientation understanding without compromising overall MLLM performance. The instruction data and benchmark dataset are available on our project page at https://github.com/jhCOR/EgoOrientBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Li, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose plays a crucial role in the digital age. While recent works have achieved impressive progress in understanding and generating human poses, they often support only a single modality of control signals and operate in isolation, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. This paper presents UniPose, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit human poses across various modalities, including images, text, and 3D SMPL poses. Specifically, we apply a pose tokenizer to convert 3D poses into discrete pose tokens, enabling seamless integration into the LLM within a unified vocabulary. To further enhance the fine-grained pose perception capabilities, we facilitate UniPose with a mixture of visual encoders, among them a pose-specific visual encoder. Benefiting from a unified learning strategy, UniPose effectively transfers knowledge across different pose-relevant tasks, adapts to unseen tasks, and exhibits extended capabilities. This work serves as the first attempt at building a general-purpose framework for pose comprehension, generation, and editing. Extensive experiments highlight UniPose's competitive and even superior performance across various pose-relevant tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present BootComp, a novel framework based on text-to-image diffusion models for controllable human image generation with multiple reference garments. Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyu Yang, Yaxiong Wang, Li Zhu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based person search aims to retrieve specific individuals across camera networks using natural language descriptions. However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios. To meet such demands, we propose a new task, text-based person anomaly search, locating pedestrians engaged in both routine or anomalous activities via text. To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval, and the proposed pose-aware method arrives at 84.93% recall@1 accuracy, surpassing other competitive methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trong-Thuan Nguyen, Pha Nguyen, Jackson Cothren, Alper Yilmaz, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs have advanced vision-language tasks but still struggle with understanding video scenes. To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames. However, prior methods rely on pairwise connections, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-object interactions and reasoning. To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linwei Dong, Qingnan Fan, Yihong Guo, Zhonghao Wang, Qi Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Yawei Luo, Changqing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding and generation tasks. However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to limitations in data size and diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenING, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82.42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement. Key findings on interleaved image-text generation are further presented to guide the development of next-generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Karageorgiou, Symeon Papadopoulos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris, Efstratios Gavves</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yawen Shao, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Hongchen Luo, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary 3D object affordance grounding aims to anticipate ``action possibilities'' regions on 3D objects with arbitrary instructions, which is crucial for robots to generically perceive real scenarios and respond to operational changes. Existing methods focus on combining images or languages that depict interactions with 3D geometries to introduce external interaction priors. However, they are still vulnerable to a limited semantic space by failing to leverage implied invariant geometries and potential interaction intentions. Normally, humans address complex tasks through multi-step reasoning and respond to diverse situations by leveraging associative and analogical thinking. In light of this, we propose GREAT (GeometRy-intEntion collAboraTive inference) for Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Affordance Grounding, a novel framework that mines the object invariant geometry attributes and performs analogically reason in potential interaction scenarios to form affordance knowledge, fully combining the knowledge with both geometries and visual contents to ground 3D object affordance. Besides, we introduce the Point Image Affordance Dataset v2 (PIADv2), the largest 3D object affordance dataset at present to support the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of GREAT. The code and dataset are available at https://yawen-shao.github.io/GREAT/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yogesh Kulkarni, Pooyan Fazli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video-large language models (Video-LLMs) have led to significant progress in video understanding. Current preference optimization methods often rely on proprietary APIs or ground-truth captions to generate preference data (i.e., pairs of model outputs ranked based on their quality or alignment with human judgment), which is then used to train models for video-language alignment. This approach is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce VideoSAVi (Self-Aligned Video Language Model), a self-training pipeline that enables Video-LLMs to reason over video content without external supervision. Our approach includes a self-critiquing mechanism that identifies reasoning errors in the model's initial responses and generates improved alternatives, creating preference pairs directly from video content. VideoSAVi then applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uses the preference data to iteratively train the model, enhancing temporal and spatial reasoning in video understanding. Experiments show that VideoSAVi achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVBench (74.0%) and delivers significant improvements across other benchmarks, including a 3.9% gain on PerceptionTest and a substantial 6.8% improvement on the challenging EgoSchema dataset compared to baseline models. Our model-agnostic approach is computationally efficient, requiring only 32 frames, offering a promising direction for self-aligned video understanding without reliance on external models or annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Presto, a novel video diffusion model designed to generate 15-second videos with long-range coherence and rich content. Extending video generation methods to maintain scenario diversity over long durations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a Segmented Cross-Attention (SCA) strategy, which splits hidden states into segments along the temporal dimension, allowing each segment to cross-attend to a corresponding sub-caption. SCA requires no additional parameters, enabling seamless incorporation into current DiT-based architectures. To facilitate high-quality long video generation, we build the LongTake-HD dataset, consisting of 261k content-rich videos with scenario coherence, annotated with an overall video caption and five progressive sub-captions. Experiments show that our Presto achieves 78.5% on the VBench Semantic Score and 100% on the Dynamic Degree, outperforming existing state-of-the-art video generation methods. This demonstrates that our proposed Presto significantly enhances content richness, maintains long-range coherence, and captures intricate textual details.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinayak Gupta, Yunze Man, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized 2D and 3D content creation, yet generating photorealistic dynamic 4D scenes remains a significant challenge. Existing dynamic 4D generation methods typically rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, often fine-tuned on synthetic object datasets. Consequently, the resulting scenes tend to be object-centric and lack photorealism. While text-to-video models can generate more realistic scenes with motion, they often struggle with spatial understanding and provide limited control over camera viewpoints during rendering. To address these limitations, we present PaintScene4D, a novel text-to-4D scene generation framework that departs from conventional multi-view generative models in favor of a streamlined architecture that harnesses video generative models trained on diverse real-world datasets. Our method first generates a reference video using a video generation model, and then employs a strategic camera array selection for rendering. We apply a progressive warping and inpainting technique to ensure both spatial and temporal consistency across multiple viewpoints. Finally, we optimize multi-view images using a dynamic renderer, enabling flexible camera control based on user preferences. Adopting a training-free architecture, our PaintScene4D efficiently produces realistic 4D scenes that can be viewed from arbitrary trajectories. The code will be made publicly available.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilan Wang, Junfeng Guo, Jiacheng Zhu, Yiming Li, Heng Huang, Muhao Chen, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled a variety of downstream applications, including style customization, subject-driven personalization, and conditional generation. As T2I models require extensive data and computational resources for training, they constitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate owners, yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by adversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized, usually profitable applications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally involve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through generated outputs examination, or inspecting the model's feature space. However, these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios when the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning, and the feature space is inaccessible during verification ((i.e., black-box setting). The model is prone to forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a new task. To address this challenge, we propose SleeperMark, a novel framework designed to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark explicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the semantic concepts it learns, allowing the model to retain the embedded watermark while continuing to be adapted to new downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types of diffusion models, including latent diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and pixel diffusion models (e.g., DeepFloyd-IF), showing robustness against downstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels, with minimal impact on the model's generative capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Wang, Ouxiang Li, Tingting Mu, Yanbin Hao, Kuien Liu, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent success of text-to-image (T2I) generation and its increasing practical applications, enabled by diffusion models, require urgent consideration of erasing unwanted concepts, e.g., copyrighted, offensive, and unsafe ones, from the pre-trained models in a precise, timely, and low-cost manner. The twofold demand of concept erasure includes not only a precise removal of the target concept (i.e., erasure efficacy) but also a minimal change on non-target content (i.e., prior preservation), during generation. Existing methods face challenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and prior preservation, and they can be computationally costly. To improve, we propose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive Value Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. Our method is grounded in a classical linear algebraic operation of computing the orthogonal complement, implemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of diffusion models. We design a shift factor to adaptively navigate the erasure strength, enhancing effective prior preservation without sacrificing erasure efficacy. Extensive comparative experiments with both training-based and training-free state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed AdaVD excels in both single and multiple concept erasure, showing 2 to 10 times improvement in prior preservation than the second best, meanwhile achieving the best or near best erasure efficacy. AdaVD supports a series of diffusion models and downstream image generation tasks, with code available on: https://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marsha Mariya Kappan, Eduardo Benitez Sandoval, Erik Meijering, Francisco Cruz</p>
<p>Abstract: Pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision with a wide range of applications from activity monitoring to human-robot interaction. However,most of the existing methods are computationally expensive or have complex architecture. Here we propose a lightweight attention based pose estimation network that utilizes depthwise separable convolution and Convolutional Block Attention Module on an hourglass backbone. The network significantly reduces the computational complexity (floating point operations) and the model size (number of parameters) containing only about 10% of parameters of original eight stack Hourglass network. Experiments were conducted on COCO and MPII datasets using a two stack hourglass backbone. The results showed that our model performs well in comparison to six other lightweight pose estimation models with an average precision of 72.07. The model achieves this performance with only 2.3M parameters and 3.7G FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Luo, Mir Rayat Imtiaz Hossain, Boyang Li, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) implicitly learn to associate image regions with words from large-scale training data, demonstrating an emergent capability for grounding concepts without dense annotations[14,18,51]. However, the coarse-grained supervision from image-caption pairs is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities in object-concept correspondence, even with enormous data volume. Rich semantic and syntactic structures within the text modality have been overlooked as sources of supervision. Starting from contrastive architectures (BLIP and ALBEF) that show strong intrinsic grounding abilities, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST). HIST enhances spatial vision-language alignment without using additional human annotations, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subjects, Phrases, and Composite Phrases, and enforcing entailment relation between a parent and its children in the hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of the corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Composition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed. Compared to baseline VLMs, HIST achieves up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding and +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation. Surprisingly, the improved spatial grounding leads to improvements in other downstream VLM tasks: +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Liu, Zhiding Yu, Shiyi Lan, Shihao Wang, Rongyao Fang, Jan Kautz, Hongsheng Li, Jose M. Alvare</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents StreamChat, a novel approach that enhances the interaction capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with streaming video content. In streaming interaction scenarios, existing methods rely solely on visual information available at the moment a question is posed, resulting in significant delays as the model remains unaware of subsequent changes in the streaming video. StreamChat addresses this limitation by innovatively updating the visual context at each decoding step, ensuring that the model utilizes up-to-date video content throughout the decoding process. Additionally, we introduce a flexible and efficient crossattention-based architecture to process dynamic streaming inputs while maintaining inference efficiency for streaming interactions. Furthermore, we construct a new dense instruction dataset to facilitate the training of streaming interaction models, complemented by a parallel 3D-RoPE mechanism that encodes the relative temporal information of visual and text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamChat achieves competitive performance on established image and video benchmarks and exhibits superior capabilities in streaming interaction scenarios compared to state-of-the-art video LMM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Huang, Wangbo Yu, Xinhua Cheng, ChengShu Zhao, Yunyang Ge, Mingyi Guo, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor scene texture synthesis has garnered significant interest due to its important potential applications in virtual reality, digital media and creative arts. Existing diffusion-model-based researches either rely on per-view inpainting techniques, which are plagued by severe cross-view inconsistencies and conspicuous seams, or adopt optimization-based approaches that involve substantial computational overhead. In this work, we present RoomPainter, a framework that seamlessly integrates efficiency and consistency to achieve high-fidelity texturing of indoor scenes. The core of RoomPainter features a zero-shot technique that effectively adapts a 2D diffusion model for 3D-consistent texture synthesis, along with a two-stage generation strategy that ensures both global and local consistency. Specifically, we introduce Attention-Guided Multi-View Integrated Sampling (MVIS) combined with a neighbor-integrated attention mechanism for zero-shot texture map generation. Using the MVIS, we firstly generate texture map for the entire room to ensure global consistency, then adopt its variant, namely Attention-Guided Multi-View Integrated Repaint Sampling
  (MVRS) to repaint individual instances within the room, thereby further enhancing local consistency and addressing the occlusion problem. Experiments demonstrate that RoomPainter achieves superior performance for indoor scene texture synthesis in visual quality, global consistency and generation efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Lyu, Rongchen Zhang, Zeqi Ma, Fangjian Liao, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjin Kim, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: While pruning methods effectively maintain model performance without extra training costs, they often focus solely on preserving crucial connections, overlooking the impact of pruned weights on subsequent fine-tuning or distillation, leading to inefficiencies. Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3 and DDPM demonstrate that SVS improves compression performance across model types without additional training costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangwei Ren, Xingyu Jiang, Zizhuo Li, Dingkang Liang, Xin Zhou, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including $19$ cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kam Woh Ng, Jing Yang, Jia Wei Sii, Jiankang Deng, Chee Seng Chan, Yi-Zhe Song, Tao Xiang, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Chirpy3D, a novel approach for fine-grained 3D object generation, tackling the challenging task of synthesizing creative 3D objects in a zero-shot setting, with access only to unposed 2D images of seen categories. Without structured supervision -- such as camera poses, 3D part annotations, or object-specific labels -- the model must infer plausible 3D structures, capture fine-grained details, and generalize to novel objects using only category-level labels from seen categories. To address this, Chirpy3D introduces a multi-view diffusion model that decomposes training objects into anchor parts in an unsupervised manner, representing the latent space of both seen and unseen parts as continuous distributions. This allows smooth interpolation and flexible recombination of parts to generate entirely new objects with species-specific details. A self-supervised feature consistency loss further ensures structural and semantic coherence. The result is the first system capable of generating entirely novel 3D objects with species-specific fine-grained details through flexible part sampling and composition. Our experiments demonstrate that Chirpy3D surpasses existing methods in generating creative 3D objects with higher quality and fine-grained details.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wojciech Zielonka, Stephan J. Garbin, Alexandros Lattas, George Kopanas, Paulo Gotardo, Thabo Beeler, Justus Thies, Timo Bolkart</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable head avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle three major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated (e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent deletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's consent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an appealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to SOTA monocular and GAN-based methods, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longtao Jiang, Zhendong Wang, Jianmin Bao, Wengang Zhou, Dongdong Chen, Lei Shi, Dong Chen, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm, where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our objective is to translate continuous sign language into spoken language text. Inspired by the way human interpreters rely on context for accurate translation, we incorporate additional contextual cues together with the signing video, into a new translation framework. Specifically, besides visual sign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate complementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background show, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses transcribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along with the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we fine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through extensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue to the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL -- the largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our contextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations compared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art methods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign Language dataset, and achieve competitive results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsung Park, Jungbeom Lee, Jongyoon Song, Sangwon Yu, Dahuin Jung, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Zhang, Jianyang Gu, Arpita Chowdhury, Zheda Mai, David Carlyn, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Yu Su, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Class activation map (CAM) has been widely used to highlight image regions that contribute to class predictions. Despite its simplicity and computational efficiency, CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that distinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this limitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes, but at the cost of extra complexity. In this paper, we propose Finer-CAM, a method that retains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative regions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in "how" it explains, but in "what" it explains. Specifically, previous methods attempt to identify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value, which inadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By explicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their differences, Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and emphasizes the unique, discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is easy to implement, compatible with various CAM methods, and can be extended to multi-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts. Additionally, Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength, enabling users to selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details. Quantitatively, we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by Finer-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Liu, Bo Peng, Can Cui, Pengxiang Ding, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which pose significant challenges in security-sensitive applications. Among various adversarial attack strategies, input transformation-based attacks have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in enhancing adversarial transferability. However, existing methods still perform poorly across different architectures, even though they have achieved promising results within the same architecture. This limitation arises because, while models of the same architecture may focus on different regions of the object, the variation is even more pronounced across different architectures. Unfortunately, current approaches fail to effectively guide models to attend to these diverse regions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel input transformation-based attack method, termed Component-Wise Transformation (CWT). CWT applies interpolation and selective rotation to individual image blocks, ensuring that each transformed image highlights different target regions, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset show that CWT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both attack success rates and stability across CNN- and Transformer-based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy.

<p>Abstract: Today's image generation systems are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review. We will make open source our full dataset and code.</p>

<p>Abstract: In human imitation learning, the imitator typically take the egocentric view as a benchmark, naturally transferring behaviors observed from an exocentric view to their owns, which provides inspiration for researching how robots can more effectively imitate human behavior. However, current research primarily focuses on the basic alignment issues of ego-exo data from different cameras, rather than collecting data from the imitator's perspective, which is inconsistent with the high-level cognitive process. To advance this research, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via the imitator's egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 paired exo-ego videos (totaling15804 videos) spanning diverse daily behaviors in various real-world scenarios. For each video pair, one video captures an exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures an egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, EgoMe uniquely incorporates exo-ego eye gaze, other multi-modal sensor IMU data and different-level annotations for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and imitating process. We further provide a suit of challenging benchmarks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the robot imitation learning research. Extensive analysis demonstrates significant advantages over existing datasets. Our EgoMe dataset and benchmarks are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/HeqianQiu/EgoMe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglai Li, Yuqi Shi, Xiao He, Chang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) utilizes information from multiple views to uncover the underlying structures of data. Despite significant advancements in MvC, mitigating the impact of missing samples in specific views on the integration of knowledge from different views remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel Mask-informed Deep Contrastive Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (Mask-IMvC) method, which elegantly identifies a view-common representation for clustering. Specifically, we introduce a mask-informed fusion network that aggregates incomplete multi-view information while considering the observation status of samples across various views as a mask, thereby reducing the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, we design a prior knowledge-assisted contrastive learning loss that boosts the representation capability of the aggregated view-common representation by injecting neighborhood information of samples from different views. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Mask-IMvC method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple MvC datasets, both in complete and incomplete scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bosung Kim, Kyuhwan Lee, Isu Jeong, Jungmin Cheon, Yeojin Lee, Seulki Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We present On-device Sora, the first model training-free solution for diffusion-based on-device text-to-video generation that operates efficiently on smartphone-grade devices. To address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices, the proposed On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to pre-trained video generative models. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive token-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens along the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them into memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the challenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations show that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation on commodity mobile and embedded devices without resource-intensive re-training for model optimization (compression). The code implementation is available at a GitHub repository(https://github.com/eai-lab/On-device-Sora).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jixiang Chen, Jing Chen, Kai Liu, Haochen Chang, Shanfeng Fu, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmented reality assembly guidance is essential for intelligent manufacturing and medical applications, requiring continuous measurement of the 6DoF poses of manipulated objects. Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchang Zhou, Jiwei Wei, Shiyuan He, Yuyang Zhou, Chaoning Zhang, Jie Zou, Ning Xie, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning has become a popular strategy for adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to zero/few-shot visual recognition tasks. Some prompting techniques introduce prior knowledge due to its richness, but when learnable tokens are randomly initialized and disconnected from prior knowledge, they tend to overfit on seen classes and struggle with domain shifts for unseen ones. To address this issue, we propose the InPK model, which infuses class-specific prior knowledge into the learnable tokens during initialization, thus enabling the model to explicitly focus on class-relevant information. Furthermore, to mitigate the weakening of class information by multi-layer encoders, we continuously reinforce the interaction between learnable tokens and prior knowledge across multiple feature levels. This progressive interaction allows the learnable tokens to better capture the fine-grained differences and universal visual concepts within prior knowledge, enabling the model to extract more discriminative and generalized text features. Even for unseen classes, the learned interaction allows the model to capture their common representations and infer their appropriate positions within the existing semantic structure. Moreover, we introduce a learnable text-to-vision projection layer to accommodate the text adjustments, ensuring better alignment of visual-text semantics. Extensive experiments on 11 recognition datasets show that InPK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple zero/few-shot image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanhui Lee, Yeonghwan Song, Jeany Son</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) is an image-agnostic adversarial attack that deceives deep neural networks using a single perturbation generated solely from random noise without relying on data priors. However, traditional data-free UAP methods often suffer from limited transferability due to the absence of semantic content in random noise. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-free universal attack method that recursively extracts pseudo-semantic priors directly from the UAPs during training to enrich the semantic content within the data-free UAP framework. Our approach effectively leverages latent semantic information within UAPs via region sampling, enabling successful input transformations-typically ineffective in traditional data-free UAP methods due to the lack of semantic cues-and significantly enhancing black-box transferability. Furthermore, we introduce a sample reweighting technique to mitigate potential imbalances from random sampling and transformations, emphasizing hard examples less affected by the UAPs. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in average fooling rate by a substantial margin, notably improves attack transferability across various CNN architectures compared to existing data-free UAP methods, and even surpasses data-dependent UAP methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Li, Boyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Paired image-text data with subtle variations in-between (e.g., people holding surfboards vs. people holding shovels) hold the promise of producing Vision-Language Models with proper compositional understanding. Synthesizing such training data from generative models is a highly coveted prize due to the reduced cost of data collection. However, synthesizing training images for compositional learning presents three challenges: (1) efficiency in generating large quantities of images, (2) text alignment between the generated image and the caption in the exact place of the subtle change, and (3) image fidelity in ensuring sufficient similarity with the original real images in all other places. We propose SPARCL (Synthetic Perturbations for Advancing Robust Compositional Learning), which integrates image feature injection into a fast text-to-image generative model, followed by an image style transfer step, to meet the three challenges. Further, to cope with any residual issues of text alignment, we propose an adaptive margin loss to filter out potentially incorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples. Evaluation on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrates that SPARCL significantly improves the compositionality of CLIP, boosting the average accuracy of the CLIP base model by over 8% across all benchmarks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijie Tang, Jiazhao Zhang, Yuqing Lan, Yulan Guo, Dezun Dong, Chenyang Zhu, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online zero-shot 3D instance segmentation of a progressively reconstructed scene is both a critical and challenging task for embodied applications. With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, zero-shot 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqing Shen, Sanping Zhou, Jingwen Fu, Ruotong Wang, Shitao Chen, Nanning Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual place recognition is a challenging task for autonomous driving and robotics, which is usually considered as an image retrieval problem. A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Ding, Jing Han, Yuchuan Tian, Chao Xu, Kai Han, Yehui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has now become the preferred choice for building image generation models due to its great generation capability. Unlike previous convolution-based UNet models, DiT is purely composed of a stack of transformer blocks, which renders DiT excellent in scalability like large language models. However, the growing model size and multi-step sampling paradigm bring about considerable pressure on deployment and inference. In this work, we propose a post-training quantization framework tailored for Diffusion Transforms to tackle these challenges. We firstly locate that the quantization difficulty of DiT mainly originates from the time-dependent channel-specific outliers. We propose a timestep-aware shift-and-scale strategy to smooth the activation distribution to reduce the quantization error. Secondly, based on the observation that activations of adjacent timesteps have similar distributions, we utilize a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the denoising timesteps into multiple groups. We further design a re-parameterization scheme which absorbs the quantization parameters into nearby module to avoid redundant computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that out PTQ method successfully quantize the Diffusion Transformer into 8-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W8A8) with state-of-the-art FiD score. And our method can further quantize DiT model into 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) without sacrificing generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze He, Bo Cheng, Yuhang Ma, Qingxiang Jia, Shanyuan Liu, Ao Ma, Xiaoyu Wu, Liebucha Wu, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified layout planning and image generation model, PlanGen, which can pre-plan spatial layout conditions before generating images. Unlike previous diffusion-based models that treat layout planning and layout-to-image as two separate models, PlanGen jointly models the two tasks into one autoregressive transformer using only next-token prediction. PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our PlanGen in multiple layoutrelated tasks, showing its great potential. Code is available at: https://360cvgroup.github.io/PlanGen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary multiple object tracking aims to generalize trackers to unseen categories during training, enabling their application across a variety of real-world scenarios. However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability. Models and code are released at https://github.com/jinyanglii/OVTR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoying Zhang, Da Peng, Yipeng Zhang, Zonghao Guo, Chengyue Wu, Chi Chen, Wei Ke, Helen Meng, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time compute scaling and post-training optimization, driven by concerns over limited high-quality real-world data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient for advancing model capabilities. We hypothesize that effective model improvement requires a strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time compute scaling, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we validate this hypothesis in the context of multimodal pre-training for foundation MLLM construction. We introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we introduce Chain-of-Description, a step-by-step visual understanding method to improve comprehensive perception, and integrate structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced model then generates candidate image captions and CoT-style reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are curated through a self-consistency mechanism. These curated samples are subsequently used for large-scale multimodal pre-training, completing a self-learning cycle that strengthens the model's cognitive foundation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with substantially improved multimodal cognition, outperforming prevailing pre-training approaches. These findings empirically establish SIcog as a promising framework for realizing a complete self-improving paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biofouling$\unicode{x2013}$communities of organisms that grow on hard surfaces immersed in water$\unicode{x2013}$provides a pathway for the spread of invasive marine species and diseases. To address this risk, international vessels are increasingly being obligated to provide evidence of their biofouling management practices. Verification that these activities are effective requires underwater inspections, using divers or underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and the collection and analysis of large amounts of imagery and footage. Automated assessment using computer vision techniques can significantly streamline this process, and this work shows how this challenge can be addressed efficiently and effectively using the interpretable Component Features (ComFe) approach with a DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation model. ComFe is able to obtain improved performance in comparison to previous non-interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods, with significantly fewer weights and greater transparency$\unicode{x2013}$through identifying which regions of the image contribute to the classification, and which images in the training data lead to that conclusion.

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding framework for real-world image dehazing, abbreviated as IPC-Dehaze, which leverages the high-quality codebook prior encapsulated in a pre-trained VQGAN. Apart from previous codebook-based methods that rely on one-shot decoding, our method utilizes high-quality codes obtained in the previous iteration to guide the prediction of the Code-Predictor in the subsequent iteration, improving code prediction accuracy and ensuring stable dehazing performance. Our idea stems from the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze density and scene depth, and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring dense haze regions. However, it is non-trivial to progressively refine the obtained codes in subsequent iterations, owing to the difficulty in determining which codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key insight of our study is to propose Code-Critic to capture interrelations among codes. The Code-Critic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample a set of codes with the highest mask scores, i.e., a higher score indicates that the code is more likely to be rejected, which helps retain more accurate codes and predict difficult ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although existing text-to-motion (T2M) methods can produce realistic human motion from text description, it is still difficult to align the generated motion with the desired postures since using text alone is insufficient for precisely describing diverse postures. To achieve more controllable generation, an intuitive way is to allow the user to input a few motion frames describing precise desired postures. Thus, we explore a new Text-Frame-to-Motion (TF2M) generation task that aims to generate motions from text and very few given frames. Intuitively, the closer a frame is to a given frame, the lower the uncertainty of this frame is when conditioned on this given frame. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Motion Generation (PMG) method to progressively generate a motion from the frames with low uncertainty to those with high uncertainty in multiple stages. During each stage, new frames are generated by a Text-Frame Guided Generator conditioned on frame-aware semantics of the text, given frames, and frames generated in previous stages. Additionally, to alleviate the train-test gap caused by multi-stage accumulation of incorrectly generated frames during testing, we propose a Pseudo-frame Replacement Strategy for training. Experimental results show that our PMG outperforms existing T2M generation methods by a large margin with even one given frame, validating the effectiveness of our PMG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Hongwei Yi, Hanzhong Guo, Tian Ye, Daquan Zhou, Michael Lingelbach, Zhiqiang Xu, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, open-source video diffusion models (VDMs), such as WanX, Magic141 and HunyuanVideo, have been scaled to over 10 billion parameters. These large-scale VDMs have demonstrated significant improvements over smaller-scale VDMs across multiple dimensions, including enhanced visual quality and more natural motion dynamics. However, these models face two major limitations: (1) High inference overhead: Large-scale VDMs require approximately 10 minutes to synthesize a 28-step video on a single H100 GPU. (2) Limited in portrait video synthesis: Models like WanX-I2V and HunyuanVideo-I2V often produce unnatural facial expressions and movements in portrait videos. To address these challenges, we propose MagicDistillation, a novel framework designed to reduce inference overhead while ensuring the generalization of VDMs for portrait video synthesis. Specifically, we primarily use sufficiently high-quality talking video to fine-tune Magic141, which is dedicated to portrait video synthesis. We then employ LoRA to effectively and efficiently fine-tune the fake DiT within the step distillation framework known as distribution matching distillation (DMD). Following this, we apply weak-to-strong (W2S) distribution matching and minimize the discrepancy between the fake data distribution and the ground truth distribution, thereby improving the visual fidelity and motion dynamics of the synthesized videos. Experimental results on portrait video synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicDistillation, as our method surpasses Euler, LCM, and DMD baselines in both FID/FVD metrics and VBench. Moreover, MagicDistillation, requiring only 4 steps, also outperforms WanX-I2V (14B) and HunyuanVideo-I2V (13B) on visualization and VBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Lin, Yunfan Wu, Yuhang Ma, Junzhou Chen, Ronghui Zhang, Jiaming Wu, Guodong Yin, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting traffic signs effectively under low-light conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. Firstly, we introduce the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-TOD) module to address indistinct small-object features in low-light scenarios. By leveraging high-resolution feature maps, HRFM-TOD effectively mitigates the feature dilution problem encountered in conventional PANet frameworks, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and inference speed. Secondly, we develop the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module, which facilitates deep feature interaction across multiple receptive fields in both channel and spatial dimensions, significantly improving the model's information extraction capabilities. Finally, we propose the Prior-Guided Enhancement Module (PGFE) to tackle common image quality challenges in low-light environments, such as noise, low contrast, and blurriness. This module employs prior knowledge to enrich image details and enhance visibility, substantially boosting detection performance. To support this research, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios, including urban, highway, and rural environments under varying weather conditions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, and achieving superior results on the CCTSDB2021 dataset. Moreover, deployment experiments on edge devices confirm the real-time applicability and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Lai, Jike Zhong, Ming Li, Shitian Zhao, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced reasoning in natural scenes, but their role in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical reasoning tasks demand robust image analysis and well-justified answers, posing challenges due to the complexity of medical images. Transparency and trustworthiness are essential for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. We introduce Med-R1, a framework exploring reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance VLMs' generalizability and trustworthiness in medical reasoning. Leveraging the DeepSeek strategy, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to guide reasoning paths via reward signals. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often overfits and lacks generalization, RL fosters robust and diverse reasoning. Med-R1 is evaluated across eight medical imaging modalities: CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Dermoscopy, Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Microscopy, and X-ray Imaging. Compared to its base model, Qwen2-VL-2B, Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% accuracy improvement and outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B, which has 36 times more parameters. Testing across five question types-modality recognition, anatomy identification, disease diagnosis, lesion grading, and biological attribute analysis Med-R1 demonstrates superior generalization, exceeding Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% and surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B in question-type generalization. These findings show that RL improves medical reasoning and enables parameter-efficient models to outperform significantly larger ones. By demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task performance, Med-R1 points toward a new direction for developing practical and generalizable medical VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Xiao, Qiannan Han, Gang Shu, Guiping Liang, Hongyan Zhang, Song Wang, Zhihao Xu, Weican Wan, Chuang Li, Guitao Jiang, Yi Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate body dimension and weight measurements are critical for optimizing poultry management, health assessment, and economic efficiency. This study introduces an innovative deep learning-based model leveraging multimodal data-2D RGB images from different views, depth images, and 3D point clouds-for the non-invasive estimation of duck body dimensions and weight. A dataset of 1,023 Linwu ducks, comprising over 5,000 samples with diverse postures and conditions, was collected to support model training. The proposed method innovatively employs PointNet++ to extract key feature points from point clouds, extracts and computes corresponding 3D geometric features, and fuses them with multi-view convolutional 2D features. A Transformer encoder is then utilized to capture long-range dependencies and refine feature interactions, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.33% and an R2 of 0.953 across eight morphometric parameters, demonstrating strong predictive capability. Unlike conventional manual measurements, the proposed model enables high-precision estimation while eliminating the necessity for physical handling, thereby reducing animal stress and broadening its application scope. This study marks the first application of deep learning techniques to poultry body dimension and weight estimation, providing a valuable reference for the intelligent and precise management of the livestock industry with far-reaching practical significance.</p>

<p>Abstract: How do two deep neural networks differ in how they arrive at a decision? Measuring the similarity of deep networks has been a long-standing open question. Most existing methods provide a single number to measure the similarity of two networks at a given layer, but give no insight into what makes them similar or dissimilar. We introduce an interpretable representational similarity method (RSVC) to compare two networks. We use RSVC to discover shared and unique visual concepts between two models. We show that some aspects of model differences can be attributed to unique concepts discovered by one model that are not well represented in the other. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation across different vision model architectures and training protocols to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Li, Lei Li, Kun Ouyang, Shuhuai Ren, Yuanxin Liu, Yuanxing Zhang, Fuzheng Zhang, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu, Xu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved significant success by leveraging a two-stage paradigm: pretraining on large-scale video-text data for vision-language alignment, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for task-specific capabilities. However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980">Token Dynamics: Towards Efficient and Dynamic Video Token Representation for Video Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling LLMs to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction, such as token pruning and token merging, often disrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately balance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods result in lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language models. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token reduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number of tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video representation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving spatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations by separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring them into: 1. a concise token hash table, created by clustering tokens that describe object-level content; 2. a token indices key map, capturing detailed spatial-temporal motion patterns across grids; 3. a token hash function, which vector-quantizes the token hash table to reconstruct the token sequence from the key map. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the token base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and spatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token count to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance drop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token reduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression). Our method offers significantly lower theoretical complexity, fewer tokens, and enhanced throughput, thus providing an efficient solution for video LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanmin Tang, Jing Yu, Keke Gai, Jiamin Zhuang, Gang Xiong, Gaopeng Gou, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerred Chen, Ronald Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: In many robotics and VR/AR applications, fast camera motions cause a high level of motion blur, causing existing camera pose estimation methods to fail. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models often struggle with long prompts detailing complex scenes, diverse objects with distinct visual characteristics and spatial relationships. In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Dag\`es, Simon Weber, Ya-Wei Eileen Lin, Ronen Talmon, Daniel Cremers, Michael Lindenbaum, Alfred M. Bruckstein, Ron Kimmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task that aims to simplify complex data by reducing its feature dimensionality while preserving essential patterns, with core applications in data analysis and visualisation. To preserve the underlying data structure, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods focus on preserving pairwise dissimilarities, such as distances. They optimise the embedding to have pairwise distances as close as possible to the data dissimilarities. However, the current standard is limited to embedding data in Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by the lack of asymmetry in the Riemannian metric of the embedding space, this paper extends the MDS problem to a natural asymmetric generalisation of Riemannian manifolds called Finsler manifolds. Inspired by Euclidean space, we define a canonical Finsler space for embedding asymmetric data. Due to its simplicity with respect to geodesics, data representation in this space is both intuitive and simple to analyse. We demonstrate that our generalisation benefits from the same theoretical convergence guarantees. We reveal the effectiveness of our Finsler embedding across various types of non-symmetric data, highlighting its value in applications such as data visualisation, dimensionality reduction, directed graph embedding, and link prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demand substantial computational resources during inference, largely due to the extensive visual input tokens for representing visual information. Previous studies have noted that visual tokens tend to receive less attention than text tokens, suggesting their lower importance during inference and potential for pruning. However, their methods encounter several challenges: reliance on greedy heuristic criteria for token importance and incompatibility with FlashAttention and KV cache. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{TopV}, a compatible \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory \textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or fine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning as an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens while remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only perform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces KV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost function considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial Distance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each source visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token pruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Zhai, Xinyu Chen, Can Zhang, Tianming Sha, Ruirui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted significant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA methods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached feature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these features to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval methods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme samples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class distributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of cached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive and reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called "Cache, Residual, Gaussian" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable residual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes with text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but also incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model intra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy features. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Zhang, Emily Yue-ting Jia, Junsheng Zhou, Baorui Ma, Kanle Shi, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, it has shown that priors are vital for neural implicit functions to reconstruct high-quality surfaces from multi-view RGB images. However, current priors require large-scale pre-training, and merely provide geometric clues without considering the importance of color. In this paper, we present NeRFPrior, which adopts a neural radiance field as a prior to learn signed distance fields using volume rendering for surface reconstruction. Our NeRF prior can provide both geometric and color clues, and also get trained fast under the same scene without additional data. Based on the NeRF prior, we are enabled to learn a signed distance function (SDF) by explicitly imposing a multi-view consistency constraint on each ray intersection for surface inference. Specifically, at each ray intersection, we use the density in the prior as a coarse geometry estimation, while using the color near the surface as a clue to check its visibility from another view angle. For the textureless areas where the multi-view consistency constraint does not work well, we further introduce a depth consistency loss with confidence weights to infer the SDF. Our experimental results outperform the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monocular depth priors have been widely adopted by neural rendering in multi-view based tasks such as 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, due to the inconsistent prediction on each view, how to more effectively leverage monocular cues in a multi-view context remains a challenge. Current methods treat the entire estimated depth map indiscriminately, and use it as ground truth supervision, while ignoring the inherent inaccuracy and cross-view inconsistency in monocular priors. To resolve these issues, we propose MonoInstance, a general approach that explores the uncertainty of monocular depths to provide enhanced geometric priors for neural rendering and reconstruction. Our key insight lies in aligning each segmented instance depths from multiple views within a common 3D space, thereby casting the uncertainty estimation of monocular depths into a density measure within noisy point clouds. For high-uncertainty areas where depth priors are unreliable, we further introduce a constraint term that encourages the projected instances to align with corresponding instance masks on nearby views. MonoInstance is a versatile strategy which can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-view neural rendering frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that MonoInstance significantly improves the performance in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis under various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory modeling has primarily focused on forecasting future states, often overlooking broader tasks like trajectory completion, which are crucial for real-world applications such as correcting tracking data. Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning combining pathology images and genomic sequences enhances cancer survival analysis but faces clinical implementation barriers due to limited access to genomic sequencing in under-resourced regions. To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yabin Wang, Zhiwu Huang, Xiaopeng Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper identifies OpenSDI, a challenge for spotting diffusion-generated images in open-world settings. In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Moshtaghi, Siavash H. Khajavi, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungin Park, Jiyoung Lee, Kwanghoon Sohn</p>
<p>Abstract: View-invariant representation learning from egocentric (first-person, ego) and exocentric (third-person, exo) videos is a promising approach toward generalizing video understanding systems across multiple viewpoints. However, this area has been underexplored due to the substantial differences in perspective, motion patterns, and context between ego and exo views. In this paper, we propose a novel masked ego-exo modeling that promotes both causal temporal dynamics and cross-view alignment, called Bootstrap Your Own Views (BYOV), for fine-grained view-invariant video representation learning from unpaired ego-exo videos. We highlight the importance of capturing the compositional nature of human actions as a basis for robust cross-view understanding. Specifically, self-view masking and cross-view masking predictions are designed to learn view-invariant and powerful representations concurrently. Experimental results demonstrate that our BYOV significantly surpasses existing approaches with notable gains across all metrics in four downstream ego-exo video tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konyul Park, Yecheol Kim, Daehun Kim, Jun Won Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern autonomous driving perception systems utilize complementary multi-modal sensors, such as LiDAR and cameras. Although sensor fusion architectures enhance performance in challenging environments, they still suffer significant performance drops under severe sensor failures, such as LiDAR beam reduction, LiDAR drop, limited field of view, camera drop, and occlusion. This limitation stems from inter-modality dependencies in current sensor fusion frameworks. In this study, we introduce an efficient and robust LiDAR-camera 3D object detector, referred to as MoME, which can achieve robust performance through a mixture of experts approach. Our MoME fully decouples modality dependencies using three parallel expert decoders, which use camera features, LiDAR features, or a combination of both to decode object queries, respectively. We propose Multi-Expert Decoding (MED) framework, where each query is decoded selectively using one of three expert decoders. MoME utilizes an Adaptive Query Router (AQR) to select the most appropriate expert decoder for each query based on the quality of camera and LiDAR features. This ensures that each query is processed by the best-suited expert, resulting in robust performance across diverse sensor failure scenarios. We evaluated the performance of MoME on the nuScenes-R benchmark. Our MoME achieved state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather and sensor failure conditions, significantly outperforming the existing models across various sensor failure scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhou, Jiahao Li, Zunnan Xu, Hanhui Li, Yiji Cheng, Fa-Ting Hong, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods. Our project is available at https://zjgans.github.io/fireedit.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a critical challenge in the era of advanced generative models, particularly as synthetic media becomes more sophisticated. In this study, we explore the potential of state of the art multi-modal (reasoning) large language models (LLMs) for deepfake image detection such as (OpenAI O1/4o, Gemini thinking Flash 2, Deepseek Janus, Grok 3, llama 3.2, Qwen 2/2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, Claude 3.5/3.7 sonnet) . We benchmark 12 latest multi-modal LLMs against traditional deepfake detection methods across multiple datasets, including recently published real-world deepfake imagery. To enhance performance, we employ prompt tuning and conduct an in-depth analysis of the models' reasoning pathways to identify key contributing factors in their decision-making process. Our findings indicate that best multi-modal LLMs achieve competitive performance with promising generalization ability with zero shot, even surpass traditional deepfake detection pipelines in out-of-distribution datasets while the rest of the LLM families performs extremely disappointing with some worse than random guess. Furthermore, we found newer model version and reasoning capabilities does not contribute to performance in such niche tasks of deepfake detection while model size do help in some cases. This study highlights the potential of integrating multi-modal reasoning in future deepfake detection frameworks and provides insights into model interpretability for robustness in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prin Phunyaphibarn, Phillip Y. Lee, Jaihoon Kim, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghao Wang, Tao Gong, Qi Chu, Bin Liu, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Malicious image manipulation poses societal risks, increasing the importance of effective image manipulation detection methods. Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Ma, Guohai Xu, Xiaoshuai Sun, Jiayi Ji, Jie Lou, Debing Zhang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) has emerged as a crucial technique for enabling multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to follow user instructions adeptly. Yet, a significant gap persists in understanding the attributes of high-quality instruction tuning data and frameworks for its automated selection. To address this, we introduce MLLM-Selector, an automated approach that identifies valuable data for VIT by weighing necessity and diversity. Our process starts by randomly sampling a subset from the VIT data pool to fine-tune a pretrained model, thus creating a seed model with an initial ability to follow instructions. Then, leveraging the seed model, we calculate necessity scores for each sample in the VIT data pool to identify samples pivotal for enhancing model performance. Our findings underscore the importance of mixing necessity and diversity in data choice, leading to the creation of MLLM-Selector, our methodology that fuses necessity scoring with strategic sampling for superior data refinement. Empirical results indicate that within identical experimental conditions, MLLM-Selector surpasses LLaVA-1.5 in some benchmarks with less than 1% of the data and consistently exceeds performance across all validated benchmarks when using less than 50%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoumeh Sharafi, Emma Ollivier, Muhammad Osama Zeeshan, Soufiane Belharbi, Marco Pedersoli, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Simon Bacon, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) from videos is a crucial task in various application areas, such as human-computer interaction and health monitoring (e.g., pain, depression, fatigue, and stress). Beyond the challenges of recognizing subtle emotional or health states, the effectiveness of deep FER models is often hindered by the considerable variability of expressions among subjects. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods are employed to adapt a pre-trained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy and storage issues. Typically, SFDA methods adapt to a target domain dataset corresponding to an entire population and assume it includes data from all recognition classes. However, collecting such comprehensive target data can be difficult or even impossible for FER in healthcare applications. In many real-world scenarios, it may be feasible to collect a short neutral control video (displaying only neutral expressions) for target subjects before deployment. These videos can be used to adapt a model to better handle the variability of expressions among subjects. This paper introduces the Disentangled Source-Free Domain Adaptation (DSFDA) method to address the SFDA challenge posed by missing target expression data. DSFDA leverages data from a neutral target control video for end-to-end generation and adaptation of target data with missing non-neutral data. Our method learns to disentangle features related to expressions and identity while generating the missing non-neutral target data, thereby enhancing model accuracy. Additionally, our self-supervision strategy improves model adaptation by reconstructing target images that maintain the same identity and source expression. Experimental results on the challenging BioVid and UNBC-McMaster pain datasets indicate that our DSFDA approach can outperform state-of-the-art adaptation method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in general image segmentation achieved by large-scale pre-trained foundation models (such as Meta's Segment Any-thing Model (SAM) series and DINOv2), their performance in specialized fields remains limited by two critical issues: the excessive training costs due to large model parameters, and the insufficient ability to represent specific domain characteristics. This paper proposes a multi-scale feature collabora-tion framework guided by DINOv2 for SAM2, with core innovations in three aspects: (1) Establishing a feature collaboration mechanism between DINOv2 and SAM2 backbones, where high-dimensional semantic features extracted by the self-supervised model guide multi-scale feature fusion; (2) Designing lightweight adapter modules and cross-modal, cross-layer feature fusion units to inject cross-domain knowledge while freezing the base model parameters; (3) Constructing a U-shaped network structure based on U-net, which utilizes attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive aggregation decoding of multi-granularity features. This framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art meth-ods in downstream tasks such as camouflage target detection and salient ob-ject detection, without requiring costly training processes. It provides a tech-nical pathway for efficient deployment of visual image segmentation, demon-strating significant application value in a wide range of downstream tasks and specialized fields within image segmentation.Project page: https://github.com/CheneyXuYiMin/SAM2DINO-Seg</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D reconstruction and generation have demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, a notable conditioning gap can be observed between these two fields, e.g., scalable 3D scene reconstruction often requires densely captured views, whereas 3D generation typically relies on a single or no input view, which significantly limits their applications. We found that the source of this phenomenon lies in the misalignment between 3D constraints and generative priors. To address this problem, we propose a reconstruction-driven video diffusion model that learns to condition video frames on artifact-prone RGB-D renderings. Moreover, we propose a cyclical fusion pipeline that iteratively adds restoration frames from the generative model to the training set, enabling progressive expansion and addressing the viewpoint saturation limitations seen in previous reconstruction and generation pipelines. Our evaluation, including view synthesis from sparse view and masked input, validates the effectiveness of our approach. More details at https://genfusion.sibowu.com.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Activation Functions introduce non-linearity in the deep neural networks. This nonlinearity helps the neural networks learn faster and efficiently from the dataset. In deep learning, many activation functions are developed and used based on the type of problem statement. ReLU's variants, SWISH, and MISH are goto activation functions. MISH function is considered having similar or even better performance than SWISH, and much better than ReLU. In this paper, we propose an activation function named APTx which behaves similar to MISH, but requires lesser mathematical operations to compute. The lesser computational requirements of APTx does speed up the model training, and thus also reduces the hardware requirement for the deep learning model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Reza Zarei, Majid Komeili</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) presents a challenging learning problem in which only a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more important in few-shot classification due to a greater chance of error compared to traditional classification. However, the majority of the previous FSL methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Previously, human-friendly attributes have been utilized to train models with the potential for human interaction and interpretability. However, such approaches are not directly extendible to the few-shot classification scenario. Moreover, we propose an online attribute selection mechanism to effectively filter out irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism improves accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of attributes that participate in each episode. We further propose a mechanism that automatically detects the episodes where the pool of available human-friendly attributes is insufficient, and subsequently augments it by engaging some learned unknown attributes. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot learning models on four widely used datasets. We also empirically evaluate the level of decision alignment between different models and human understanding and show that our model outperforms the comparison methods based on this criterion.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-mechanical model that bridges the realms of cognition and quantum mechanics, offering a novel perspective on decision-making under risk and perceptual reversals. By integrating quantum theories addressing decision-theoretic anomalies with examples from immersive video games like "Deal or No Deal", we seek to elucidate complex human cognitive behaviours. Study 1 showcases the proposed quantum model's superiority over traditional decision-making approaches using the "Deal or No Deal" video game experiment. In Study 2, we apply our model to bistable perceptions, taking the Necker cube from the Necker game as a primary example. While previous works have hinted at connections between quantum mechanics and cognition, Study 3 provides a more tangible link, likening the physics that underpins quantum tunnelling to an eye blink's role in perceptual reversals. Conclusively, our model displays a promising ability to interpret diverse optical illusions and psychological phenomena, marking a significant stride in understanding human decision making.</p>

<p>Abstract: How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p>

Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matyas Bohacek, Hany Farid</p>
<p>Abstract: Trained on massive amounts of human-generated content, AI-generated image synthesis is capable of reproducing semantically coherent images that match the visual appearance of its training data. We show that when retrained on even small amounts of their own creation, these generative-AI models produce highly distorted images. We also show that this distortion extends beyond the text prompts used in retraining, and that once affected, the models struggle to fully heal even after retraining on only real images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xizhi Wang, Yaxiong Wang, Mengjian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a Geometric-Photometric Joint Alignment~(GPJA) method, which aligns discrete human expressions at pixel-level accuracy by combining geometric and photometric information. Common practices for registering human heads typically involve aligning landmarks with facial template meshes using geometry processing approaches, but often overlook dense pixel-level photometric consistency. This oversight leads to inconsistent texture parametrization across different expressions, hindering the creation of topologically consistent head meshes widely used in movies and games. GPJA overcomes this limitation by leveraging differentiable rendering to align vertices with target expressions, achieving joint alignment in both geometry and photometric appearances automatically, without requiring semantic annotation or pre-aligned meshes for training. It features a holistic rendering alignment mechanism and a multiscale regularized optimization for robust convergence on large deformation. The method utilizes derivatives at vertex positions for supervision and employs a gradient-based algorithm which guarantees smoothness and avoids topological artifacts during the geometry evolution. Experimental results demonstrate faithful alignment under various expressions, surpassing the conventional non-rigid ICP-based methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning based method. In practical, our method generates meshes of the same subject across diverse expressions, all with the same texture parametrization. This consistency benefits face animation, re-parametrization, and other batch operations for face modeling and applications with enhanced efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Paz-Ruza, David Esteban-Mart\'inez, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos, Bertha Guijarro-Berdi\~nas</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual explanations based on user-uploaded images are an effective and self-contained approach to provide transparency to Recommender Systems (RS), but intrinsic limitations of data used in this explainability paradigm cause existing approaches to use bad quality training data that is highly sparse and suffers from labelling noise. Popular training enrichment approaches like model enlargement or massive data gathering are expensive and environmentally unsustainable, thus we seek to provide better visual explanations to RS aligning with the principles of Responsible AI. In this work, we research the intersection of effective and sustainable training enrichment strategies for visual-based RS explainability models by developing three novel strategies that focus on training Data Quality: 1) selection of reliable negative training examples using Positive-unlabelled Learning, 2) transform-based data augmentation, and 3) text-to-image generative-based data augmentation. The integration of these strategies in three state-of-the-art explainability models increases 5% the performance in relevant ranking metrics of these visual-based RS explainability models without penalizing their practical long-term sustainability, as tested in multiple real-world restaurant recommendation explanation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoqing Chen, Jiawei Sun, Xibin Yang, Xinyi Ye, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li, Juergen Czarske</p>
<p>Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn L\"utjens, Raffaele Ferrari, Duncan Watson-Parris, Noelle Selin</p>
<p>Abstract: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies, degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for emulating precipitation. We publish our code and data at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rotem Benisty, Yevgenia Shteynman, Moshe Porat, Anat Ilivitzki, Moti Freiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial in diagnosing various abdominal conditions and anomalies. Traditional MRI scans often yield anisotropic data due to technical constraints, resulting in varying resolutions across spatial dimensions, which limits diagnostic accuracy and volumetric analysis. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to address these limitations by reconstructing isotropic high-resolution images from anisotropic data. However, current SR methods often depend on indirect mappings and scarce 3D isotropic data for training, primarily focusing on two-dimensional enhancements rather than achieving genuine three-dimensional isotropy. We introduce ``SIMPLE,'' a Simultaneous Multi-Plane Self-Supervised Learning approach for isotropic MRI restoration from anisotropic data. Our method leverages existing anisotropic clinical data acquired in different planes, bypassing the need for simulated downsampling processes. By considering the inherent three-dimensional nature of MRI data, SIMPLE ensures realistic isotropic data generation rather than solely improving through-plane slices. This approach's flexibility allows it to be extended to multiple contrast types and acquisition methods commonly used in clinical settings. Our experiments on two distinct datasets (brain and abdomen) show that SIMPLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively using the Kernel Inception Distance (KID), semi-quantitatively through radiologist evaluations, and qualitatively through Fourier domain analysis. The generated isotropic volume facilitates more accurate volumetric analysis and 3D reconstructions, promising significant improvements in clinical diagnostic capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Plou, Pablo Pueyo, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Mac Schwager, Ana C. Murillo, Eduardo Montijano</p>
<p>Abstract: Gen-Swarms is an innovative method that leverages and combines the capabilities of deep generative models with reactive navigation algorithms to automate the creation of drone shows. Advancements in deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in generating high-quality 2D images. Building on this success, various works have extended diffusion models to 3D point cloud generation. In contrast, alternative generative models such as flow matching have been proposed, offering a simple and intuitive transition from noise to meaningful outputs. However, the application of flow matching models to 3D point cloud generation remains largely unexplored. Gen-Swarms adapts these models to automatically generate drone shows. Existing 3D point cloud generative models create point trajectories which are impractical for drone swarms. In contrast, our method not only generates accurate 3D shapes but also guides the swarm motion, producing smooth trajectories and accounting for potential collisions through a reactive navigation algorithm incorporated into the sampling process. For example, when given a text category like Airplane, Gen-Swarms can rapidly and continuously generate numerous variations of 3D airplane shapes. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is particularly well-suited for drone shows, providing feasible trajectories, creating representative final shapes, and significantly enhancing the overall performance of drone show generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angela Lopez-Cardona, Carlos Segura, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Sergi Abadal, Ioannis Arapakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Claude, and Gemini, which excel across a range of tasks but require extensive fine-tuning to align their outputs with human expectations. A widely used method for achieving this alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, despite its success, faces challenges in accurately modelling human preferences. In this paper, we introduce GazeReward, a novel framework that integrates implicit feedback -- and specifically eye-tracking (ET) data -- into the Reward Model (RM). In addition, we explore how ET-based features can provide insights into user preferences. Through ablation studies we test our framework with different integration methods, LLMs, and ET generator models, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RM on established human preference datasets. This work advances the ongoing discussion on optimizing AI alignment with human values, exploring the potential of cognitive data for shaping future NLP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Yongxin Chen, Jaewoong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) theory investigates the cost-minimizing transport map that moves a source distribution to a target distribution. Recently, several approaches have emerged for learning the optimal transport map for a given cost function using neural networks. We refer to these approaches as the OT Map. OT Map provides a powerful tool for diverse machine learning tasks, such as generative modeling and unpaired image-to-image translation. However, existing methods that utilize max-min optimization often experience training instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve stability and achieve a better approximation of the OT Map by exploiting displacement interpolation, dubbed Displacement Interpolation Optimal Transport Model (DIOTM). We derive the dual formulation of displacement interpolation at specific time $t$ and prove how these dual problems are related across time. This result allows us to utilize the entire trajectory of displacement interpolation in learning the OT Map. Our method improves the training stability and achieves superior results in estimating optimal transport maps. We demonstrate that DIOTM outperforms existing OT-based models on image-to-image translation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Risheek Garrepalli, Shweta Mahajan, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuleen Sasse, Shan Chen, Jackson Pond, Danielle Bitterman, John Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) gain widespread use, their fairness remains under-explored. In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness for both LLaVa and CLIP models. Scene-based datasets like PATA and VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their text prompts allowing the model to guess the answer without a picture. As for pronoun-based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate these two problems, we introduce a more rigorous evaluation dataset and a debiasing method based on Sparse Autoencoders to help reduce bias in models. We find that our data set generates more meaningful errors than the previous data sets. Furthermore, our debiasing method improves fairness, gaining 5-15 points in performance over the baseline. This study displays the problems with the current benchmarks for measuring demographic bias in Vision Language Models and introduces both a more effective dataset for measuring bias and a novel and interpretable debiasing method based on Sparse Autoencoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Kamoi, Yusen Zhang, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception -- 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue -- fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) Bottleneck in the architecture -- LVLMs using stronger LLMs exhibit better geometric perception on VisOnlyQA, while it does not require complex reasoning, suggesting that the way LVLMs process information from visual encoders is a bottleneck.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Schmidt, Julian Daubermann, Marcel Mitschke, Constantin Blessing, Stefan Meyer, Markus Enzweiler, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust SLAM is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, semi-structured environments such as parks and gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Chun Yang, Sicheng Dai, Saige Rutherford, Christian Gaser, Andre F Marquand, Christian F Beckmann, Thomas Wolfers</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging is challenging. In this paper, we propose self-supervised masked mesh learning for unsupervised anomaly detection on 3D cortical surfaces. Our framework leverages the intrinsic geometry of the cortical surface to learn a self-supervised representation that captures the underlying structure of the brain. We introduce a masked mesh convolutional neural network (MMN) that learns to predict masked regions of the cortical surface. By training the MMN on a large dataset of healthy subjects, we learn a representation that captures the normal variation in the cortical surface. We then use this representation to detect anomalies in unseen individuals by calculating anomaly scores based on the reconstruction error of the MMN. We evaluated our framework by training on population-scale dataset UKB and HCP-Aging and testing on two datasets of Alzheimer's disease patients ADNI and OASIS3. Our results show that our framework can detect anomalies in cortical thickness, cortical volume, and cortical sulcus characteristics, which are known to be biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Our proposed framework provides a promising approach for unsupervised anomaly detection based on normative variation of cortical features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Li, Ke Zhang, Shuai Wang, Kong Aik Lee, Man-Wai Mak, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture using time-synchronized visual cues. In real-world scenarios, visual cues are not always available due to various impairments, which undermines the stability of AV-TSE. Despite this challenge, humans can maintain attentional momentum over time, even when the target speaker is not visible. In this paper, we introduce the Momentum Multi-modal target Speaker Extraction (MoMuSE), which retains a speaker identity momentum in memory, enabling the model to continuously track the target speaker. Designed for real-time inference, MoMuSE extracts the current speech window with guidance from both visual cues and dynamically updated speaker momentum. Experimental results demonstrate that MoMuSE exhibits significant improvement, particularly in scenarios with severe impairment of visual cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jizhihui Liu, Qixun Teng, Qing Ma, Junjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy image (FMI) denoising faces critical challenges due to the compound mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise with strong spatial correlation and the impracticality of acquiring paired noisy/clean data in dynamic biomedical scenarios. While supervised methods trained on synthetic noise (e.g., Gaussian/Poisson) suffer from out-of-distribution generalization issues, existing self-supervised approaches degrade under real FMI noise due to oversimplified noise assumptions and computationally intensive deep architectures. In this paper, we propose Fluorescence Micrograph to Self (FM2S), a zero-shot denoiser that achieves efficient FMI denoising through three key innovations: 1) A noise injection module that ensures training data sufficiency through adaptive Poisson-Gaussian synthesis while preserving spatial correlation and global statistics of FMI noise for robust model generalization; 2) A two-stage progressive learning strategy that first recovers structural priors via pre-denoised targets then refines high-frequency details through noise distribution alignment; 3) An ultra-lightweight network (3.5k parameters) enabling rapid convergence with 270$\times$ faster training and inference than SOTAs. Extensive experiments across FMI datasets demonstrate FM2S's superiority: It outperforms CVF-SID by 1.4dB PSNR on average while requiring 0.1% parameters of AP-BSN. Notably, FM2S maintains stable performance across varying noise levels, proving its practicality for microscopy platforms with diverse sensor characteristics. Code and datasets will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Litingyu Wang, Wenjun Liao, Shichuan Zhang, Guotai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Head and neck tumors and metastatic lymph nodes are crucial for treatment planning and prognostic analysis. Accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of these structures require pixel-level annotation, making automated segmentation techniques essential for the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of multiple strategies on the segmentation of pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) images. For the segmentation of pre-RT images, we utilized: 1) a fully supervised learning approach, and 2) the same approach enhanced with pre-trained weights and the MixUp data augmentation technique. For mid-RT images, we introduced a novel computational-friendly network architecture that features separate encoders for mid-RT images and registered pre-RT images with their labels. The mid-RT encoder branch integrates information from pre-RT images and labels progressively during the forward propagation. We selected the highest-performing model from each fold and used their predictions to create an ensemble average for inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renyang Liu, Ziyu Lyu, Wei Zhou, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural ones remains a key challenge. Despite advancements in generative models, significant discrepancies persist. To systematically investigate and quantify these discrepancies, we introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy accessing benchmark (\textit{D-Judge}) aimed at addressing the critical question: \textit{how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images?} We construct \textit{D-ANI}, a dataset with 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AIGIs generated by nine models using Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I) prompts. Our framework evaluates the discrepancy across five dimensions: naive image quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream applicability, and human validation. Results reveal notable gaps, emphasizing the importance of aligning metrics with human judgment. Source code and datasets are available at https://shorturl.at/l83W2.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08163">DH-Mamba: Exploring Dual-domain Hierarchical State Space Models for MRI Reconstruction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Zhijian Song, Yonghong Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction poses a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the significant undersampling in k-space. Deep neural networks, such as CNNs and ViTs, have shown substantial performance improvements for this task while encountering the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation. To this end, this paper explores selective state space models (Mamba), a new paradigm for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, for efficient and effective MRI reconstruction. However, directly applying Mamba to MRI reconstruction faces three significant issues: (1) Mamba typically flattens 2D images into distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, disrupting k-space's unique spectrum and leaving its potential in k-space learning unexplored. (2) Existing approaches adopt multi-directional lengthy scanning to unfold images at the pixel level, leading to long-range forgetting and high computational burden. (3) Mamba struggles with spatially-varying contents, resulting in limited diversity of local representations. To address these, we propose a dual-domain hierarchical Mamba for MRI reconstruction from the following perspectives: (1) We pioneer vision Mamba in k-space learning. A circular scanning is customized for spectrum unfolding, benefiting the global modeling of k-space. (2) We propose a hierarchical Mamba with an efficient scanning strategy in both image and k-space domains. It mitigates long-range forgetting and achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and performance. (3) We develop a local diversity enhancement module to improve the spatially-varying representation of Mamba. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets for MRI reconstruction under various undersampling patterns. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Qu, Dian Chen, Xinyang Li, Xiaofan Li, Shengchuan Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18985">LoRA Subtraction for Drift-Resistant Space in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Liu, Xiaobin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In continual learning (CL), catastrophic forgetting often arises due to feature drift. This challenge is particularly prominent in the exemplar-free continual learning (EFCL) setting, where samples from previous tasks cannot be retained, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. To address this issue, some EFCL methods aim to identify feature spaces that minimize the impact on previous tasks while accommodating new ones. However, they rely on static features or outdated statistics stored from old tasks, which prevents them from capturing the dynamic evolution of the feature space in CL, leading to performance degradation over time. In this paper, we introduce the Drift-Resistant Space (DRS), which effectively handles feature drifts without requiring explicit feature modeling or the storage of previous tasks. A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called Low-Rank Adaptation Subtraction (LoRA-) is proposed to develop the DRS. This method subtracts the LoRA weights of old tasks from the initial pre-trained weight before processing new task data to establish the DRS for model training. Therefore, LoRA- enhances stability, improves efficiency, and simplifies implementation. Furthermore, stabilizing feature drifts allows for better plasticity by learning with a triplet loss. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, especially for long task sequences, across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lee Chae-Yeon, Oh Hyun-Bin, Han EunGi, Kim Sung-Bin, Suekyeong Nam, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-driven 3D talking head generation have made significant progress in lip synchronization. However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness -- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with our perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually accurate lip synchronization.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22159">Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting: Towards Faster and More Efficient Dynamic Scene Rendering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Feng, Hao Sun, Wei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes from 2D images presents significant challenges due to the spatial complexity and temporal variability of such scenes. Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Ye, Yushuang Wu, Ziteng Lu, Jiahao Chang, Xiaoyang Guo, Jiaqing Zhou, Hao Zhao, Xiaoguang Han</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing methods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing fine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent ambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal bridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal estimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise injection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp estimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation fidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality dataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work provides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images by leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.</p>
