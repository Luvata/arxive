<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Jalal Uddin Chowdhury, Zumana Islam Mou, Rezwana Afrin, Shafkat Kibria</p>
<p>Abstract: A very crucial part of Bangladeshi people's employment, GDP contribution, and mainly livelihood is agriculture. It plays a vital role in decreasing poverty and ensuring food security. Plant diseases are a serious stumbling block in agricultural production in Bangladesh. At times, humans can't detect the disease from an infected leaf with the naked eye. Using inorganic chemicals or pesticides in plants when it's too late leads in vain most of the time, deposing all the previous labor. The deep-learning technique of leaf-based image classification, which has shown impressive results, can make the work of recognizing and classifying all diseases trouble-less and more precise. In this paper, we've mainly proposed a better model for the detection of leaf diseases. Our proposed paper includes the collection of data on three different kinds of crops: bell peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. For training and testing the proposed CNN model, the plant leaf disease dataset collected from Kaggle is used, which has 17,430 images. The images are labeled with 14 separate classes of damage. The developed CNN model performs efficiently and could successfully detect and classify the tested diseases. The proposed CNN model may have great potency in crop disease management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanay Agrawal, Mohammed Guermal, Michal Balazia, Francois Bremond</p>
<p>Abstract: Challenges in cross-learning involve inhomogeneous or even inadequate amount of training data and lack of resources for retraining large pretrained models. Inspired by transfer learning techniques in NLP, adapters and prefix tuning, this paper presents a new model-agnostic plugin architecture for cross-learning, called CM3T, that adapts transformer-based models to new or missing information. We introduce two adapter blocks: multi-head vision adapters for transfer learning and cross-attention adapters for multimodal learning. Training becomes substantially efficient as the backbone and other plugins do not need to be finetuned along with these additions. Comparative and ablation studies on three datasets Epic-Kitchens-100, MPIIGroupInteraction and UDIVA v0.5 show efficacy of this framework on different recording settings and tasks. With only 12.8% trainable parameters compared to the backbone to process video input and only 22.3% trainable parameters for two additional modalities, we achieve comparable and even better results than the state-of-the-art. CM3T has no specific requirements for training or pretraining and is a step towards bridging the gap between a general model and specific practical applications of video classification.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03336">Mobile Augmented Reality Framework with Fusional Localization and Pose Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Hou, Fangzhou Lin, Yunmei Huang, Zhe Peng, Bin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: As a novel way of presenting information, augmented reality (AR) enables people to interact with the physical world in a direct and intuitive way. While there are some mobile AR products implemented with specific hardware at a high cost, the software approaches of AR implementation on mobile platforms(such as smartphones, tablet PC, etc.) are still far from practical use. GPS-based mobile AR systems usually perform poorly due to the inaccurate positioning in the indoor environment. Previous vision-based pose estimation methods need to continuously track predefined markers within a short distance, which greatly degrade user experience. This paper first conducts a comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art AR and localization systems on mobile platforms. Then, we propose an effective indoor mobile AR framework. In the framework, a fusional localization method and a new pose estimation implementation are developed to increase the overall matching rate and thus improving AR display accuracy. Experiments show that our framework has higher performance than approaches purely based on images or Wi-Fi signals. We achieve low average error distances (0.61-0.81m) and accurate matching rates (77%-82%) when the average sampling grid length is set to 0.5m.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03374">License Plate Images Generation with Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariia Shpir, Nadiya Shvai, Amir Nakib</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the evident practical importance of license plate recognition (LPR), corresponding research is limited by the volume of publicly available datasets due to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license plates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and video generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained on a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for detailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the generated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as success rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions include experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP synthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data. Furthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP images, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102. Conducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for the LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained with real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with pseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3% compared to baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Wang, Ziang Cheng, Zhenyu Li, Jiayu Yang, Haorui Ji, Pan Ji, Mehrtash Harandi, Richard Hartley, Hongdong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes DoubleDiffusion, a novel framework that combines heat dissipation diffusion and denoising diffusion for direct generative learning on 3D mesh surfaces. Our approach addresses the challenges of generating continuous signal distributions residing on a curve manifold surface. Unlike previous methods that rely on unrolling 3D meshes into 2D or adopting field representations, DoubleDiffusion leverages the Laplacian-Beltrami operator to process features respecting the mesh structure. This combination enables effective geometry-aware signal diffusion across the underlying geometry. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:teaser}, we demonstrate that DoubleDiffusion has the ability to generate RGB signal distributions on complex 3D mesh surfaces and achieves per-category shape-conditioned texture generation across different shape geometry. Our work contributes a new direction in diffusion-based generative modeling on 3D surfaces, with potential applications in the field of 3D asset generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soonbin Lee, Fangwen Shu, Yago Sanchez, Thomas Schierl, Cornelius Hellge</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is a recognized method for 3D scene representation, known for its high rendering quality and speed. However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

Yuille, Zongwei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Building trusted datasets is critical for transparent and responsible Medical AI (MAI) research, but creating even small, high-quality datasets can take years of effort from multidisciplinary teams. This process often delays AI benefits, as human-centric data creation and AI-centric model development are treated as separate, sequential steps. To overcome this, we propose ScaleMAI, an agent of AI-integrated data curation and annotation, allowing data quality and AI performance to improve in a self-reinforcing cycle and reducing development time from years to months. We adopt pancreatic tumor detection as an example. First, ScaleMAI progressively creates a dataset of 25,362 CT scans, including per-voxel annotations for benign/malignant tumors and 24 anatomical structures. Second, through progressive human-in-the-loop iterations, ScaleMAI provides Flagship AI Model that can approach the proficiency of expert annotators (30-year experience) in detecting pancreatic tumors. Flagship Model significantly outperforms models developed from smaller, fixed-quality datasets, with substantial gains in tumor detection (+14%), segmentation (+5%), and classification (72%) on three prestigious benchmarks. In summary, ScaleMAI transforms the speed, scale, and reliability of medical dataset creation, paving the way for a variety of impactful, data-driven applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03469">Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization for Self-Supervised Image Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Niu, Wenjun Xia, Hongming Shan, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a crucial technique in image processing, encoding, and understanding, especially for developing today's vision foundation models that utilize large-scale datasets without annotations to enhance various downstream tasks. This study introduces a novel SSL approach, Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization (IMSVD), for image representation learning. Specifically, IMSVD softly discretizes each variable in the latent space, enabling the estimation of their probability distributions over training batches and allowing the learning process to be directly guided by information measures. Motivated by the MultiView assumption, we propose an information-theoretic objective function to learn transform-invariant, non-travail, and redundancy-minimized representation features. We then derive a joint-cross entropy loss function for self-supervised image representation learning, which theoretically enjoys superiority over the existing methods in reducing feature redundancy. Notably, our non-contrastive IMSVD method statistically performs contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMSVD on various downstream tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Thanks to our variable discretization, the embedding features optimized by IMSVD offer unique explainability at the variable level. IMSVD has the potential to be adapted to other learning paradigms.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03482">VOILA: Complexity-Aware Universal Segmentation of CT images by Voxel Interacting with Language</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Wan, Yu Gao, Wanyuan Pang, Dawei Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Satisfactory progress has been achieved recently in universal segmentation of CT images. Following the success of vision-language methods, there is a growing trend towards utilizing text prompts and contrastive learning to develop universal segmentation models. However, there exists a significant imbalance in information density between 3D images and text prompts. Moreover, the standard fully connected layer segmentation approach faces significant challenges in handling multiple classes and exhibits poor generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the VOxel Interacting with LAnguage method (VOILA) for universal CT image segmentation. Initially, we align voxels and language into a shared representation space and classify voxels on the basis of cosine similarity. Subsequently, we develop the Voxel-Language Interaction framework to mitigate the impact of class imbalance caused by foreground-background discrepancies and variations in target volumes. Furthermore, a Complexity-Aware Sampling method is proposed to focus on region hard to segment, achieved by generating pseudo-heatmaps from a trainable Gaussian mixture distribution. Our results indicate the proposed VOILA is capable to achieve improved performance with reduced parameters and computational cost during training. Furthermore, it demonstrates significant generalizability across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shang Chai, Zihang Lin, Min Zhou, Xubin Li, Liansheng Zhuang, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the demand for personalizing image generation, subject-driven text-to-image generation method, which creates novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts, has received growing research interest. Existing methods often learn subject representation and incorporate it into the prompt embedding to guide image generation, but they struggle with preserving subject fidelity. To solve this issue, this paper approaches a novel framework named SceneBooth for subject-preserved text-to-image generation, which consumes inputs of a subject image, object phrases and text prompts. Instead of learning the subject representation and generating a subject, our SceneBooth fixes the given subject image and generates its background image guided by the text prompts. To this end, our SceneBooth introduces two key components, i.e., a multimodal layout generation module and a background painting module. The former determines the position and scale of the subject by generating appropriate scene layouts that align with text captions, object phrases, and subject visual information. The latter integrates two adapters (ControlNet and Gated Self-Attention) into the latent diffusion model to generate a background that harmonizes with the subject guided by scene layouts and text descriptions. In this manner, our SceneBooth ensures accurate preservation of the subject's appearance in the output. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that SceneBooth significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of subject preservation, image harmonization and overall quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Xu, Qingnan Fan, Fei Kou, Shuai Qin, Hong Gu, Ruoyu Zhao, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prompt, a pair of before-and-after edited images, can convey indescribable imagery transformations and prosper in image editing. However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritisha Sarkar, Duranta Durbaar Vishal Saha, Mousumi Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: Our research presents a comprehensive approach to leveraging mobile camera image data for real-time air quality assessment and recommendation. We develop a regression-based Convolutional Neural Network model and tailor it explicitly for air quality prediction by exploiting the inherent relationship between output parameters. As a result, the Mean Squared Error of 0.0077 and 0.0112 obtained for 2 and 5 pollutants respectively outperforms existing models. Furthermore, we aim to verify the common practice of augmenting the original dataset with a view to introducing more variation in the training phase. It is one of our most significant contributions that our experimental results demonstrate minimal accuracy differences between the original and augmented datasets. Finally, a real-time, user-friendly dashboard is implemented which dynamically displays the Air Quality Index and pollutant values derived from captured mobile camera images. Users' health conditions are considered to recommend whether a location is suitable based on current air quality metrics. Overall, this research contributes to verification of data augmentation techniques, CNN-based regression modelling for air quality prediction, and user-centric air quality monitoring through mobile technology. The proposed system offers practical solutions for individuals to make informed environmental health and well-being decisions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03507">An Empirical Study of Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoff and Training Efficiency in Self-Supervised Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Ghofrani, Pooyan Jamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced image representation learning, yet efficiency challenges persist, particularly with adversarial training. Many SSL methods require extensive epochs to achieve convergence, a demand further amplified in adversarial settings. To address this inefficiency, we revisit the robust EMP-SSL framework, emphasizing the importance of increasing the number of crops per image to accelerate learning. Unlike traditional contrastive learning, robust EMP-SSL leverages multi-crop sampling, integrates an invariance term and regularization, and reduces training epochs, enhancing time efficiency. Evaluated with both standard linear classifiers and multi-patch embedding aggregation, robust EMP-SSL provides new insights into SSL evaluation strategies.
  Our results show that robust crop-based EMP-SSL not only accelerates convergence but also achieves a superior balance between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, outperforming multi-crop embedding aggregation. Additionally, we extend this approach with free adversarial training in Multi-Crop SSL, introducing the Cost-Free Adversarial Multi-Crop Self-Supervised Learning (CF-AMC-SSL) method. CF-AMC-SSL demonstrates the effectiveness of free adversarial training in reducing training time while simultaneously improving clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. These findings underscore the potential of CF-AMC-SSL for practical SSL applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/softsys4ai/CF-AMC-SSL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alakh Aggarwal, Ningna Wang, Xiaohu Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D models of dynamic, real-world objects with high-fidelity textures from monocular frame sequences has been a challenging problem in recent years. This difficulty stems from factors such as shadows, indirect illumination, and inaccurate object-pose estimations due to occluding hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that predicts the hand's impact on environmental visibility and indirect illumination on the object's surface albedo. Our method first learns the geometry and low-fidelity texture of the object, hand, and background through composite rendering of radiance fields. Simultaneously, we optimize the hand and object poses to achieve accurate object-pose estimations. We then refine physics-based rendering parameters - including roughness, specularity, albedo, hand visibility, skin color reflections, and environmental illumination - to produce precise albedo, and accurate hand illumination and shadow regions. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in texture reconstruction and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to account for hand-object interactions in object texture reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a progress recognition method consider occlusion using deep metric learning is proposed to visualize the product assembly process in a factory. First, the target assembly product is detected from images acquired from a fixed-point camera installed in the factory using a deep learning-based object detection method. Next, the detection area is cropped from the image. Finally, by using a classification method based on deep metric learning on the cropped image, the progress of the product assembly work is estimated as a rough progress step.
  As a specific progress estimation model, we propose an Anomaly Triplet-Net that adds anomaly samples to Triplet Loss for progress estimation considering occlusion.
  In experiments, an 82.9% success rate is achieved for the progress estimation method using Anomaly Triplet-Net.
  We also experimented with the practicality of the sequence of detection, cropping, and progression estimation, and confirmed the effectiveness of the overall system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhi Yuan, Xinfeng Li, Chejian Xu, Guanhong Tao, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Wei Dong, Yang Liu, XiaoFeng Wang, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been shown to be vulnerable to misuse, particularly in generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 7.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03565">Bridged Semantic Alignment for Zero-shot 3D Medical Image Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Lai, Zihang Jiang, Qingsong Yao, Rongsheng Wang, Zhiyang He, Xiaodong Tao, Wei Wei, Weifu Lv, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D medical images such as Computed tomography (CT) are widely used in clinical practice, offering a great potential for automatic diagnosis. Supervised learning-based approaches have achieved significant progress but rely heavily on extensive manual annotations, limited by the availability of training data and the diversity of abnormality types. Vision-language alignment (VLA) offers a promising alternative by enabling zero-shot learning without additional annotations. However, we empirically discover that the visual and textural embeddings after alignment endeavors from existing VLA methods form two well-separated clusters, presenting a wide gap to be bridged. To bridge this gap, we propose a Bridged Semantic Alignment (BrgSA) framework. First, we utilize a large language model to perform semantic summarization of reports, extracting high-level semantic information. Second, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Interaction (CMKI) module that leverages a cross-modal knowledge bank as a semantic bridge, facilitating interaction between the two modalities, narrowing the gap, and improving their alignment. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark dataset that includes 15 underrepresented abnormalities as well as utilize two existing benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that BrgSA achieves state-of-the-art performances on both public benchmark datasets and our custom-labeled dataset, with significant improvements in zero-shot diagnosis of underrepresented abnormalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Cui, Jinbin Bai, Guohua Wang, Qingguo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating image captions typically relies on reference captions, which are costly to obtain and exhibit significant diversity and subjectivity. While reference-free evaluation metrics have been proposed, most focus on cross-modal evaluation between captions and images. Recent research has revealed that the modality gap generally exists in the representation of contrastive learning-based multi-modal systems, undermining the reliability of cross-modality metrics like CLIPScore. In this paper, we propose CAMScore, a cyclic reference-free automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. To circumvent the aforementioned modality gap, CAMScore utilizes a text-to-image model to generate images from captions and subsequently evaluates these generated images against the original images. Furthermore, to provide fine-grained information for a more comprehensive evaluation, we design a three-level evaluation framework for CAMScore that encompasses pixel-level, semantic-level, and objective-level perspectives. Extensive experiment results across multiple benchmark datasets show that CAMScore achieves a superior correlation with human judgments compared to existing reference-based and reference-free metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physical AI needs to be trained digitally first. It needs a digital twin of itself, the policy model, and a digital twin of the world, the world model. In this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We position a world foundation model as a general-purpose world model that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our platform covers a video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models, examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video tokenizers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Feng, Lu Wen, Yuanyuan Xu, Binyu Yan, Xi Wu, Jiliu Zhou, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown notable potential in relieving the heavy demand of dense prediction tasks on large-scale well-annotated datasets, especially for the challenging multi-organ segmentation (MoS). However, the prevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS caused by the substantial variations in organ size exacerbates the learning difficulty of the SSL network. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative semi-supervised network with BAlanced Subclass regularIzation and semantic-Conflict penalty mechanism (BASIC) to effectively learn the unbiased knowledge for semi-supervised MoS. Concretely, we construct a novel auxiliary subclass segmentation (SCS) task based on priorly generated balanced subclasses, thus deeply excavating the unbiased information for the main MoS task with the fashion of multi-task learning. Additionally, based on a mean teacher framework, we elaborately design a balanced subclass regularization to utilize the teacher predictions of SCS task to supervise the student predictions of MoS task, thus effectively transferring unbiased knowledge to the MoS subnetwork and alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem. Considering the similar semantic information inside the subclasses and their corresponding original classes (i.e., parent classes), we devise a semantic-conflict penalty mechanism to give heavier punishments to the conflicting SCS predictions with wrong parent classes and provide a more accurate constraint to the MoS predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets, i.e., the WORD dataset and the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset, have verified the superior performance of our proposed BASIC compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Yang, Hengyu Liu, Chenxin Li, Yining Sun, Wuyang Li, Yifan Liu, Yiyang Lin, Yixuan Yuan, Nanyang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, the widespread distribution of 3D data has become a future trend. While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongxuan Zhang, Bi Zeng, Xinyu Ni, Yimin Du</p>
<p>Abstract: RGB-T tracking leverages the complementary strengths of RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modalities to address challenging scenarios such as low illumination and adverse weather. However, existing methods often fail to effectively integrate temporal information and perform efficient cross-modal interactions, which constrain their adaptability to dynamic targets. In this paper, we propose BTMTrack, a novel framework for RGB-T tracking. The core of our approach lies in the dual-template backbone network and the Temporal-Modal Candidate Elimination (TMCE) strategy. The dual-template backbone effectively integrates temporal information, while the TMCE strategy focuses the model on target-relevant tokens by evaluating temporal and modal correlations, reducing computational overhead and avoiding irrelevant background noise. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Temporal Dual Template Bridging (TDTB) module, which facilitates precise cross-modal fusion through dynamically filtered tokens. This approach further strengthens the interaction between templates and the search region. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BTMTrack. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 72.3% precision rate on the LasHeR test set and competitive results on RGBT210 and RGBT234 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurin Jonientz, Johannes Merkle, Christian Rathgeb, Benjamin Tams, Georg Merz</p>
<p>Abstract: The assessment of face image quality is crucial to ensure reliable face recognition. In order to provide data subjects and operators with explainable and actionable feedback regarding captured face images, relevant quality components have to be measured. Quality components that are known to negatively impact the utility of face images include JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression artefacts, among others. Compression can result in a loss of important image details which may impair the recognition performance. In this work, deep neural networks are trained to detect the compression artefacts in a face images. For this purpose, artefact-free facial images are compressed with the JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression algorithms. Subsequently, the PSNR and SSIM metrics are employed to obtain training labels based on which neural networks are trained using a single network to detect JPEG and JPEG 2000 artefacts, respectively. The evaluation of the proposed method shows promising results: in terms of detection accuracy, error rates of 2-3% are obtained for utilizing PSNR labels during training. In addition, we show that error rates of different open-source and commercial face recognition systems can be significantly reduced by discarding face images exhibiting severe compression artefacts. To minimize resource consumption, EfficientNetV2 serves as basis for the presented algorithm, which is available as part of the OFIQ software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxuan Li, Qing Xu, Xiangjian He, Ziyu Liu, Daokun Zhang, Ruili Wang, Rong Qu, Guoping Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid CNN-Transformer models are designed to combine the advantages of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to efficiently model both local information and long-range dependencies. However, most research tends to focus on integrating the spatial features of CNNs and Transformers, while overlooking the critical importance of channel features. This is particularly significant for model performance in low-quality medical image segmentation. Effective channel feature extraction can significantly enhance the model's ability to capture contextual information and improve its representation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer model, CFFormer, and introduce two modules: the Cross Feature Channel Attention (CFCA) module and the X-Spatial Feature Fusion (XFF) module. The model incorporates dual encoders, with the CNN encoder focusing on capturing local features and the Transformer encoder modeling global features. The CFCA module filters and facilitates interactions between the channel features from the two encoders, while the XFF module effectively reduces the significant semantic information differences in spatial features, enabling a smooth and cohesive spatial feature fusion. We evaluate our model across eight datasets covering five modalities to test its generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with particularly superior performance on datasets characterized by blurry boundaries and low contrast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsheng Luan, Guangyuan Li, Lei Zhao, Wei Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic try-on effects. They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which results in high training costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing a long inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of reference network or image encoder, then propose MC-VTON, enabling DiT to integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs by utilizing its intrinsic backbone. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1)Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2)Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3)Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters 0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4)Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, fewer inference steps, and fewer trainable parameters than baseline methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03631">Exploring Optimal Latent Trajetory for Zero-shot Image Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maomao Li, Yu Li, Yunfei Liu, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Editability and fidelity are two essential demands for text-driven image editing, which expects that the editing area should align with the target prompt and the rest should remain unchanged separately. The current cutting-edge editing methods usually obey an "inversion-then-editing" pipeline, where the source image is first inverted to an approximate Gaussian noise ${z}_T$, based on which a sampling process is conducted using the target prompt. Nevertheless, we argue that it is not a good choice to use a near-Gaussian noise as a pivot for further editing since it almost lost all structure fidelity. We verify this by a pilot experiment, discovering that some intermediate-inverted latents can achieve a better trade-off between editability and fidelity than the fully-inverted ${z}_T$. Based on this, we propose a novel editing paradigm dubbed ZZEdit, which gentlely strengthens the target guidance on a sufficient-for-editing while structure-preserving latent. Specifically, we locate such an editing pivot by searching the first point on the inversion trajectory which has larger response levels toward the target prompt than the source one. Then, we propose a ZigZag process to perform mild target guiding on this pivot, which fulfills denoising and inversion iteratively, approaching the target while still holding fidelity. Afterwards, to achieve the same number of inversion and denoising steps, we perform a pure sampling process under the target prompt. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of our ZZEdit in diverse image editing scenarios compared with the "inversion-then-editing" pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liu, Duanchu Wang, Haoran Gong, Chongyu Wang, Jihua Zhu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and analyzing the spatial semantics and structure of forests is essential for accurate forest resource monitoring and ecosystem research. However, the lack of large-scale and annotated datasets has limited the widespread use of advanced intelligent techniques in this field. To address this challenge, a fully automated synthetic data generation and processing framework based on the concepts of Digital Cousins and Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) is proposed, offering versatility and scalability to any size and platform. Using this process, we created the Boreal3D, the world's largest forest point cloud dataset. It includes 1000 highly realistic and structurally diverse forest plots across four different platforms, totaling 48,403 trees and over 35.3 billion points. Each point is labeled with semantic, instance, and viewpoint information, while each tree is described with structural parameters such as diameter, crown width, leaf area, and total volume. We designed and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the potential of Boreal3D in advancing fine-grained 3D forest structure analysis in real-world applications. The results demonstrate that with certain strategies, models pre-trained on synthetic data can significantly improve performance when applied to real forest datasets. Especially, the findings reveal that fine-tuning with only 20% of real-world data enables the model to achieve performance comparable to models trained exclusively on entire real-world data, highlighting the value and potential of our proposed framework. The Boreal3D dataset, and more broadly, the synthetic data augmentation framework, is poised to become a critical resource for advancing research in large-scale 3D forest scene understanding and structural parameter estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Yu, Yiqun Wang, Zhengda Lu, Jianwei Guo, Yong Li, Hongxing Qin, Xiaopeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current novel view synthesis tasks primarily rely on high-quality and clear images. However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Mahon</p>
<p>Abstract: Data complexity is an important concept in the natural sciences and related areas, but lacks a rigorous and computable definition. In this paper, we focus on a particular sense of complexity that is high if the data is structured in a way that could serve to communicate a message. In this sense, human speech, written language, drawings, diagrams and photographs are high complexity, whereas data that is close to uniform throughout or populated by random values is low complexity. We describe a general framework for measuring data complexity based on dividing the shortest description of the data into a structured and an unstructured portion, and taking the size of the former as the complexity score. We outline an application of this framework in statistical mechanics that may allow a more objective characterisation of the macrostate and entropy of a physical system. Then, we derive a more precise and computable definition geared towards human communication, by proposing local compositionality as an appropriate specific structure. We demonstrate experimentally that this method can distinguish meaningful signals from noise or repetitive signals in auditory, visual and text domains, and could potentially help determine whether an extra-terrestrial signal contained a message.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03674">Action Quality Assessment via Hierarchical Pose-guided Multi-stage Contrastive Regression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengshi Qi, Hao Ye, Jiaxuan Peng, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results. In addition, we introduce a newly-annotated FineDiving-Pose Dataset to improve the current low-quality human pose labels. In experiments, the results on FineDiving and MTL-AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in understanding single images, aided by numerous high-quality instruction datasets. However, multi-image reasoning tasks are still under-explored in the open-source community due to two main challenges: (1) scaling datasets with multiple correlated images and complex reasoning instructions is resource-intensive and maintaining quality is difficult, and (2) there is a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for multi-image tasks. To address these issues, we introduce SMIR, an efficient synthetic data-generation pipeline for multi-image reasoning, and a high-quality dataset generated using this pipeline. Our pipeline efficiently extracts highly correlated images using multimodal embeddings, combining visual and descriptive information and leverages open-source LLMs to generate quality instructions. Using this pipeline, we generated 160K synthetic training samples, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source solutions. Additionally, we present SMIR-BENCH, a novel multi-image reasoning evaluation benchmark comprising 200 diverse examples across 7 complex multi-image reasoning tasks. SMIR-BENCH is multi-turn and utilizes a VLM judge to evaluate free-form responses, providing a comprehensive assessment of model expressiveness and reasoning capability across modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMIR dataset by fine-tuning several open-source VLMs and evaluating their performance on SMIR-BENCH. Our results show that models trained on our dataset outperform baseline models in multi-image reasoning tasks up to 8% with a much more scalable data pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative frame interpolation, empowered by large-scale pre-trained video generation models, has demonstrated remarkable advantages in complex scenes. However, existing methods heavily rely on the generative model to independently infer the correspondences between input frames, an ability that is inadequately developed during pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG), to significantly enhance the model's motion awareness by integrating explicit motion guidance. Specifically we investigate two key questions: what can serve as an effective motion guidance, and how we can seamlessly embed this guidance into the generative model. For the first question, we reveal that the intermediate flow from flow-based interpolation models could efficiently provide task-oriented motion guidance. Regarding the second, we first obtain guidance-based representations of intermediate frames by warping input frames' representations using guidance, and then integrate them into the model at both latent and feature levels. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we train MoG on both real-world and animation datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that our MoG significantly outperforms the existing methods in both domains, achieving superior video quality and improved fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Zhang, Hyeung-Sik Choi, Dongwook Jung, Phan Huy Nam Anh, Sang-Ki Jeong, Zihao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a challenging task in autonomous systems due to the lack of explicit depth information in single-view images. Existing methods often depend on external depth estimators or expensive sensors, which increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose AuxDepthNet, an efficient framework for real-time monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on external depth maps or pre-trained depth models. AuxDepthNet introduces two key components: the Auxiliary Depth Feature (ADF) module, which implicitly learns depth-sensitive features to improve spatial reasoning and computational efficiency, and the Depth Position Mapping (DPM) module, which embeds depth positional information directly into the detection process to enable accurate object localization and 3D bounding box regression. Leveraging the DepthFusion Transformer architecture, AuxDepthNet globally integrates visual and depth-sensitive features through depth-guided interactions, ensuring robust and efficient detection. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that AuxDepthNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with $\text{AP}_{3D}$ scores of 24.72\% (Easy), 18.63\% (Moderate), and 15.31\% (Hard), and $\text{AP}_{\text{BEV}}$ scores of 34.11\% (Easy), 25.18\% (Moderate), and 21.90\% (Hard) at an IoU threshold of 0.7.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwoon Kwak, Joonsoo Kim, Jun Young Jeong, Won-Sik Cheong, Jihyong Oh, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in scene representation and neural rendering, with intense efforts focused on adapting it for dynamic scenes. Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lezhong Wang, Duc Minh Tran, Ruiqi Cui, Thomson TG, Manmohan Chandraker, Jeppe Revall Frisvad</p>
<p>Abstract: To perform image editing based on single-view, inverse physically based rendering, we present a method combining a learning-based approach with progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. We require only a single image while other inverse rendering methods based on the rendering equation require multiple views. In comparison to single-view methods that rely on neural renderers, our approach achieves more realistic light material interactions, accurate shadows, and global illumination. Furthermore, with optimized material properties and illumination, our method enables a variety of tasks, including physically based material editing, object insertion, and relighting. We also propose a method for material transparency editing that operates effectively without requiring full scene geometry. Compared with methods based on Stable Diffusion, our approach offers stronger interpretability and more realistic light refraction based on empirical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Guo, Deqian Yang, Dan Wang, Haochen Zhao, Yuan Li, Zhilin Sui, Tao Zhou, Lijun Zhang, Yanda Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pulmonary structures iscrucial in clinical diagnosis, disease study, and treatment planning. Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, but most require much labeled data for training. Consequently, developing precise segmentation methods that demand fewer labeled datasets is paramount in medical image analysis. The emergence of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, recently opened the door for universal computer vision tasks. Exploiting the generalization ability of these pre-trained foundation models on downstream tasks, such as segmentation, leads to unexpected performance with a relatively small amount of labeled data. However, exploring these models for pulmonary artery-vein segmentation is still limited. This paper proposes a novel framework called Language-guided self-adaptive Cross-Attention Fusion Framework. Our method adopts pre-trained CLIP as a strong feature extractor for generating the segmentation of 3D CT scans, while adaptively aggregating the cross-modality of text and image representations. We propose a s pecially designed adapter module to fine-tune pre-trained CLIP with a self-adaptive learning strategy to effectively fuse the two modalities of embeddings. We extensively validate our method on a local dataset, which is the largest pulmonary artery-vein CT dataset to date and consists of 718 labeled data in total. The experiments show that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Zanella, Cl\'ement Fuchs, Christophe De Vleeschouwer, Ismail Ben Ayed</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely leveraged to improve predictive performance. However, previous works on transductive or test-time adaptation (TTA) often make strong assumptions about the data distribution, such as the presence of all classes. Our work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios, and introduces a more realistic evaluation framework, including: (i) a variable number of effective classes for adaptation within a single batch, and (ii) non-i.i.d. batches of test samples in online adaptation settings. We provide comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate how current transductive or TTA methods for VLMs systematically compromise the models' initial zero-shot robustness across various realistic scenarios, favoring performance gains under advantageous assumptions about the test samples' distributions. Furthermore, we introduce StatA, a versatile method that could handle a wide range of deployment scenarios, including those with a variable number of effective classes at test time. Our approach incorporates a novel regularization term designed specifically for VLMs, which acts as a statistical anchor preserving the initial text-encoder knowledge, particularly in low-data regimes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Singh, Pepijn Van de Ven, Ciar\'an Eising, Patrick Denny</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance semantic segmentation across diverse image modalities. We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated fish documentation processes are in the near future expected to play an essential role in sustainable fisheries management and for addressing challenges of overfishing. In this paper, we present a novel and publicly available dataset named AutoFish designed for fine-grained fish analysis. The dataset comprises 1,500 images of 454 specimens of visually similar fish placed in various constellations on a white conveyor belt and annotated with instance segmentation masks, IDs, and length measurements. The data was collected in a controlled environment using an RGB camera. The annotation procedure involved manual point annotations, initial segmentation masks proposed by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and subsequent manual correction of the masks. We establish baseline instance segmentation results using two variations of the Mask2Former architecture, with the best performing model reaching an mAP of 89.15%. Additionally, we present two baseline length estimation methods, the best performing being a custom MobileNetV2-based regression model reaching an MAE of 0.62cm in images with no occlusion and 1.38cm in images with occlusion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinbin Yuan, ZhaoHui Zheng, Yuxuan Li, Xialei Liu, Li Liu, Xiang Li, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: While witnessed with rapid development, remote sensing object detection remains challenging for detecting high aspect ratio objects. This paper shows that large strip convolutions are good feature representation learners for remote sensing object detection and can detect objects of various aspect ratios well. Based on large strip convolutions, we build a new network architecture called Strip R-CNN, which is simple, efficient, and powerful. Unlike recent remote sensing object detectors that leverage large-kernel convolutions with square shapes, our Strip R-CNN takes advantage of sequential orthogonal large strip convolutions to capture spatial information. In addition, we enhance the localization capability of remote-sensing object detectors by decoupling the detection heads and equipping the localization head with strip convolutions to better localize the target objects. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, e.g., DOTA, FAIR1M, HRSC2016, and DIOR, show that our Strip R-CNN can largely improve previous works. Notably, our 30M model achieves 82.75% mAP on DOTA-v1.0, setting a new state-of-the-art record.Code is available at https://github.com/YXB-NKU/Strip-R-CNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyuan Li, Suyang Zhou, Jieping Kong, Lei Qi, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) identifies anomalies without needing training samples from the target dataset, essential for scenarios with privacy concerns or limited data. Vision-language models like CLIP show potential in ZSAD but have limitations: relying on manually crafted fixed textual descriptions or anomaly prompts is time-consuming and prone to semantic ambiguity, and CLIP struggles with pixel-level anomaly segmentation, focusing more on global semantics than local details. To address these limitations, We introduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language models. KAnoCLIP combines general knowledge from a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5) and fine-grained, image-specific knowledge from a Visual Question Answering system (Llama3) via Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning (KnPL). KnPL uses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts, removing the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization. KAnoCLIP includes the CLIP visual encoder with V-V attention (CLIP-VV), Bi-Directional Cross-Attention for Multi-Level Cross-Modal Interaction (Bi-CMCI), and Conv-Adapter. These components preserve local visual semantics, improve local cross-modal fusion, and align global visual features with textual information, enhancing pixel-level anomaly detection. KAnoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSAD across 12 industrial and medical datasets, demonstrating superior generalization compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduarda Caldeira, Guray Ozgur, Tahar Chettaoui, Marija Ivanovska, Fadi Boutros, Vitomir Struc, Naser Damer</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabeled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https: //github.com/gurayozgur/MADation</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been pivotal in various 2D image analysis tasks, including computer vision, image indexing and retrieval or semantic classification. Extending CNNs to 3D data such as point clouds and 3D meshes raises significant challenges since the very basic convolution and pooling operators need to be completely re-visited and re-defined in an appropriate manner to tackle irregular connectivity issues. In this paper, we introduce MeshConv3D, a 3D mesh-dedicated methodology integrating specialized convolution and face collapse-based pooling operators. MeshConv3D operates directly on meshes of arbitrary topology, without any need of prior re-meshing/conversion techniques. In order to validate our approach, we have considered a semantic classification task. The experimental results obtained on three distinct benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach makes it possible to achieve equivalent or superior classification results, while minimizing the related memory footprint and computational load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenkun Lu, Chaoyin She, Wei Wang, Qinghua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current medical image segmentation approaches have limitations in deeply exploring multi-scale information and effectively combining local detail textures with global contextual semantic information. This results in over-segmentation, under-segmentation, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we explore multi-scale feature representations from different perspectives, proposing a novel, lightweight, and multi-scale architecture (LM-Net) that integrates advantages of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance segmentation accuracy. LM-Net employs a lightweight multi-branch module to capture multi-scale features at the same level. Furthermore, we introduce two modules to concurrently capture local detail textures and global semantics with multi-scale features at different levels: the Local Feature Transformer (LFT) and Global Feature Transformer (GFT). The LFT integrates local window self-attention to capture local detail textures, while the GFT leverages global self-attention to capture global contextual semantics. By combining these modules, our model achieves complementarity between local and global representations, alleviating the problem of blurred segmentation boundaries in medical image segmentation. To evaluate the feasibility of LM-Net, extensive experiments have been conducted on three publicly available datasets with different modalities. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods, while only requiring 4.66G FLOPs and 5.4M parameters. These state-of-the-art results on three datasets with different modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed LM-Net for various medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekai Gu, Rui Yan, Jiahao Lu, Peng Li, Zhiyang Dou, Chenyang Si, Zhen Dong, Qifeng Liu, Cheng Lin, Ziwei Liu, Wenping Wang, Yuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or images. However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stylizing a dynamic scene based on an exemplar image is critical for various real-world applications, including gaming, filmmaking, and augmented and virtual reality. However, achieving consistent stylization across both spatial and temporal dimensions remains a significant challenge. Most existing methods are designed for static scenes and often require an optimization process for each style image, limiting their adaptability. We introduce ZDySS, a zero-shot stylization framework for dynamic scenes, allowing our model to generalize to previously unseen style images at inference. Our approach employs Gaussian splatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature vector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp. By applying style transfer on the learned feature vectors instead of the rendered feature map, we enhance spatio-temporal consistency across frames. Our method demonstrates superior performance and coherence over state-of-the-art baselines in tests on real-world dynamic scenes, making it a robust solution for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keonwoo Kim, Yeongjae Cho, Taebaek Hwang, Minsoo Jo, Sangdo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to text-only tasks but can also function as multimodal models across various modalities, including audio, images, and videos. In particular, research on 3D Large Multimodal Models (3D LMMs) is making notable strides, driven by the potential of processing higher-dimensional data like point clouds. However, upon closer examination, we find that the visual and textual content within each sample of existing training datasets lacks both high informational granularity and clarity, which serve as a bottleneck for precise cross-modal understanding. To address these issues, we propose CL3DOR, Contrastive Learning for 3D large multimodal models via Odds ratio on high-Resolution point clouds, designed to ensure greater specificity and clarity in both visual and textual content. Specifically, we increase the density of point clouds per object and construct informative hard negative responses in the training dataset to penalize unwanted responses. To leverage hard negative responses, we incorporate the odds ratio as an auxiliary term for contrastive learning into the conventional language modeling loss. CL3DOR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CL3DOR's key components through extensive experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, computational pathology has made significant progress in cancer diagnosis and subtyping. Tissue segmentation is a core challenge, essential for prognosis and treatment decisions. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the annotation requirement by using image-level labels instead of pixel-level ones. However, Class Activation Map (CAM)-based methods still suffer from low spatial resolution and unclear boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level superpixel correction algorithm that refines CAM boundaries using superpixel clustering and floodfill. Experimental results show that our method achieves great performance on breast cancer segmentation dataset with mIoU of 71.08%, significantly improving tumor microenvironment boundary delineation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhe Yang, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have significant potential in e-commerce, allowing customers to visualize garments on themselves. Existing image-based methods fall into two categories: those that directly warp garment-images onto person-images (explicit warping), and those using cross-attention to reconstruct given garments (implicit warping). Explicit warping preserves garment details but often produces unrealistic output, while implicit warping achieves natural reconstruction but struggles with fine details. We propose HYB-VITON, a novel approach that combines the advantages of each method and includes both a preprocessing pipeline for warped garments and a novel training option. These components allow us to utilize beneficial regions of explicitly warped garments while leveraging the natural reconstruction of implicit warping. A series of experiments demonstrates that HYB-VITON preserves garment details more faithfully than recent diffusion-based methods, while producing more realistic results than a state-of-the-art explicit warping method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Magic Mirror, a framework for generating identity-preserved videos with cinematic-level quality and dynamic motion. While recent advances in video diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in text-to-video generation, maintaining consistent identity while producing natural motion remains challenging. Previous methods either require person-specific fine-tuning or struggle to balance identity preservation with motion diversity. Built upon Video Diffusion Transformers, our method introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch facial feature extractor that captures both identity and structural features, (2) a lightweight cross-modal adapter with Conditioned Adaptive Normalization for efficient identity integration, and (3) a two-stage training strategy combining synthetic identity pairs with video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magic Mirror effectively balances identity consistency with natural motion, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics while requiring minimal parameters added.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fusang Wang, Hala Djeghim, Nathan Piasco, Moussab Bennehar, Luis Rold\~ao, Dzmitry Tsishkou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing the surrounding surface geometry from recorded driving sequences poses a significant challenge due to the limited image overlap and complex topology of urban environments. SoTA neural implicit surface reconstruction methods often struggle in such setting, either failing due to small vision overlap or exhibiting suboptimal performance in accurately reconstructing both the surface and fine structures. To address these limitations, we introduce CoStruction, a novel hybrid implicit surface reconstruction method tailored for large driving sequences with limited camera overlap. CoStruction leverages cross-representation uncertainty estimation to filter out ambiguous geometry caused by limited observations. Our method performs joint optimization of both radiance fields in addition to guided sampling achieving accurate reconstruction of large areas along with fine structures in complex urban scenarios. Extensive evaluation on major driving datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach in reconstructing large driving sequences with limited image overlap, outperforming concurrent SoTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngoc Dung Huynh, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Sunil Aryal, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an evolving research field aimed at enabling machines to answer questions about visual content by integrating image and language processing techniques such as feature extraction, object detection, text embedding, natural language understanding, and language generation. With the growth of multimodal data research, VQA has gained significant attention due to its broad applications, including interactive educational tools, medical image diagnosis, customer service, entertainment, and social media captioning. Additionally, VQA plays a vital role in assisting visually impaired individuals by generating descriptive content from images. This survey introduces a taxonomy of VQA architectures, categorizing them based on design choices and key components to facilitate comparative analysis and evaluation. We review major VQA approaches, focusing on deep learning-based methods, and explore the emerging field of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) that have demonstrated success in multimodal tasks like VQA. The paper further examines available datasets and evaluation metrics essential for measuring VQA system performance, followed by an exploration of real-world VQA applications. Finally, we highlight ongoing challenges and future directions in VQA research, presenting open questions and potential areas for further development. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the latest advancements and future</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satchel French, Faith Zhu, Amish Jain, Naimul Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated viewpoint classification in echocardiograms can help under-resourced clinics and hospitals in providing faster diagnosis and screening when expert technicians may not be available. We propose a novel approach towards echocardiographic viewpoint classification. We show that treating viewpoint classification as video classification rather than image classification yields advantage. We propose a CNN-GRU architecture with a novel temporal feature weaving method, which leverages both spatial and temporal information to yield a 4.33\% increase in accuracy over baseline image classification while using only four consecutive frames. The proposed approach incurs minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we publish the Neonatal Echocardiogram Dataset (NED), a professionally-annotated dataset providing sixteen viewpoints and associated echocardipgraphy videos to encourage future work and development in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Polaczek, Yuval Alaluf, Elad Richardson, Yael Vinker, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector graphics are essential in design, providing artists with a versatile medium for creating resolution-independent and highly editable visual content. Recent advancements in vision-language and diffusion models have fueled interest in text-to-vector graphics generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from over-parameterized outputs or treat the layered structure - a core feature of vector graphics - as a secondary goal, diminishing their practical use. Recognizing the importance of layered SVG representations, we propose NeuralSVG, an implicit neural representation for generating vector graphics from text prompts. Inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), NeuralSVG encodes the entire scene into the weights of a small MLP network, optimized using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To encourage a layered structure in the generated SVG, we introduce a dropout-based regularization technique that strengthens the standalone meaning of each shape. We additionally demonstrate that utilizing a neural representation provides an added benefit of inference-time control, enabling users to dynamically adapt the generated SVG based on user-provided inputs, all with a single learned representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that NeuralSVG outperforms existing methods in generating structured and flexible SVG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Yuan, Xiangtai Li, Tao Zhang, Zilong Huang, Shilin Xu, Shunping Ji, Yunhai Tong, Lu Qi, Jiashi Feng, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Naulakha, Shubham Gaur, Dhairya Lodha, Mehek Tulsyan, Utsav Kotecha</p>
<p>Abstract: Gesture recognition is a perceptual user interface, which is based on CV technology that allows the computer to interpret human motions as commands, allowing users to communicate with a computer without the use of hands, thus making the mouse and keyboard superfluous. Gesture recognition's main weakness is a light condition because gesture control is based on computer vision, which heavily relies on cameras. These cameras are used to interpret gestures in 2D and 3D, so the extracted information can vary depending on the source of light. The limitation of the system cannot work in a dark environment. A simple night vision camera can be used as our camera for motion capture as they also blast out infrared light which is not visible to humans but can be clearly seen with a camera that has no infrared filter this majorly overcomes the limitation of systems which cannot work in a dark environment. So, the video stream from the camera is fed into a Raspberry Pi which has a Python program running OpenCV module which is used for detecting, isolating and tracking the path of dynamic gesture, then we use an algorithm of machine learning to recognize the pattern drawn and accordingly control the GPIOs of the raspberry pi to perform some activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoyuan Xie, Lingdong Kong, Yuhao Dong, Chonghao Sima, Wenwei Zhang, Qi Alfred Chen, Ziwei Liu, Liang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked interest in their use for autonomous driving, particularly in generating interpretable driving decisions through natural language. However, the assumption that VLMs inherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanations for driving remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce DriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17 settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames, 20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream driving tasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs. Our findings reveal that VLMs often generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modal reasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading to inconsistencies in performance. To address these challenges, we propose refined evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal understanding. Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs' awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap for developing more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems in real-world autonomous driving contexts. The benchmark toolkit is publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Hui Shuai, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu, Qingshan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR data pretraining offers a promising approach to leveraging large-scale, readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existing methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work, we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points. Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11 large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingdong Kong, Xiang Xu, Youquan Liu, Jun Cen, Runnan Chen, Wenwei Zhang, Liang Pan, Kai Chen, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach delivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on eleven large-scale multi-modal datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating the adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Fei, Shengqiong Wu, Wei Ji, Hanwang Zhang, Meishan Zhang, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research of video understanding still struggles to achieve in-depth comprehension and reasoning in complex videos, primarily due to the under-exploration of two key bottlenecks: fine-grained spatial-temporal perceptive understanding and cognitive-level video scene comprehension. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel solution. We first introduce a novel video Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), MotionEpic, which achieves fine-grained pixel-level spatial-temporal video grounding by integrating video spatial-temporal scene graph (STSG) representation. Building upon MotionEpic, we then develop a Video-of-Thought (VoT) reasoning framework. VoT inherits the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) core, breaking down a complex task into simpler and manageable sub-problems, and addressing them step-by-step from a low-level pixel perception to high-level cognitive interpretation. Extensive experiments across various complex video QA benchmarks demonstrate that our overall framework strikingly boosts existing state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at successfully implementing the CoT technique for achieving human-level video reasoning, where we show great potential in extending it to a wider range of video understanding scenarios.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03287">OpenLKA: an open dataset of lane keeping assist from market autonomous vehicles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Abdulaziz Alhuraish, Shengming Yuan, Shuyi Wang, Hao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent car models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network (CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse, challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather, degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM) further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving technology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road geometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset supports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and Chain of Thought reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyvan RahimiZadeh, Ahmad Taheri, Jan Baumbach, Esmael Makarian, Abbas Dehghani, Bahman Ravaei, Bahman Javadi, Amin Beheshti</p>
<p>Abstract: Lithology discrimination is a crucial activity in characterizing oil reservoirs, and processing lithology microscopic images is an essential technique for investigating fossils and minerals and geological assessment of shale oil exploration. In this way, Deep Learning (DL) technique is a powerful approach for building robust classifier models. However, there is still a considerable challenge to collect and produce a large dataset. Transfer-learning and data augmentation techniques have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this problem. Furthermore, due to different reasons, especially data privacy, individuals, organizations, and industry companies often are not willing to share their sensitive data and information. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to train a highly accurate central model across multiple decentralized edge servers without transferring sensitive data, preserving sensitive data, and enhancing security. This study involves two phases; the first phase is to conduct Lithology microscopic image classification on a small dataset using transfer learning. In doing so, various pre-trained DL model architectures are comprehensively compared for the classification task. In the second phase, we formulated the classification task to a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) scheme and proposed a Fine-Tuned Aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FTA-FTL). In order to perform a comprehensive experimental study, several metrics such as accuracy, f1 score, precision, specificity, sensitivity (recall), and confusion matrix are taken into account. The results are in excellent agreement and confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and show that the proposed FTA-FTL algorithm is capable enough to achieve approximately the same results obtained by the centralized implementation for Lithology microscopic images classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Hsiang Lin, Po-Wei Tang, Alfredo R. Huete</p>
<p>Abstract: A mangrove mapping (MM) algorithm is an essential classification tool for environmental monitoring. The recent literature shows that compared with other index-based MM methods that treat pixels as spatially independent, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for leveraging spatial continuity information, leading to improved classification performance. In this work, we go a step further to show that quantum features provide radically new information for CNN to further upgrade the classification results. Simply speaking, CNN computes affine-mapping features, while quantum neural network (QNN) offers unitary-computing features, thereby offering a fresh perspective in the final decision-making (classification). To address the challenging MM problem, we design an entangled spatial-spectral quantum feature extraction module. Notably, to ensure that the quantum features contribute genuinely novel information (unaffected by traditional CNN features), we design a separate network track consisting solely of quantum neurons with built-in interpretability. The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with traditional feature information to jointly make the final decision. The proposed quantum-empowered deep network (QEDNet) is very lightweight, so the improvement does come from the cooperation between CNN and QNN (rather than parameter augmentation). Extensive experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the superiority of QEDNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion bridges (DBs) are a class of diffusion models that enable faster sampling by interpolating between two paired image distributions. Training traditional DBs for image reconstruction requires high-quality reference images, which limits their applicability to settings where such references are unavailable. We propose SelfDB as a novel self-supervised method for training DBs directly on available noisy measurements without any high-quality reference images. SelfDB formulates the diffusion process by further sub-sampling the available measurements two additional times and training a neural network to reverse the corresponding degradation process by using the available measurements as the training targets. We validate SelfDB on compressed sensing MRI, showing its superior performance compared to the denoising diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray image based medical report generation achieves significant progress in recent years with the help of the large language model, however, these models have not fully exploited the effective information in visual image regions, resulting in reports that are linguistically sound but insufficient in describing key diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Liu, Yudong Zhang, Shuihua Wang, Siyue Li, Jin Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal vascular morphology is crucial for diagnosing diseases such as diabetes, glaucoma, and hypertension, making accurate segmentation of retinal vessels essential for early intervention. Traditional segmentation methods assume that training and testing data share similar distributions, which can lead to poor performance on unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices and patient demographics. This paper presents a novel approach, DGSSA, for retinal vessel image segmentation that enhances model generalization by combining structural and style augmentation strategies. We utilize a space colonization algorithm to generate diverse vascular-like structures that closely mimic actual retinal vessels, which are then used to generate pseudo-retinal images with an improved Pix2Pix model, allowing the segmentation model to learn a broader range of structure distributions. Additionally, we utilize PixMix to implement random photometric augmentations and introduce uncertainty perturbations, thereby enriching stylistic diversity and significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying imaging conditions. Our framework has been rigorously evaluated on four challenging datasets-DRIVE, CHASEDB, HRF, and STARE-demonstrating state-of-the-art performance that surpasses existing methods. This validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting its potential for clinical application in automated retinal vessel analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Binary Neural Network (BNN) converts full-precision weights and activations into their extreme 1-bit counterparts, making it particularly suitable for deployment on lightweight mobile devices. While binary neural networks are typically formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized in the binarized space, general neural networks are formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem and optimized in the continuous space. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network (HBNN) by leveraging the framework of hyperbolic geometry to optimize the constrained problem. Specifically, we transform the constrained problem in hyperbolic space into an unconstrained one in Euclidean space using the Riemannian exponential map. On the other hand, we also propose the Exponential Parametrization Cluster (EPC) method, which, compared to the Riemannian exponential map, shrinks the segment domain based on a diffeomorphism. This approach increases the probability of weight flips, thereby maximizing the information gain in BNNs. Experimental results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGGsmall, ResNet18, and ResNet34 models illustrate the superior performance of our HBNN over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men. The registration of magnetic resonance (MR) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) can provide guidance for the targeted biopsy of prostate cancer. In this study, we propose a salient region matching framework for fully automated MR-TRUS registration. The framework consists of prostate segmentation, rigid alignment and deformable registration. Prostate segmentation is performed using two segmentation networks on MR and TRUS respectively, and the predicted salient regions are used for the rigid alignment. The rigidly-aligned MR and TRUS images serve as initialization for the deformable registration. The deformable registration network has a dual-stream encoder with cross-modal spatial attention modules to facilitate multi-modality feature learning, and a salient region matching loss to consider both structure and intensity similarity within the prostate region. Experiments on a public MR-TRUS dataset demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory registration results, outperforming several cutting-edge methods.

<p>Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, missing modalities are commonly observed due to limitations in scan time, scan corruption, artifacts, motion, and contrast agent intolerance. Synthesis of missing MRI has been a means to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice and research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor generalization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model, the Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff), designed for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine Unified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of diffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into two stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images. Secondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses appropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a unified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid Mechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion model and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed FgC2F-UDiff model achieves superior performance on two datasets, validated through a comprehensive assessment that includes both qualitative observations and quantitative metrics, such as PSNR SSIM, LPIPS, and FID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greeshma K, Vishnukumar S</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, continues to be a major global health threat despite being preventable and curable. This burden is particularly high in low and middle income countries. Microscopy remains essential for diagnosing TB by enabling direct visualization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum smear samples, offering a cost effective approach for early detection and effective treatment. Given the labour-intensive nature of microscopy, automating the detection of bacilli in microscopic images is crucial to improve both the expediency and reliability of TB diagnosis. The current methodologies for detecting tuberculosis bacilli in bright field microscopic sputum smear images are hindered by limited automation capabilities, inconsistent segmentation quality, and constrained classification precision. This paper proposes a twostage deep learning methodology for tuberculosis bacilli detection, comprising bacilli segmentation followed by classification. In the initial phase, an advanced U-Net model employing attention blocks and residual connections is proposed to segment microscopic sputum smear images, enabling the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs). The extracted ROIs are then classified using a Vision Transformer, which we specifically customized as TBViT to enhance the precise detection of bacilli within the images. For the experiments, a newly developed dataset of microscopic sputum smear images derived from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides is used in conjunction with existing public datasets. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the experiments using various metrics demonstrates that the proposed model achieves significantly improved segmentation performance, higher classification accuracy, and a greater level of automation, surpassing existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a critical global health issue, necessitating timely diagnosis and treatment. Current methods for detecting tuberculosis bacilli from bright field microscopic sputum smear images suffer from low automation, inadequate segmentation performance, and limited classification accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient hybrid approach that combines deep learning for segmentation and an ensemble model for classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjia Wang, Bo Xiong, You Zhou, Xun Cao, Zhan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of virtual staining technology provides a rapid and efficient alternative for researchers in tissue pathology. It enables the utilization of unlabeled microscopic samples to generate virtual replicas of chemically stained histological slices, or facilitate the transformation of one staining type into another. The remarkable performance of generative networks, such as CycleGAN, offers an unsupervised learning approach for virtual coloring, overcoming the limitations of high-quality paired data required in supervised learning. Nevertheless, large-scale color transformation necessitates processing large field-of-view images in patches, often resulting in significant boundary inconsistency and artifacts. Additionally, the transformation between different colorized modalities typically needs further efforts to modify loss functions and tune hyperparameters for independent training of networks. In this study, we introduce a general virtual staining framework that is adaptable to various conditions. We propose a loss function based on the value mapping constraint to ensure the accuracy of virtual coloring between different pathological modalities, termed the Value Mapping Generative Adversarial Network (VM-GAN). Meanwhile, we present a confidence-based tiling method to address the challenge of boundary inconsistency arising from patch-wise processing. Experimental results on diverse data with varying staining protocols demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative indicators and improved visual perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengnan Sun, Zhaotai Shi, Jiayin Chen, Qingtao Liu, Yu Cui, Qi Ye, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual dexterous manipulation remains significant challenges in robotics due to the high DoFs of each hand and their coordination. Existing single-hand manipulation techniques often leverage human demonstrations to guide RL methods but fail to generalize to complex bimanual tasks involving multiple sub-skills. In this paper, we introduce VTAO-BiManip, a novel framework that combines visual-tactile-action pretraining with object understanding to facilitate curriculum RL to enable human-like bimanual manipulation. We improve prior learning by incorporating hand motion data, providing more effective guidance for dual-hand coordination than binary tactile feedback. Our pretraining model predicts future actions as well as object pose and size using masked multimodal inputs, facilitating cross-modal regularization. To address the multi-skill learning challenge, we introduce a two-stage curriculum RL approach to stabilize training. We evaluate our method on a bottle-cap unscrewing task, demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach achieves a success rate that surpasses existing visual-tactile pretraining methods by over 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Qi Wang, Jian Sun, Zhijie Wen, Jun Shi, Shihui Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon W. Penninga, Hans van Gorp, Ruud J. G. van Sloun</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound images are commonly formed by sequential acquisition of beam-steered scan-lines. Minimizing the number of required scan-lines can significantly enhance frame rate, field of view, energy efficiency, and data transfer speeds. Existing approaches typically use static subsampling schemes in combination with sparsity-based or, more recently, deep-learning-based recovery. In this work, we introduce an adaptive subsampling method that maximizes intrinsic information gain in-situ, employing a Sylvester Normalizing Flow encoder to infer an approximate Bayesian posterior under partial observation in real-time. Using the Bayesian posterior and a deep generative model for future observations, we determine the subsampling scheme that maximizes the mutual information between the subsampled observations, and the next frame of the video. We evaluate our approach using the EchoNet cardiac ultrasound video dataset and demonstrate that our active sampling method outperforms competitive baselines, including uniform and variable-density random sampling, as well as equidistantly spaced scan-lines, improving mean absolute reconstruction error by 15%. Moreover, posterior inference and the sampling scheme generation are performed in just 0.015 seconds (66Hz), making it fast enough for real-time 2D ultrasound imaging applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runci Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitive and psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrence of seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health. The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracy in object detection for medical imaging. In this paper, we develop a novel SCC-YOLO architecture by integrating the SCConv attention mechanism into YOLOv9. The SCConv module reconstructs an efficient convolutional module by reducing spatial and channel redundancy among features, thereby enhancing the learning of image features. We investigate the impact of intergrating different attention mechanisms with the YOLOv9 model on brain tumor image detection using both the Br35H dataset and our self-made dataset(Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Experimental results show that on the Br35H dataset, SCC-YOLO achieved a 0.3% improvement in mAp50 compared to YOLOv9, while on our self-made dataset, SCC-YOLO exhibited a 0.5% improvement over YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO has reached state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection. Source code is available at : https://jihulab.com/healthcare-information-studio/SCC-YOLO/-/tree/master</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadya Arora, Vinay Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: With the popularity of foundational models, parameter efficient fine tuning has become the defacto approach to leverage pretrained models to perform downstream tasks. Taking inspiration from recent advances in large language models, Visual Prompt Tuning, and similar techniques, learn an additional prompt to efficiently finetune a pretrained vision foundational model. However, we observe that such prompting is insufficient for fine-grained visual classification tasks such as medical image classification, where there is large inter-class variance, and small intra-class variance. Hence, in this paper we propose to leverage advanced segmentation capabilities of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) as a visual prompting cue to help visual encoder in the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) by guiding the attention in CLIP visual encoder to relevant regions in the image. This helps the model to focus on highly discriminative regions, without getting distracted from visually similar background features, an essential requirement in a fewshot, finegrained classification setting. We evaluate our method on diverse medical datasets including X-rays, CT scans, and MRI images, and report an accuracy of (71%, 81%, 86%, 58%) from the proposed approach on (COVID, lung-disease, brain-tumor, breast-cancer) datasets against (66%, 70%, 68%, 29%) from a pretrained CLIP model after fewshot training. The proposed approach also allows to obtain interpretable explanation for the classification performance through the localization obtained using segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Zhang, Timothy Shea, Arto Nurmikko</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments in tissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissues with cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale data analysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers to rapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diverse biological samples. Segmentation, a crucial preliminary step in the analysis process, can be automated using domain-specific deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, these models exhibit high sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to data outside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizable models, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference. SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice and human brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and 315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and final testing. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, including vessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases of the challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper. Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstrate that self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation model performance and generalization. We will continue to support and extend SELMA3D as an inaugural MICCAI challenge focused on self-supervised learning for 3D microscopy image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, the first closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build the entire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate research ideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results to generate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with the exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideas continuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Usman, Olga Varea, Petia Radeva, Josep Canals, Jordi Abante, Daniel Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are complex and lack effective treatment due to their poorly understood mechanism. The increasingly used data analysis from Single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows to explore transcriptomic events at a single cell level, yet face challenges in interpreting the mechanisms underlying a disease. On the other hand, Neural Network (NN) models can handle complex data to offer insights but can be seen as black boxes with poor interpretability. In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach. Our results show that DGE and SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genes and pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broader perspective of disease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models integrating textual and visual inputs have introduced new possibilities for interpreting complex data. Despite their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on visual stimuli, the alignment of these models with human perception in identifying relevant elements in images requires further exploration. This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alzayat Saleh, Marcus Sheaves, Dean Jerry, Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in deep learning-based underwater image enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data. Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative as well as qualitative metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Wang, Ziao Li, Bangli Liu, Haibin Cai, Mohamad Saada, Qinggang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the significant achievements have been made in skeleton-based human action recognition with the emergence of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models used for this task focus on constructing more complex higher-order connections between joint nodes to describe skeleton information, which leads to complex inference processes and high computational costs. To address the slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, we introduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs and propose two novel high-performance inference GCNs, namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. After the completion of model training, model parameters are fixed. HPI-GCN-RP adopts re-parameterization technique to transform high-performance training model into fast inference model through linear transformations, which achieves a higher inference speed with competitive model performance. HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to achieve higher performance improvement by introducing additional inference parameters, albeit with slightly decreased inference speed. The experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves performance comparable to the current SOTA models, with inference speeds five times faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Lu, Xinzhu Ma, Lei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Yating Liu, Qi Chu, Tong He, Yonghui Li, Wanli Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry plays a significant role in monocular 3D object detection. It can be used to estimate object depth by using the perspective projection between object's physical size and 2D projection in the image plane, which can introduce mathematical priors into deep models. However, this projection process also introduces error amplification, where the error of the estimated height is amplified and reflected into the projected depth. It leads to unreliable depth inferences and also impairs training stability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network (GUPNet++) by modeling geometry projection in a probabilistic manner. This ensures depth predictions are well-bounded and associated with a reasonable uncertainty. The significance of introducing such geometric uncertainty is two-fold: (1). It models the uncertainty propagation relationship of the geometry projection during training, improving the stability and efficiency of the end-to-end model learning. (2). It can be derived to a highly reliable confidence to indicate the quality of the 3D detection result, enabling more reliable detection inference. Experiments show that the proposed approach not only obtains (state-of-the-art) SOTA performance in image-based monocular 3D detection but also demonstrates superiority in efficacy with a simplified framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiankun Liu, Yichen Li, Yuqi Jiang, Ying Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to detect and track the dynamic objects in different scenes is fundamental to real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin. Codes are avaliable at \url{https://github.com/yumu-173/Siamese-DETR}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghwan Kim, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aziliz Guezou-Philippe, Arnaud Clav\'e, Ehouarn Maguet, Ludivine Maintier, Charles Garraud, Jean-Rassaire Fouefack, Val\'erie Burdin, Eric Stindel, Guillaume Dardenne</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Osteoarthritis affects about 528 million people worldwide, causing pain and stiffness in the joints. Arthroplasty is commonly performed to treat joint osteoarthritis, reducing pain and improving mobility. Nevertheless, a significant share of patients remain unsatisfied with their surgery. Personalised arthroplasty was introduced to improve surgical outcomes however current solutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine. We propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants for total knee arthroplasty.
  Methods. The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the femur and tibia proximal and distal extremities. Then the full bones are reconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and landmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to design patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained on 91 CT scans and evaluated on 41 CT scans, in terms of accuracy and execution time.
  Results. The workflow accuracy was $0.4\pm0.2mm$ for segmentation, $1.0\pm0.3mm$ for full bone reconstruction, and $2.2\pm1.5mm$ for anatomical landmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with $0.9\pm0.5mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design lasted about 15 minutes.
  Conclusion. The proposed workflow performs a fast and reliable personalisation of knee implants, directly from a CT image without requiring any manual intervention. It allows the establishment of a patient-specific pre-operative planning in a very short time, making it easily available for all patients. Combined with efficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the growing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving patients' satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Tian, Ran Ji, Lingxiao Yang, Suting Ni, Yuexin Ma, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu, Ye Shi, Jingya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze plays a crucial role in revealing human attention and intention, particularly in hand-object interaction scenarios, where it guides and synchronizes complex tasks that require precise coordination between the brain, hand, and object. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task: Gaze-Guided Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis, with potential applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and assistive technologies. To support this task, we present GazeHOI, the first dataset to capture simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions. This task poses significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity and noise in gaze data, as well as the need for high consistency and physical plausibility in generating hand and object motions. To tackle these issues, we propose a stacked gaze-guided hand-object interaction diffusion model, named GHO-Diffusion. The stacked design effectively reduces the complexity of motion generation. We also introduce HOI-Manifold Guidance during the sampling stage of GHO-Diffusion, enabling fine-grained control over generated motions while maintaining the data manifold. Additionally, we propose a spatial-temporal gaze feature encoding for the diffusion condition and select diffusion results based on consistency scores between gaze-contact maps and gaze-interaction trajectories. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of our method and the unique contributions of our dataset. More details in https://takiee.github.io/gaze-hoi/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Lafage, Mathieu Barbier, Gianni Franchi, David Filliat</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Sun, Yuhang Liu, Xingxia Wang, Bin Tian, Long Chen, Fei-Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud data labeling is considered a time-consuming and expensive task in autonomous driving, whereas annotation-free learning training can avoid it by learning point cloud representations from unannotated data. In this paper, we propose AFOV, a novel 3D \textbf{A}nnotation-\textbf{F}ree framework assisted by 2D \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary segmentation models. It consists of two stages: In the first stage, we innovatively integrate high-quality textual and image features of 2D open-vocabulary models and propose the Tri-Modal contrastive Pre-training (TMP). In the second stage, spatial mapping between point clouds and images is utilized to generate pseudo-labels, enabling cross-modal knowledge distillation. Besides, we introduce the Approximate Flat Interaction (AFI) to address the noise during alignment and label confusion. To validate the superiority of AFOV, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple related datasets. We achieved a record-breaking 47.73\% mIoU on the annotation-free 3D segmentation task in nuScenes, surpassing the previous best model by 3.13\% mIoU. Meanwhile, the performance of fine-tuning with 1\% data on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI reached a remarkable 51.75\% mIoU and 48.14\% mIoU, outperforming all previous pre-trained models</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Lee, Xiaofeng Cao, Jingcai Guo, Wei Ye, Qing Guo, Yi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. To expand the usage scenarios of LLM, some works enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the model by introducing more external information, which is called the agent paradigm. Based on this idea, we propose a new method that integrates the agent paradigm into out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to improve its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Zhang, Shaogeng Liu, Kun Bian, You Zhou, Pei Zhang, Wenbo An, Jun Zhou, Kun Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, known as the Mamba deep learning models, have made significant progress in modeling long sequences such as language understanding. Therefore, building efficient and general-purpose visual backbones based on SSMs is a promising direction. Compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM) methods is not yet fully competitive. To enable SSMs to process image data, ViMs typically flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, inevitably ignoring some 2D local dependencies, thereby weakening the model's ability to interpret spatial relationships from a global perspective. We use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the spectrum of the feature map and add it to the original feature map, enabling ViM to model a unified visual representation in both frequency and spatial domains. The introduction of frequency domain information enables ViM to have a global receptive field during scanning. We propose a novel model called Vim-F, which employs pure Mamba encoders and scans in both the frequency and spatial domains. Moreover, we question the necessity of position embedding in ViM and remove it accordingly in Vim-F, which helps to fully utilize the efficient long-sequence modeling capability of ViM. Finally, we redesign a patch embedding for Vim-F, leveraging a convolutional stem to capture more local correlations, further improving the performance of Vim-F.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Chodosh, Anish Madan, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for dynamic surface reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes from LiDAR. Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stanislav Frolov, Brian B. Moser, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-resolution images with generative models has recently been made widely accessible by leveraging diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale datasets. Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and SyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training resolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple overlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain perceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous predictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless images. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that eliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising predictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time, ensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in coherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our method offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency and faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.

<p>Abstract: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Jiang, Sicheng Zhao, Jiankun Zhu, Wenbo Tang, Zhaopan Xu, Jidong Yang, Guoping Liu, Tengfei Xing, Pengfei Xu, Hongxun Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods for panoramic semantic segmentation utilize real pinhole images or low-cost synthetic panoramic images to transfer segmentation models to real panoramic images. However, these methods struggle to understand the panoramic structure using only real pinhole images and lack real-world scene perception with only synthetic panoramic images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new task, Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (MSDA4PASS), which leverages both real pinhole and synthetic panoramic images to improve segmentation on unlabeled real panoramic images. There are two key issues in the MSDA4PASS task: (1) distortion gaps between the pinhole and panoramic domains -- panoramic images exhibit global and local distortions absent in pinhole images; (2) texture gaps between the source and target domains -- scenes and styles differ across domains. To address these two issues, we propose a novel framework, Deformation Transform Aligner for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (DTA4PASS), which converts all pinhole images in the source domains into distorted images and aligns the source distorted and panoramic images with the target panoramic images. Specifically, DTA4PASS consists of two main components: Unpaired Semantic Morphing (USM) and Distortion Gating Alignment (DGA). First, in USM, the Dual-view Discriminator (DvD) assists in training the diffeomorphic deformation network at the image and pixel level, enabling the effective deformation transformation of pinhole images without paired panoramic views, alleviating distortion gaps. Second, DGA assigns pinhole-like (pin-like) and panoramic-like (pan-like) features to each image by gating, and aligns these two features through uncertainty estimation, reducing texture gaps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models for remote sensing have shown promising uses thanks to their extensive pretraining. However, their conventional usage in zero-shot scene classification methods still involves dividing large images into patches and making independent predictions, i.e., inductive inference, thereby limiting their effectiveness by ignoring valuable contextual information. Our approach tackles this issue by utilizing initial predictions based on text prompting and patch affinity relationships from the image encoder to enhance zero-shot capabilities through transductive inference, all without the need for supervision and at a minor computational cost. Experiments on 10 remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has shown significant advancements in computer vision to improve model performance over the years, particularly in scenarios with limited and insufficient data. Currently, most studies focus on adjusting the image or its features to expand the size, quality, and variety of samples during training in various tasks including object detection. However, we argue that it is necessary to investigate bounding box transformations as a data augmentation technique rather than image-level transformations, especially in aerial imagery due to potentially inconsistent bounding box annotations. Hence, this letter presents a thorough investigation of bounding box transformation in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation for remote sensing object detection. We call this augmentation strategy NBBOX (Noise Injection into Bounding Box). We conduct extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R, both well-known datasets that include a variety of rotated generic objects in aerial images. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves remote sensing object detection without whistles and bells and it is more time-efficient than other state-of-the-art augmentation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolution of digital image manipulation, particularly with the advancement of deep generative models, significantly challenges existing deepfake detection methods, especially when the origin of the deepfake is obscure. To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models. Our method showcases outstanding performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.749 for cross-data generalization and 0.893 for robustness against unseen deepfakes, outperforming all compared methods.

<p>Abstract: In the fields of affective computing (AC) and brain-machine interface (BMI), the analysis of physiological and behavioral signals to discern individual emotional states has emerged as a critical research frontier. While deep learning-based approaches have made notable strides in EEG emotion recognition, particularly in feature extraction and pattern recognition, significant challenges persist in achieving end-to-end emotion computation, including real-time processing, individual adaptation, and seamless user interaction. This paper presents the EEG Emotion Copilot, a system optimizing a lightweight large language model (LLM) with 0.5B parameters operating in a local setting, which first recognizes emotional states directly from EEG signals, subsequently generates personalized diagnostic and treatment suggestions, and finally supports the automation of assisted electronic medical records. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical techniques in the novel data structure of prompt, model pruning and fine-tuning training, and deployment strategies aiming at improving real-time performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our optimized lightweight LLM-based copilot achieves an enhanced intuitive interface for participant interaction, superior accuracy of emotion recognition and assisted electronic medical records generation, in comparison to such models with similar scale parameters or large-scale parameters such as 1.5B, 1.8B, 3B and 7B. In summary, through these efforts, the proposed copilot is expected to advance the application of AC in the medical domain, offering innovative solution to mental health monitoring.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16020">START: A Generalized State Space Model with Saliency-Driven Token-Aware Transformation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Liu, Yuanbi Nie, Yingshui Tan, Jiaheng Liu, Xiangyu Yue, Qiushi Cui, Chongjun Wang, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. M. A. Valiuddin, R. J. G. van Sloun, C. G. A. Viviers, P. H. N. de With, F. van der Sommen</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783">KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Zhijie Cai, Tingwei Chen, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhu, Xin Zou, Lei Liu, Zhangmin Huang, Ying Zhang, Chang Tang, Li-Rong Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering can partition data samples into their categories by learning a consensus representation in an unsupervised way and has received more and more attention in recent years. However, there is an untrusted fusion problem. The reasons for this problem are as follows: 1) The current methods ignore the presence of noise or redundant information in the view; 2) The similarity of contrastive learning comes from the same sample rather than the same cluster in deep multi-view clustering. It causes multi-view fusion in the wrong direction. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering network to address this problem, termed as Trusted Mamba Contrastive Network (TMCN). Specifically, we present a new Trusted Mamba Fusion Network (TMFN), which achieves a trusted fusion of multi-view data through a selective mechanism. Moreover, we align the fused representation and the view-specific representation using the Average-similarity Contrastive Learning (AsCL) module. AsCL increases the similarity of view presentation from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/TMCN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dejie Yang, Zijing Zhao, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subeen Lee, Jiyeon Han, Soyeon Kim, Jaesik Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but struggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their scarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent methods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce diversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes a novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image datasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization of latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing flows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation of diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and similarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs without retraining or fine-tuning the pretrained GANs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanpeng Tu, Hao Luo, Xi Chen, Sihui Ji, Xiang Bai, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video generation, inserting a given object into videos remains a challenging task. The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01595">Adaptive Homophily Clustering: Structure Homophily Graph Learning with Adaptive Filter for Hyperspectral Image</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Ding, Weijie Kang, Aitao Yang, Zhili Zhang, Junyang Zhao, Jie Feng, Danfeng Hong, Qinhe Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering has been a fundamental but challenging task with zero training labels. Currently, some deep graph clustering methods have been successfully explored for HSI due to their outstanding performance in effective spatial structural information encoding. Nevertheless, insufficient structural information utilization, poor feature presentation ability, and weak graph update capability limit their performance. Thus, in this paper, a homophily structure graph learning with an adaptive filter clustering method (AHSGC) for HSI is proposed. Specifically, homogeneous region generation is first developed for HSI processing and constructing the original graph. Afterward, an adaptive filter graph encoder is designed to adaptively capture the high and low frequency features on the graph for subsequence processing. Then, a graph embedding clustering self-training decoder is developed with KL Divergence, with which the pseudo-label is generated for network training. Meanwhile, homophily-enhanced structure learning is introduced to update the graph according to the clustering task, in which the orient correlation estimation is adopted to estimate the node connection, and graph edge sparsification is designed to adjust the edges in the graph dynamically. Finally, a joint network optimization is introduced to achieve network self-training and update the graph. The K-means is adopted to express the latent features. Extensive experiments and repeated comparative analysis have verified that our AHSGC contains high clustering accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Shisheng Guo, Longzhen Tang, Cuolong Cui, Lingjiang Kong, Xiaobo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote physiological signal measurement based on facial videos, also known as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), involves predicting changes in facial vascular blood flow from facial videos. While most deep learning-based methods have achieved good results, they often struggle to balance performance across small and large-scale datasets due to the inherent limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer. In this paper, we introduce VidFormer, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates 3-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) and Transformer models for rPPG tasks. Initially, we conduct an analysis of the traditional skin reflection model and subsequently introduce an enhanced model for the reconstruction of rPPG signals. Based on this improved model, VidFormer utilizes 3DCNN and Transformer to extract local and global features from input data, respectively. To enhance the spatiotemporal feature extraction capabilities of VidFormer, we incorporate temporal-spatial attention mechanisms tailored for both 3DCNN and Transformer. Additionally, we design a module to facilitate information exchange and fusion between the 3DCNN and Transformer. Our evaluation on five publicly available datasets demonstrates that VidFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Finally, we discuss the essential roles of each VidFormer module and examine the effects of ethnicity, makeup, and exercise on its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Jin, Xing Liu, Yu Liu, Jia Qing Yap, Andrea Wong, Adriana Crespo, Qi Lin, Zhiyuan Yin, Qiang Yan, Ryan Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) have propelled the evolution of multi-modal AI systems, which have demonstrated the remarkable potential for industrial applications by emulating human-like cognition. However, they also pose significant ethical challenges, including amplifying harmful content and reinforcing societal biases. For instance, biases in some industrial image generation models highlighted the urgent need for robust fairness assessments. Most existing evaluation frameworks focus on the comprehensiveness of various aspects of the models, but they exhibit critical limitations, including insufficient attention to content generation alignment and social bias-sensitive domains. More importantly, their reliance on pixel-detection techniques is prone to inaccuracies.
  To address these issues, this paper presents INFELM, an in-depth fairness evaluation on widely-used text-to-image models. Our key contributions are: (1) an advanced skintone classifier incorporating facial topology and refined skin pixel representation to enhance classification precision by at least 16.04%, (2) a bias-sensitive content alignment measurement for understanding societal impacts, (3) a generalizable representation bias evaluation for diverse demographic groups, and (4) extensive experiments analyzing large-scale text-to-image model outputs across six social-bias-sensitive domains. We find that existing models in the study generally do not meet the empirical fairness criteria, and representation bias is generally more pronounced than alignment errors. INFELM establishes a robust benchmark for fairness assessment, supporting the development of multi-modal AI systems that align with ethical and human-centric principles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces allow for more efficient modeling of complex, hierarchical structures, which is particularly beneficial in tasks involving multi-modal data. Although hyperbolic geometries have been proven effective for language-image pre-training, their capabilities to unify language, image, and 3D Point Cloud modalities are under-explored. We extend the 3D Point Cloud modality in hyperbolic multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Additionally, we explore the entailment, modality gap, and alignment regularizers for learning hierarchical 3D embeddings and facilitating the transfer of knowledge from both Text and Image modalities. These regularizers enable the learning of intra-modal hierarchy within each modality and inter-modal hierarchy across text, 2D images, and 3D Point Clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training strategy yields an outstanding 3D Point Cloud encoder, and the obtained 3D Point Cloud hierarchical embeddings significantly improve performance on various downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaojie Mao, Jingfeng Zhang, Yulin Pan, Zeyinzi Jiang, Zhen Han, Yu Liu, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We report ACE++, an instruction-based diffusion framework that tackles various image generation and editing tasks. Inspired by the input format for the inpainting task proposed by FLUX.1-Fill-dev, we improve the Long-context Condition Unit (LCU) introduced in ACE and extend this input paradigm to any editing and generation tasks. To take full advantage of image generative priors, we develop a two-stage training scheme to minimize the efforts of finetuning powerful text-to-image diffusion models like FLUX.1-dev. In the first stage, we pre-train the model using task data with the 0-ref tasks from the text-to-image model. There are many models in the community based on the post-training of text-to-image foundational models that meet this training paradigm of the first stage. For example, FLUX.1-Fill-dev deals primarily with painting tasks and can be used as an initialization to accelerate the training process. In the second stage, we finetune the above model to support the general instructions using all tasks defined in ACE. To promote the widespread application of ACE++ in different scenarios, we provide a comprehensive set of models that cover both full finetuning and lightweight finetuning, while considering general applicability and applicability in vertical scenarios. The qualitative analysis showcases the superiority of ACE++ in terms of generating image quality and prompt following ability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoran Feng, Wangbo Yu, Xinhua Cheng, Zhenyu Tang, Junwu Zhang, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to frame-based methods, computational neuromorphic imaging using event cameras offers significant advantages, such as minimal motion blur, enhanced temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. The multi-view consistency of Neural Radiance Fields combined with the unique benefits of event cameras, has spurred recent research into reconstructing NeRF from data captured by moving event cameras. While showing impressive performance, existing methods rely on ideal conditions with the availability of uniform and high-quality event sequences and accurate camera poses, and mainly focus on the object level reconstruction, thus limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose AE-NeRF to address the challenges of learning event-based NeRF from non-ideal conditions, including non-uniform event sequences, noisy poses, and various scales of scenes. Our method exploits the density of event streams and jointly learn a pose correction module with an event-based NeRF (e-NeRF) framework for robust 3D reconstruction from inaccurate camera poses. To generalize to larger scenes, we propose hierarchical event distillation with a proposal e-NeRF network and a vanilla e-NeRF network to resample and refine the reconstruction process. We further propose an event reconstruction loss and a temporal loss to improve the view consistency of the reconstructed scene. We established a comprehensive benchmark that includes large-scale scenes to simulate practical non-ideal conditions, incorporating both synthetic and challenging real-world event datasets. The experimental results show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in event-based 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Liu, Yuanzhi Zhu, Feiyu Gao, Zhibo Yang, Peng Wang, Junyang Lin, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating visual text in natural scene images is a challenging task with many unsolved problems. Different from generating text on artificially designed images (such as posters, covers, cartoons, etc.), the text in natural scene images needs to meet the following four key criteria: (1) Fidelity: the generated text should appear as realistic as a photograph and be completely accurate, with no errors in any of the strokes. (2) Reasonability: the text should be generated on reasonable carrier areas (such as boards, signs, walls, etc.), and the generated text content should also be relevant to the scene. (3) Utility: the generated text can facilitate to the training of natural scene OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks. (4) Controllability: The attribute of the text (such as font and color) should be controllable as needed. In this paper, we propose a two stage method, SceneVTG++, which simultaneously satisfies the four aspects mentioned above. SceneVTG++ consists of a Text Layout and Content Generator (TLCG) and a Controllable Local Text Diffusion (CLTD). The former utilizes the world knowledge of multi modal large language models to find reasonable text areas and recommend text content according to the nature scene background images, while the latter generates controllable multilingual text based on the diffusion model. Through extensive experiments, we respectively verified the effectiveness of TLCG and CLTD, and demonstrated the state-of-the-art text generation performance of SceneVTG++. In addition, the generated images have superior utility in OCR tasks like text detection and text recognition. Codes and datasets will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanpeng Hu, Haodi Liu, Lin Chen, Feng Zhou, Changming Xiao, Qi Yang, Changshui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex visual reasoning remains a key challenge today. Typically, the challenge is tackled using methodologies such as Chain of Thought (COT) and visual instruction tuning. However, how to organically combine these two methodologies for greater success remains unexplored. Also, issues like hallucinations and high training cost still need to be addressed. In this work, we devise an innovative multi-round training and reasoning framework suitable for lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our self-questioning approach heuristically guides MLLMs to focus on visual clues relevant to the target problem, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the model's ability to describe fine-grained image details. This ultimately enables the model to perform well in complex visual reasoning and question-answering tasks. We have named this framework Socratic Questioning(SQ). To facilitate future research, we create a multimodal mini-dataset named CapQA, which includes 1k images of fine-grained activities, for visual instruction tuning and evaluation, our proposed SQ method leads to a 31.2% improvement in the hallucination score. Our extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate SQ's remarkable capabilities in heuristic self-questioning, zero-shot visual reasoning and hallucination mitigation. Our model and code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Cen Chen, Wenmeng Zhou, Yinggui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to black-box adversarial attacks is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present BayAtk. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of BayAtk in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%. MULTI serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present and discuss the results of a qualitative analysis of visualization images to derive an image-based typology of visualizations. For each image, we seek to identify its main focus or the essential stimuli. As a result, we derived 10 image-based visualization types. We describe coding decisions we made in the derivation process. The resulting image typology can serve a number of purposes: enabling researchers and practitioners to identify visual design styles, facilitating the categorization of visualization images for the purpose of research and teaching, enabling researchers to study the evolution of the community and its research output over time, and facilitating a discussion of standardization in visualization. In addition, the tool and dataset enable scholars to closely examine the images and how they are published and communicated in our community. osf.io/dxjwt presents a pre-registration and all supplemental materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cynthia Maldonado-Garcia, Rodrigo Bonazzola, Enzo Ferrante, Thomas H Julian, Panagiotis I Sergouniotis, Nishant Ravikumara, Alejandro F Frangi</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Non-invasive, cost-effective imaging techniques play a crucial role in early detection and prevention of CVD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gained recognition as a potential tool for early CVD risk prediction, though its use remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of OCT as an additional imaging technique to predict future CVD events. We analysed retinal OCT data from the UK Biobank. The dataset included 612 patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within five years of imaging and 2,234 controls without CVD (total: 2,846 participants). A self-supervised deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) was used to extract low-dimensional latent representations from high-dimensional 3D OCT images, capturing distinct features of retinal layers. These latent features, along with clinical data, were used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier to differentiate between patients at risk of future CVD events (MI or stroke) and healthy controls. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.70, and accuracy of 0.70, outperforming the QRISK3 score (the third version of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk prediction algorithm; AUC = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.60, specificity = 0.55, accuracy = 0.55). The choroidal layer in OCT images was identified as a key predictor of future CVD events, revealed through a novel model explainability approach. This study demonstrates that retinal OCT imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for predicting CVD risk, offering potential for widespread application in optometry practices and hospitals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions and evaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DL reconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is an effective and widely used approach for weakly supervised machine learning. In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liu, Ke Xu, Liangbo L. Shen, Guillaume Huguet, Zilong Wang, Alexander Tong, Danilo Bzdok, Jay Stewart, Jay C. Wang, Lucian V. Del Priore, Smita Krishnaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection of longitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients over time, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqing Zhang, Jingyun Yang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As the rapid development of computer vision and the emergence of powerful network backbones and architectures, the application of deep learning in medical imaging has become increasingly significant. Unlike natural images, medical images lack huge volumes of data but feature more modalities, making it difficult to train a general model that has satisfactory performance across various datasets. In practice, practitioners often suffer from manually creating and testing models combining independent backbones and architectures, which is a laborious and time-consuming process. We propose Flemme, a FLExible and Modular learning platform for MEdical images. Our platform separates encoders from the model architectures so that different models can be constructed via various combinations of supported encoders and architectures. We construct encoders using building blocks based on convolution, transformer, and state-space model (SSM) to process both 2D and 3D image patches. A base architecture is implemented following an encoder-decoder style, with several derived architectures for image segmentation, reconstruction, and generation tasks. In addition, we propose a general hierarchical architecture incorporating a pyramid loss to optimize and fuse vertical features. Experiments demonstrate that this simple design leads to an average improvement of 5.60% in Dice score and 7.81% in mean interaction of units (mIoU) for segmentation models, as well as an enhancement of 5.57% in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and 8.22% in structural similarity (SSIM) for reconstruction models. We further utilize Flemme as an analytical tool to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various encoders across different tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei He, Yuzheng Hu, Yong Lin, Tong Zhang, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: In the field of industrial inspection, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a high potential to renew the paradigms in practical applications due to their robust language capabilities and generalization abilities. However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmin Park, Sebin Kim, Taehong Moon, Minkyu Kim, Kangwook Lee, Jaewoong Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<p>Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Zhu, Kai Li, Guojing Zhang, Xiaoying Wang, Jianqiang Huang, Xilai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR reconstruction by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose Wavelet Loss, a loss function that effectively captures high-frequency detail information in images, thereby enhancing the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including AID, AID_CDM, RSSRD-QH, and RSSRD-QH_CDM, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.05 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 2.9 times faster. Furthermore, the Wavelet Loss shows excellent generalization across various architectures, providing a novel perspective for RSI-SR enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rezkellah Noureddine Khiati, Pierre-Yves Brillet, Radu Ispas, Catalin Fetita</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate quantification of the extent of lung pathological patterns (fibrosis, ground-glass opacity, emphysema, consolidation) is prerequisite for diagnosis and follow-up of interstitial lung diseases. However, segmentation is challenging due to the significant class imbalance between healthy and pathological tissues. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging a diffusion model for data augmentation applied during training an AI model. Our approach generates synthetic pathological tissue patches while preserving essential shape characteristics and intricate details specific to each tissue type. This method enhances the segmentation process by increasing the occurence of underrepresented classes in the training data. We demonstrate that our diffusion-based augmentation technique improves segmentation accuracy across all pathological tissue types, particularly for the less common patterns. This advancement contributes to more reliable automated analysis of lung CT scans, potentially improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes</p>
