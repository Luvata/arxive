<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Qi, Hanzhang Fang, Tianxing Hu, Siqi Jiang, Wei Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16977">Tokenization Matters: Improving Zero-Shot NER for Indic Languages</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyaranjan Pattnayak, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Amit Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Moroni, Giovanni Puccetti, Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Edoardo Barba, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Andrea Esuli, Roberto Navigli</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily, though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility") and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally, we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and generative tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052">Do Words Reflect Beliefs? Evaluating Belief Depth in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shariar Kabir, Kevin Esterling, Yue Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse, yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny. While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains: Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance. Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability assessments for real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075">Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Subramonian, Vagrant Gautam, Preethi Seshadri, Dietrich Klakow, Kai-Wei Chang, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences) and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rendi Chevi, Kentaro Inui, Thamar Solorio, Alham Fikri Aji</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users' preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences: enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject. Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and which language styles influence the preference varied across different user populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples, which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style, individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential causal relationship between and beyond these variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghyun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI, opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished, undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent, modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite substantial progress in healthcare applications driven by large language models (LLMs), growing concerns around data privacy, and limited resources; the small language models (SLMs) offer a scalable and clinically viable solution for efficient performance in resource-constrained environments for next-generation healthcare informatics. Our comprehensive survey presents a taxonomic framework to identify and categorize them for healthcare professionals and informaticians. The timeline of healthcare SLM contributions establishes a foundational framework for analyzing models across three dimensions: NLP tasks, stakeholder roles, and the continuum of care. We present a taxonomic framework to identify the architectural foundations for building models from scratch; adapting SLMs to clinical precision through prompting, instruction fine-tuning, and reasoning; and accessibility and sustainability through compression techniques. Our primary objective is to offer a comprehensive survey for healthcare professionals, introducing recent innovations in model optimization and equipping them with curated resources to support future research and development in the field. Aiming to showcase the groundbreaking advancements in SLMs for healthcare, we present a comprehensive compilation of experimental results across widely studied NLP tasks in healthcare to highlight the transformative potential of SLMs in healthcare.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanhee Park, Hyeonseok Moon, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between retrieval and generation components. This limitation has resulted in a scarcity of benchmarks that facilitate a detailed, component-specific assessment. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, allowing for seamless integration and customization in diverse research settings\footnote{The MIRAGE code and data are available at https://github.com/nlpai-lab/MIRAGE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minju Seo, Jinheon Baek, Seongyun Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17220">Does Knowledge Distillation Matter for Large Language Model based Bundle Generation?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaidong Feng, Zhu Sun, Jie Yang, Hui Fang, Xinghua Qu, Wenyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts); (ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques (in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl, all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy. To further enhance performance, we apply transfer learning using MarianNMT pre-trained models within the SimpleTransformers framework. Our RNN-based system achieves competitive results, closely matching existing English-Igbo benchmarks. With transfer learning, we observe a performance gain of +4.83 BLEU points, reaching an estimated translation accuracy of 70%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining RNNs with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language translation tasks.</p>

However, its application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains. Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Juexiao Zhou, Zirui Song, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races, sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales, and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Zhang, Shuliang Liu, Aiwei Liu, Yubo Gao, Jungang Li, Xiaojie Gu, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulia Otmakhova, Hung Thinh Truong, Rahmad Mahendra, Zenan Zhai, Rongxin Zhu, Daniel Beck, Jey Han Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Lu Yuan, Zhengxuan Zhang, Qing Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation. Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengguang Gan, Sunbowen Lee, Zhixi Cai, Yanbin Wei, Lei Zheng, Yunhao Liang, Shiwen Ni, Tatsunori Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the textual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose G. Moreno (IRIT-IRIS), Jesus Lovon (IRIT-IRIS), M'Rick Robin-Charlet (UT3), Christine Damase-Michel (IRIT-IRIS), Lynda Tamine (IRIT-IRIS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data. Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/ Jgmorenof/mistral\_merged\_0\_4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxuan Wu, Runyu Chen, Peiyu Liu, Hongjin Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent, and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems.

<p>Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen domains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Lieb, Maneesh Arora, Eni Mustafaraj</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific research questions with minimal human guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Yi, Shunfan Zhengc, Linlin Wanga, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejin Bang, Ziwei Ji, Alan Schelten, Anthony Hartshorn, Tara Fowler, Cheng Zhang, Nicola Cancedda, Pascale Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs. This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from factuality evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rei Higuchi, Ryotaro Kawata, Naoki Nishikawa, Kazusato Oko, Shoichiro Yamaguchi, Sosuke Kobayashi, Seiya Tokui, Kohei Hayashi, Daisuke Okanohara, Taiji Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M</p>

Experiments on the Weibo1-Rumor dataset demonstrate that RAGAT-Mind achieves superior classification performance, attaining 99.2% accuracy and a macro-F1 score of 0.9919. The results validate the effectiveness of combining hierarchical linguistic features with graph-based semantic structures.

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of abusive language in online communications has posed significant risks to the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities. The growing concern regarding online abuse and its consequences necessitates methods for identifying and mitigating harmful content and facilitating continuous monitoring, moderation, and early intervention. This paper presents a taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within online text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development, integrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to capture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification. The resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and 17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context, target, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding can lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and accelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among researchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zena Al-Khalili, Nick Howell, Dietrich Klakow</p>
<p>Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchang Ye, Weiyan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our approach.</p>

We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anuja Tayal, Devika Salunke, Barbara Di Eugenio, Paula Allen-Meares, Eulalia Puig Abril, Olga Garcia, Carolyn Dickens, Andrew Boyd</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture, and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no preference for one over the other.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Nawrot, Robert Li, Renjie Huang, Sebastian Ruder, Kelly Marchisio, Edoardo M. Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emre Can Acikgoz, Cheng Qian, Hongru Wang, Vardhan Dongre, Xiusi Chen, Heng Ji, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur, Gokhan Tur</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Karbasi, Omar Montasser, John Sous, Grigoris Velegkas</p>
<p>Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The paper presents the Source Code Analysis and Lexical Annotation Runtime (SCALAR), a tool specialized for mapping (annotating) source code identifier names to their corresponding part-of-speech tag sequence (grammar pattern). SCALAR's internal model is trained using scikit-learn's GradientBoostingClassifier in conjunction with a manually-curated oracle of identifier names and their grammar patterns. This specializes the tagger to recognize the unique structure of the natural language used by developers to create all types of identifiers (e.g., function names, variable names etc.). SCALAR's output is compared with a previous version of the tagger, as well as a modern off-the-shelf part-of-speech tagger to show how it improves upon other taggers' output for annotating identifiers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling You, Wenxuan Huang, Xinni Xie, Xiangyi Wei, Bangyan Li, Shaohui Lin, Yang Li, Changbo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhang, Jue Wang, Huan Li, Lidan Shou, Ke Chen, Gang Chen, Qin Xie, Guiming Xie, Xuejian Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs), which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Bela Gipp, Terry Ruas</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstractive dialogue summarization is the task of distilling conversations into informative and concise summaries. Although reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of dialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and aligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that while some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly due to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and salience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We investigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established automatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all subdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is frequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanis Labrak, Markus Frohmann, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Elena V. Epure</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate music content, particularly lyrics, has gained in popularity. These advances provide valuable tools for artists and enhance their creative processes, but they also raise concerns about copyright violations, consumer satisfaction, and content spamming. Previous research has explored content detection in various domains. However, no work has focused on the text modality, lyrics, in music. To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough evaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a previously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the best-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation. Following both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these approaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle multilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot settings. Our findings show promising results that could inform policy decisions around AI-generated music and enhance transparency for users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikai Wang, Yi Su, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Zi Ye, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive language models demonstrate excellent performance in various scenarios. However, the inference efficiency is limited by its one-step-one-word generation mode, which has become a pressing problem recently as the models become increasingly larger. Speculative decoding employs a "draft and then verify" mechanism to allow multiple tokens to be generated in one step, realizing lossless acceleration. Existing methods mainly adopt fixed heuristic draft structures, which fail to adapt to different situations to maximize the acceptance length during verification. To alleviate this dilemma, we proposed OPT-Tree, an algorithm to construct adaptive and scalable draft trees. It searches the optimal tree structure that maximizes the mathematical expectation of the acceptance length in each decoding step. Experimental results reveal that OPT-Tree outperforms the existing draft structures and achieves a speed-up ratio of up to 3.2 compared with autoregressive decoding. If the draft model is powerful enough and the node budget is sufficient, it can generate more than ten tokens in a single step. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jikai0Wang/OPT-Tree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yetao Wu, Yihong Wang, Teng Chen, Ningyuan Xi, Qingqing Gu, Hongyang Lei, Luo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination is a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), preventing their further application in some fields. The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence. Project code and model checkpoints can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SM-1E76.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maojia Song, Shang Hong Sim, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Hai Leong Chieu, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

<p>Abstract: Accurate interpretation of lab results is crucial in clinical medicine, yet most patient portals use universal normal ranges, ignoring conditional factors like age and gender. This study introduces Lab-AI, an interactive system that offers personalized normal ranges using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from credible health sources. Lab-AI has two modules: factor retrieval and normal range retrieval. We tested these on 122 lab tests: 40 with conditional factors and 82 without. For tests with factors, normal ranges depend on patient-specific information. Our results show GPT-4-turbo with RAG achieved a 0.948 F1 score for factor retrieval and 0.995 accuracy for normal range retrieval. GPT-4-turbo with RAG outperformed the best non-RAG system by 33.5% in factor retrieval and showed 132% and 100% improvements in question-level and lab-level performance, respectively, for normal range retrieval. These findings highlight Lab-AI's potential to enhance patient understanding of lab results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Aycock, David Stap, Di Wu, Christof Monz, Khalil Sima'an</p>
<p>Abstract: Extremely low-resource (XLR) languages lack substantial corpora for training NLP models, motivating the use of all available resources such as dictionaries and grammar books. Machine Translation from One Book (Tanzer et al., 2024) suggests that prompting long-context LLMs with one grammar book enables English-Kalamang translation, an XLR language unseen by LLMs - a noteworthy case of linguistics helping an NLP task. We investigate the source of this translation ability, finding almost all improvements stem from the book's parallel examples rather than its grammatical explanations. We find similar results for Nepali and Guarani, seen low-resource languages, and we achieve performance comparable to an LLM with a grammar book by simply fine-tuning an encoder-decoder translation model. We then investigate where grammar books help by testing two linguistic tasks, grammaticality judgment and gloss prediction, and we explore what kind of grammatical knowledge helps by introducing a typological feature prompt that achieves leading results on these more relevant tasks. We thus emphasise the importance of task-appropriate data for XLR languages: parallel examples for translation, and grammatical data for linguistic tasks. As we find no evidence that long-context LLMs can make effective use of grammatical explanations for XLR translation, we conclude data collection for multilingual XLR tasks such as translation is best focused on parallel data over linguistic description.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danqing Wang, Jianxin Ma, Fei Fang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in solving complex problems. However, current approaches primarily enhance reasoning through the elaboration of thoughts while neglecting the diversity of reasoning types. LLMs typically employ deductive reasoning, proceeding step-by-step from given conditions, which limits their exploration during problem-solving. Our analysis reveals that certain problems are exclusively solvable through specific reasoning strategies like inductive, abductive, or analogical reasoning. However, incorporating diverse reasoning approaches presents two key challenges: identifying the appropriate reasoning type for each problem and exploiting this approach during problem-solving. Therefore, we propose the TypedThinker that predicts suitable reasoning types based on the problem and their previous effectiveness and provides relevant demonstrations to guide LLMs in applying these strategies. Experimental results show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, with performance gains of 3.4% for Mistral 7B, 6.5% for LLaMA3 8B, and 7% for Qwen 2 7B on logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. TypedThinker enhances LLM reasoning without requiring knowledge distillation from larger models. It can be integrated into more advanced systems like GPT-4o or specialized models like MetaMath to diversify their reasoning approaches and improve their problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Leviathan, Matan Kalman, Yossi Matias</p>
<p>Abstract: Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</p>

<p>Abstract: The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gideon Yoffe, Nachum Dershowitz, Ariel Vishne, Barak Sober</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a data-centric hypothesis-testing framework to quantify the influence of sequentially correlated literary properties--such as thematic continuity--on textual classification tasks. Our method models label sequences as stochastic processes and uses an empirical autocovariance matrix to generate surrogate labelings that preserve sequential dependencies. This enables statistical testing to determine whether classification outcomes are primarily driven by thematic structure or by non-sequential features like authorial style. Applying this framework across a diverse corpus of English prose, we compare traditional (word n-grams and character k-mers) and neural (contrastively trained) embeddings in both supervised and unsupervised classification settings. Crucially, our method identifies when classifications are confounded by sequentially correlated similarity, revealing that supervised and neural models are more prone to false positives--mistaking shared themes and cross-genre differences for stylistic signals. In contrast, unsupervised models using traditional features often yield high true positive rates with minimal false positives, especially in genre-consistent settings. By disentangling sequential from non-sequential influences, our approach provides a principled way to assess and interpret classification reliability. This is particularly impactful for authorship attribution, forensic linguistics, and the analysis of redacted or composite texts, where conventional methods may conflate theme with style. Our results demonstrate that controlling for sequential correlation is essential for reducing false positives and ensuring that classification outcomes reflect genuine stylistic distinctions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Koukounas, Georgios Mastrapas, Sedigheh Eslami, Bo Wang, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Michael G\"unther, Isabelle Mohr, Saba Sturua, Nan Wang, Han Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely used for crossmodal information retrieval and multimodal understanding tasks. However, CLIP models are mainly optimized for crossmodal vision-language tasks and underperform in single-mode text tasks. Moreover, these models are often trained on English datasets and therefore lack multilingual understanding. Additionally, from a visual understanding perspective, previous CLIP-based models exhibit insufficient understanding of visually rich documents. In this work, we propose jina-clip-v2, a contrastive vision-language model trained on text pairs, triplets and image-text pairs via a multi-task and multi-stage contrastive learning paradigm in order to support both text-only and crossmodal tasks. We employ a multilingual text encoder and expand the training dataset to include multilingual texts from 29 non-English languages, including Hindi, Chinese, German, French, and others, as well as images of visually rich documents. We evaluate the model's performance and show that jina-clip-v2 achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-based models in zero-shot text-only retrieval, semantic textual similarity, and crossmodal retrieval tasks in both English and multilingual settings. jina-clip-v2 also provides for flexibility in embedding dimensionality, enabling users to select the granularity of the representations. jina-clip-v2 is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-clip-v2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Boldo, Lily Pemberton, Gabriel Thistledown, Jacob Fairchild, Felix Kowalski</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of contextual embeddings into the optimization processes of large language models is an advancement in natural language processing. The Context-Aware Neural Gradient Mapping framework introduces a dynamic gradient adjustment mechanism, incorporating contextual embeddings directly into the optimization process. This approach facilitates real-time parameter adjustments, enhancing task-specific generalization even in the presence of sparse or noisy data inputs. The mathematical foundation of this framework relies on gradient descent modifications, where contextual embeddings are derived from a supplementary neural network trained to map input features to optimal adaptation gradients. By employing differential geometry principles, high-dimensional input dependencies are encoded into low-dimensional gradient manifolds, enabling efficient adaptation without necessitating the retraining of the entire model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various metrics, including accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. The integration of context-specific embeddings allows for a more complex understanding of language, thereby improving the model's ability to handle diverse linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the computational efficiency achieved through this method demonstrates its scalability for large-scale language models operating under diverse constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpita Vats, Rahul Raja, Mrinal Mathur, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: The diversity and complexity of Indic languages present unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA).To address these challenges, this paper explores the application of State Space Models (SSMs),to build efficient and contextually aware QA systems tailored for Indic languages. SSMs are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to model long-term and short-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-equipped to handle the rich morphology, complex syntax, and contextual intricacies characteristic of Indian languages. We evaluated multiple SSM architectures across diverse datasets representing various Indic languages and conducted a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that these models effectively capture linguistic subtleties, leading to significant improvements in question interpretation, context alignment, and answer generation. This work represents the first application of SSMs to question answering tasks in Indic languages, establishing a foundational benchmark for future research in this domain. We propose enhancements to existing SSM frameworks, optimizing their applicability to low-resource settings and multilingual scenarios prevalent in Indic languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Nightingale, Dominic Lavington, Jonathan Thistlethwaite, Sebastian Penhaligon, Thomas Belinski, David Boldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing token embeddings as probability distributions over learned manifolds allows for more flexible contextual inference, reducing representational rigidity while enhancing semantic granularity. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that probabilistic embeddings improve neighborhood consistency and decrease redundancy, ensuring that token relationships remain more structurally coherent across fine-tuning iterations. The integration of probabilistic subspaces within attention mechanisms facilitates more adaptive contextual weighting, enabling models to capture latent dependencies that would otherwise be obscured in conventional embeddings. Experimental results highlight increased robustness against adversarial modifications, with probabilistic embeddings preserving contextual integrity even under perturbation-based evaluation scenarios. Performance assessments indicate that probabilistic representations achieve greater adaptability in domain-specific applications, mitigating the need for extensive retraining when shifting across linguistic domains. Computational trade-offs remain within operationally feasible limits, with marginal increases in inference latency balanced against the benefits of enhanced representation stability and contextual expressiveness. The capacity to encode structured uncertainty provides advantages in generative modeling tasks, particularly where maintaining coherence across extended sequences requires a representation framework capable of handling ambiguous or context-dependent linguistic constructs.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11569">Towards Reasoning Ability of Small Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Srivastava, Shuxiang Cao, Xuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zou, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Evangelos Kanoulas, Shuxi Han, Heli Ma, Zheng Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational Product Search ( CPS ) systems interact with users via natural language to offer personalized and context-aware product lists. However, most existing research on CPS is limited to simulated conversations, due to the lack of a real CPS dataset driven by human-like language. Moreover, existing conversational datasets for e-commerce are constructed for a particular market or a particular language and thus can not support cross-market and multi-lingual usage. In this paper, we propose a CPS data collection protocol and create a new CPS dataset, called PSCon, which assists product search through conversations with human-like language. The dataset is collected by a coached human-human data collection protocol and is available for dual markets and two languages. By formulating the task of CPS, the dataset allows for comprehensive and in-depth research on six subtasks: user intent detection, keyword extraction, system action prediction, question selection, item ranking, and response generation. Moreover, we present a concise analysis of the dataset and propose a benchmark model on the proposed CPS dataset. Our proposed dataset and model will be helpful for facilitating future research on CPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress, but it faces challenges such as reviewer shortages and growing workloads. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for providing assistance, research has reported significant limitations in the reviews they generate. While the insights are valuable, conducting the analysis is challenging due to the considerable time and effort required, especially given the rapid pace of LLM developments. To address the challenge, we developed an automatic evaluation pipeline to assess the LLMs' paper review capability by comparing them with expert-generated reviews. By constructing a dataset consisting of 676 OpenReview papers, we examined the agreement between LLMs and experts in their strength and weakness identifications. The results showed that LLMs lack balanced perspectives, significantly overlook novelty assessment when criticizing, and produce poor acceptance decisions. Our automated pipeline enables a scalable evaluation of LLMs' paper review capability over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuding Sun, Jing Huang, Sidharth Baskaran, Karel D'Oosterlinck, Christopher Potts, Michael Sklar, Atticus Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has made great strides in identifying neural network features (e.g., directions in hidden activation space) that mediate concepts(e.g., the birth year of a person) and enable predictable manipulation. Distributed alignment search (DAS) leverages supervision from counterfactual data to learn concept features within hidden states, but DAS assumes we can afford to conduct a brute force search over potential feature locations. To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lee, Melanie Weber, Fernanda Vi\'egas, Martin Wattenberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. In our work, we find that token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we introduce Emb2Emb, a simple method to transfer steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aravind Krishnan, Siva Reddy, Marius Mosbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combines techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress models to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Mei, Wei Fu, Kaiwei Li, Guangju Wang, Huanchen Zhang, Yi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaolin Gao, Wenhao Zhan, Jonathan D. Chang, Gokul Swamy, Kiant\'e Brantley, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yewei Song, Xunzhu Tang, Cedric Lothritz, Saad Ezzini, Jacques Klein, Tegawend\'e F. Bissyand\'e, Andrey Boytsov, Ulrick Ble, Anne Goujon</p>
<p>Abstract: API-driven chatbot systems are increasingly integral to software engineering applications, yet their effectiveness hinges on accurately generating and executing API calls. This is particularly challenging in scenarios requiring multi-step interactions with complex parameterization and nested API dependencies. Addressing these challenges, this work contributes to the evaluation and assessment of AI-based software development through three key advancements: (1) the introduction of a novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API execution; (2) an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, analyzing their performance across varying task complexities in API function generation and parameter accuracy; and (3) a hybrid approach to API routing, combining general-purpose large language models for API selection with fine-tuned models and prompt engineering for parameter generation. These innovations significantly improve API execution in chatbot systems, offering practical methodologies for enhancing software design, testing, and operational workflows in real-world software engineering contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Yin, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Liu, Jingwei Sun, Yueqian Lin, Jingyang Zhang, Ming Yin, Qinsi Wang, Jianyi Zhang, Hai Li, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11336">Looking beyond the next token</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abitha Thankaraj, Yiding Jiang, J. Zico Kolter, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11364">Teaching Large Language Models to Reason through Learning and Forgetting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Ni, Allen Nie, Sapana Chaudhary, Yao Liu, Huzefa Rangwala, Rasool Fakoor</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning is an essential skill to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with the world. As tasks become more complex, they demand increasingly sophisticated and diverse reasoning capabilities for sequential decision-making, requiring structured reasoning over the context history to determine the next best action. We introduce TALES, a diverse collection of synthetic and human-written text-adventure games designed to challenge and evaluate diverse reasoning capabilities. We present results over a range of LLMs, open- and closed-weights, performing a qualitative analysis on the top performing models. Despite an impressive showing on synthetic games, even the top LLM-driven agents fail to achieve 15% on games designed for human enjoyment.
